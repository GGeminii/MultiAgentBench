task:
  content: "Software Development Task:\n\nPlease write a multi-agent system called
    'CyberArena' that simulates a futuristic battle arena where multiple AI-controlled
    robots compete in team-based challenges. CyberArena is a dynamic action game that
    allows robots to collaborate, adapt to changing environments, and use a variety
    of weapons and abilities to outsmart and outmaneuver their opponents.\n1. Implementation
    requirements:\n   - Implement a real-time combat system where robots can engage
    in battles using a variety of weapons, including ranged and melee attacks.\n \
    \  - Design a team-based objective system where robots must work together to complete
    tasks, such as capturing flags, defending bases, or escorting payloads, with dynamic
    roles and responsibilities.\n   - Incorporate an adaptive difficulty system that
    adjusts the AI behavior and challenge level based on the performance of the robots,
    ensuring a balanced and engaging experience.\n   - Create a feedback loop where
    robots can learn from previous battles, adapt their strategies, and improve their
    teamwork over time.\n   - Develop a visual and audio environment that enhances
    the immersive experience, including dynamic lighting, particle effects, and realistic
    sound effects.\n   - Ensure smooth and responsive controls for the robots, allowing
    for fluid movement and precise actions, and provide options for customizing control
    schemes.\n   - Include a variety of power-ups and environmental hazards that can
    be strategically used to gain advantages or create obstacles for opponents.\n\
    \   - Implement a scoring system that rewards effective teamwork, strategic play,
    and successful completion of objectives, with clear visual and audio feedback
    to players.\n\n\n2. Project structure:\n   - solution.py (main implementation)\n\
    \n3. Development process:\n   - Developer: Create the code.\n   - Developer: Revise
    the code.\n   - Developer: Optimize the code.\n\nIf there are multiple files,
    please put them all in solution.py, but remember to add the file name in the following
    format:\n```python\n# file_name_1.py\n# your code here\n\n# file_name_2.py\n#
    your code here\n\n# file_name_3.py\n# your code here\n```\n\nPlease work together
    to complete this task following software engineering best practices."

      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description
      and requirements.

      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration
      at first.

      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative
      or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create
      the code and I **can''t** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.

      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it''s better to let agent 2
      revise the code at first.

      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it''s
      better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so
      that the code is more optimized.
