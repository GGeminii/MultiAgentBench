  content: "Software Development Task:\n\nPlease write a software application called
    Board_Game_Team_Collaborator that facilitates team-based board game play by dynamically
    managing team compositions, tracking team scores, and providing real-time feedback
    and suggestions to improve team performance.\n1. Implementation requirements:\n\
    \   - The application should allow users to create and manage teams, including
    assigning players to specific teams and roles within the game.\n   - It should
    provide a real-time leaderboard that updates as players input their scores, displaying
    the current standings of each team.\n   - The application should include a machine
    learning component that analyzes team performance and suggests strategies or adjustments
    to improve team scores based on previous gameplay patterns and current performance.\n\
    \   - The system should be adaptive, allowing for dynamic changes in team compositions
    and roles based on user feedback or performance metrics.\n   - The application
    should support multiple board games, with customizable settings for each game,
    such as game type, number of players, and scoring rules.\n   - It should offer
    a user-friendly interface with clear visualizations of team scores, performance
    metrics, and suggestions for improvement.\n   - The application should provide
    notifications and alerts to teams when it's their turn to play, and automatically
    adjust the turn order based on the game rules and team performance.\n\n\n2. Project
    structure:\n   - solution.py (main implementation)\n\n3. Development process:\n\
    \   - Developer: Create the code.\n   - Developer: Revise the code.\n   - Developer:
    Optimize the code.\n\nIf there are multiple files, please put them all in solution.py,
    but remember to add the file name in the following format:\n```python\n# file_name_1.py\n\
    # your code here\n\n# file_name_2.py\n# your code here\n\n# file_name_3.py\n#
    your code here\n```\n\nPlease work together to complete this task following software
    engineering best practices."

      I am good at creating the code framework from scratch based on the task description
      and requirements.

      So I **have to** call "create_code" action to create the code in the first iteration
      at first.

      I am **very terrible** at do further modifications since I am not so creative
      or careful so I **have to** let agent 2 or agent 3 revise the code after I create
      the code and I **can''t** call "give_advice_and_revise_code" action.

      Agent 2 is better at adding missing functions so it''s better to let agent 2
      revise the code at first.

      Agent 3 is better at fixing existing issues and optimizing the code so it''s
      better to let agent 3 revise the code after agent 2 has revised the code so
      that the code is more optimized.
