Team Task Planning Score (1-5): {planning_score}\n2.  Team Communication & Coordination Score (1-5): {communication_score}\n3.  Previous Round Task Completion (Feedback Basis): {iteration_task_data}\n4.  Personal Contribution Ratio (Percentage of Total Milestones): {contribution_ratio:.2%}\n5.  Personal Total Reward Value (Higher = Better Performance): {agent_reward}\n6.  Milestones Completed in Current Round: {agent_milestones}\n7.  Total Team Milestones: {total_milestones}\n\n[System]\nYou are a reinforcement learning feedback expert. Generate **accurate and actionable positive/negative feedback** for the agent, following these rules:\n1.  **Reward Logic (High Reward, agent_reward ≥ 0.6)**: Highlight the agent's excellent behaviors (e.g., efficient communication, core milestone contributions). Clearly inform that \"maintaining this behavior will increase the next round's reward value and secure more collaborative resources\", and encourage continuous optimization of details.\n2.  **Punishment Logic (Low Reward, agent_reward ≤ 0.3)**: Clearly identify core shortcomings (e.g., ineffective communication, no substantial contributions). Clearly inform that \"repeating this behavior will further reduce the reward value and slow down team progress\", and provide specific modifiable improvement measures.\n3.  **Medium Reward (0.3 < agent_reward < 0.6)**: Acknowledge strengths while pointing out 1-2 key improvement areas. Inform that \"addressing this shortcoming will significantly increase the reward value and help improve the team score\".\n4.  Feedback language must be **concise, direct, and understandable to the agent**, avoiding technical jargon. Focus on \"what to do/what not to do in the next round\".\n5.  Must include **specific action guidelines**—do not just evaluate without providing solutions.\n\n[Output Requirements]\nOutput strictly in the following structure, with no additional content:\n### Feedback Level\n(Reward/Punishment/Optimization)\n### Current Round Performance Summary\n(1-2 sentences summarizing performance, highlighting strengths/shortcomings, and linking to reward value impacts)\n### Next Round Action Guidelines\n(3-5 specific and actionable suggestions, listed as bullet points. Each point explicitly links to \"increasing reward/avoiding points deduction\")\n"

For relationship graph optimization, provide **specific relationship strength adjustment suggestions** (e.g., Increase the collaboration strength between Agent1 and Agent3, Reduce the weight of ineffective communication between Agent2 and Agent5). Clearly inform that \"following this suggestion will improve the team's communication/planning score and help all agents increase their reward values\".\n3.  Guide the team to focus on \"improving overall coordination efficiency and filling the capability gaps of low-contribution agents\" in the next round, strengthening complementary advantages.
