A key challenge in\nFL is statistical heterogeneity, e.g., the not independent and\nidentically distributed (Non-IID) and unbalanced data across\nclients. This kind of data makes it hard to obtain a global\nmodel that generalizes to each client (McMahan et al. 2017;\nReisizadeh et al. 2020; T Dinh, Tran, and Nguyen 2020).\nPersonalized FL (pFL) Related Work\nTraditional Federated Learning\nThe widely known traditional FL method FedAvg (McMa-\nhan et al. 2017) learns a single global model for all clientsby aggregating their local models. However, it often suffers\nin statistically heterogeneous settings, e.g., FL with Non-\nIID and unbalanced data (Kairouz et al. 2019; Zhao et al.\n2018). To address this issue, FedProx (Li et al. 2020) im-\nproves the stability of the FL process through a proximal\nterm. To counteract the bias introduced by the Non-IID data,\nFA VOR (Wang et al. 2020a) selects a subset of clients based\non deep Q-learning (Van Hasselt, Guez, and Silver 2016)\nat each iteration. By generating the global model layer-\nwise, FedMA (Wang et al. 2020b) can adapt to statistical\nheterogeneity with the matched averaging approach.

Conventional federated learning architecture, inherited from the parameter server design, relies on highly centralized topologies and the assumption of large nodes-to-server bandwidths. However, in real-world federated learning scenarios the network capacities between nodes are highly uniformly distributed and smaller than that in a datacenter. It is of great challenges for conventional federated learning approaches to efficiently utilize network capacities between nodes.

Recently, federated learning provides a secure and trustable alternative to collaboratively train model without any exchange of medical data among multiple institutes. Therefore, it has draw much attention due to its natural merit on privacy protection. However, when heterogenous medical data exists between different hospitals, federated learning usually has to face with degradation of performance. In the paper, we propose a new personalized framework of federated learning to handle the problem. It successfully yields personalized models based on awareness of similarity between local data, and achieves better tradeoff between generalization and personalization than existing methods. After that, we further design a differentially sparse regularizer to improve communication efficiency during procedure of model training. Additionally, we propose an effective method to reduce the computational cost, which improves computation efficiency significantly.

A key challenge in\nFL is statistical heterogeneity, e.g., the not independent and\nidentically distributed (Non-IID) and unbalanced data across\nclients. This kind of data makes it hard to obtain a global\nmodel that generalizes to each client (McMahan et al. 2017;\nReisizadeh et al. 2020; T Dinh, Tran, and Nguyen 2020).\nPersonalized FL (pFL) Related Work\nTraditional Federated Learning\nThe widely known traditional FL method FedAvg (McMa-\nhan et al. 2017) learns a single global model for all clientsby aggregating their local models. However, it often suffers\nin statistically heterogeneous settings, e.g., FL with Non-\nIID and unbalanced data (Kairouz et al. 2019; Zhao et al.\n2018). To address this issue, FedProx (Li et al. 2020) im-\nproves the stability of the FL process through a proximal\nterm. To counteract the bias introduced by the Non-IID data,\nFA VOR (Wang et al. 2020a) selects a subset of clients based\non deep Q-learning (Van Hasselt, Guez, and Silver 2016)\nat each iteration. By generating the global model layer-\nwise, FedMA (Wang et al. 2020b) can adapt to statistical\nheterogeneity with the matched averaging approach. How-\never, with statistical heterogeneity in FL, it is hard to ob-\ntain a single global model which generalizes well to each\nclient (Kairouz et al. 2019; Huang et al. 2021; T Dinh, Tran,\nand Nguyen 2020).\nPersonalized Federated Learning\nRecently, personalization has attracted much attention for\ntackling statistical heterogeneity in FL (Kairouz et al. 2019).\nWe consider the following three categories of pFL Methods with Dynamic Bound of Learning Rate.\nInICLR .\nMcMahan, B.; Moore, E.; Ramage, D.; Hampson, S.; and\ny Arcas, B.

A key challenge in\nFL is statistical heterogeneity, e.g., the not independent and\nidentically distributed (Non-IID) and unbalanced data across\nclients. This kind of data makes it hard to obtain a global\nmodel that generalizes to each client (McMahan et al. 2017;\nReisizadeh et al. 2020; T Dinh, Tran, and Nguyen 2020).\nPersonalized FL (pFL) Related Work\nTraditional Federated Learning\nThe widely known traditional FL method FedAvg (McMa-\nhan et al. 2017) learns a single global model for all clientsby aggregating their local models. However, it often suffers\nin statistically heterogeneous settings, e.g., FL with Non-\nIID and unbalanced data (Kairouz et al. 2019; Zhao et al.\n2018). To address this issue, FedProx (Li et al. 2020) im-\nproves the stability of the FL process through a proximal\nterm. To counteract the bias introduced by the Non-IID data,\nFA VOR (Wang et al. 2020a) selects a subset of clients based\non deep Q-learning (Van Hasselt, Guez, and Silver 2016)\nat each iteration. By generating the global model layer-\nwise, FedMA (Wang et al. 2020b) can adapt to statistical\nheterogeneity with the matched averaging approach. How-\never, with statistical heterogeneity in FL, it is hard to ob-\ntain a single global model which generalizes well to each\nclient (Kairouz et al. 2019; Huang et al. 2021; T Dinh, Tran,\nand Nguyen 2020).\nPersonalized Federated Learning\nRecently, personalization has attracted much attention for\ntackling statistical heterogeneity in FL (Kairouz et al. 2019).\nWe consider the following three categories of pFL Methods with Dynamic Bound of Learning Rate.\nInICLR .\nMcMahan, B.; Moore, E.; Ramage, D.; Hampson, S.; and\ny Arcas, B.

Recently, federated learning provides a secure and trustable alternative to collaboratively train model without any exchange of medical data among multiple institutes. Therefore, it has draw much attention due to its natural merit on privacy protection. However, when heterogenous medical data exists between different hospitals, federated learning usually has to face with degradation of performance. In the paper, we propose a new personalized framework of federated learning to handle the problem.

Apart from the huge consumption of manpower, computation and memory resources, most of these models seek point estimation of their parameters, and are prone to overfitting to small training data. This paper presents an adaptive kernel nonlinear max-margin multi-view learning model under the Bayesian framework. Specifically, we regularize the posterior of an efficient multi-view latent variable model by explicitly mapping the latent representations extracted from multiple data views to a random Fourier feature space where max-margin classification constraints are imposed. Assuming these random features are drawn from Dirichlet process Gaussian mixtures, we can adaptively learn shift-invariant kernels from data according to Bochners theorem.

In many real-world applications, data collected from different clients can vary significantly in distribution, leading to a phenomenon known as data heterogeneity. This heterogeneity poses several critical problems:\n\n1. **Model Drift**: As local models are trained on Non-IID data, they tend to diverge from a global model, resulting in poor generalization when the models are aggregated. This drift can severely impact the performance of the global model, as it may not effectively represent the underlying data distributions of all clients.\n\n2. **Communication Overhead**: The need for frequent communication between clients and the central server to synchronize model updates can lead to increased latency and bandwidth consumption. This is particularly problematic in scenarios where clients have intermittent connectivity or limited resources.\n\n3. **Privacy Concerns**: While FL aims to enhance privacy by keeping data local, the sharing of model updates can still expose sensitive information. This is especially true when clients' data distributions are highly variable, as it may inadvertently leak information about individual data points.\n\n4. **Personalization vs. Generalization**: Striking a balance between creating a model that generalizes well across all clients while also being personalized to individual client needs is a complex task. Existing methods often fail to adequately address this trade-off, leading to suboptimal performance for specific clients.\n\n5. **Robustness to Noisy Labels**: In many practical applications, especially those involving crowd-sourced data, the presence of noisy labels can further complicate the training process. This noise can lead to inaccurate model updates, exacerbating the issues of model drift and reducing overall model reliability.\n\nTo address these challenges, innovative approaches such as knowledge distillation combined with dynamic client clustering can be explored. These methods aim to enhance model personalization while maintaining privacy and reducing communication overhead, ultimately leading to more robust and effective federated learning systems.\n\n### References\n1. **Overcoming Forgetting in Federated Learning on Non-IID Data**: This paper discusses the adaptation of solutions for catastrophic forgetting in the context of federated learning, which is relevant to addressing model drift.\n   - [Read More](http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07796v1)\n\n2. **Medical Federated Model with Mixture of Personalized and Sharing Components**: This work proposes a personalized framework for federated learning that addresses the performance degradation due to heterogeneous data.\n   - [Read More](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14483v1)\n\n3. **FedMD: Heterogenous Federated Learning via Model Distillation**: This paper presents a framework that utilizes knowledge distillation to enable federated learning with heterogeneous models, which is crucial for addressing the personalization challenge.\n   - [Read More](http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03581v1)\n\nThis draft will serve as a concrete output for the team's deliverable and will help improve my contribution ratio in the next round.

Conventional federated learning architecture, inherited from the parameter server design, relies on highly centralized topologies and the assumption of large nodes-to-server bandwidths. However, in real-world federated learning scenarios the network capacities between nodes are highly uniformly distributed and smaller than that in a datacenter. It is of great challenges for conventional federated learning approaches to efficiently utilize network capacities between nodes. In this paper, we propose a model segment level decentralized federated learning to tackle this problem. In particular, we propose a segmented gossip approach, which not only makes full utilization of node-to-node bandwidth, but also has good training convergence.

Such setting is not realistic in mobile pervasive computing where data storage must be kept low and data characteristic can change dramatically. To account for this variability, a solution is to use the data regularly collected by the client to progressively adapt the received model.

This heterogeneity can lead to suboptimal model performance and convergence issues.\n\nRecent research has focused on various aspects of FL, including:\n\n1. **Adversarial Threats and Defense Mechanisms**: A survey by Hallaji et al. discusses the intersection of federated and transfer learning, highlighting vulnerabilities and potential defense mechanisms to enhance security in FL systems ([Federated and Transfer Learning: A Survey on Adversaries and Defense Mechanisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02337v1)).\n\n2. **Vertical Asynchronous Federated Learning**: Chen et al. propose a method that allows clients to run stochastic gradient algorithms independently, improving communication efficiency and privacy ([VAFL: a Method of Vertical Asynchronous Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06081v1)).\n\n3. **Central Server-Free Approaches**: He et al. introduce a central server-free federated learning algorithm suitable for social networks, addressing scenarios where a central server is not feasible ([Central Server Free Federated Learning over Single-sided Trust Social Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04956v2)).\n\n4. **Decentralized Federated Learning**: A segmented gossip approach is proposed to enhance communication efficiency and training convergence in decentralized settings ([Decentralized Federated Learning: A Segmented Gossip Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07782v1)).\n\n5. **Overcoming Non-IID Data Challenges**: Shoham et al. tackle the issue of local model drift in non-IID settings by adapting solutions from lifelong learning, demonstrating improved performance in image recognition tasks ([Overcoming Forgetting in Federated Learning on Non-IID Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07796v1)).\n\n#### Gaps in Current Research\nDespite the advancements, several gaps remain in the current research landscape:\n\n- **Personalization in Federated Learning**: While there are methods for model personalization, many existing approaches do not adequately address the trade-off between generalization and personalization, particularly in heterogeneous data environments.\n\n- **Communication Efficiency**: Many FL methods still rely on centralized architectures, which can be inefficient in real-world applications where clients may have intermittent connectivity.\n\n- **Robustness to Adversarial Attacks**: There is a need for more robust defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks that can compromise the integrity of federated learning systems.\n\n### Proposed Research Ideas\n\n1. **Personalized Federated Learning with Contrastive Learning**:\n   - **Objective**: Develop a personalized federated learning framework that leverages contrastive learning to enhance feature representation across heterogeneous clients.\n   - **Methodology**: Implement a contrastive loss function that encourages similar representations for similar data points while maintaining distinct representations for dissimilar points. This approach can help in better capturing the unique characteristics of local data distributions.\n\n2. **Data-Efficient Learning for Occluded Face Recognition**:\n   - **Objective**: Address the challenges of occluded face recognition in federated learning settings by proposing a data-efficient learning method that utilizes synthetic data generation.\n   - **Methodology**: Combine generative models with federated learning to create synthetic occluded face images that can be used to augment local datasets. This can improve model robustness and accuracy in recognizing faces under occlusion.\n\n### Summary of Collective Ideas\nThe proposed research ideas aim to bridge the gaps identified in the literature review by focusing on personalization and data efficiency in federated learning. By leveraging contrastive learning and synthetic data generation, these ideas seek to enhance model performance in heterogeneous environments while addressing privacy concerns.\n\n### Next Steps\n- **Draft the '5q' Format**: I will now formulate the research proposal in the '5q' format, addressing the specific problem, its importance, challenges, gaps in previous research, and proposed methodology. \n\n#### Draft of the '5q' Format\n\n1. **Question 1**: What is the specific problem you aim to address?\n   - The problem is the challenge of achieving effective personalization in federated learning, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous data distributions among clients.\n\n2. **Question 2**: Why is it important to solve this problem?\n   - Solving this problem is crucial for improving the accuracy and robustness of federated learning models, especially in applications where data privacy is paramount, such as healthcare and finance.\n\n3. **Question 3**: What are the challenges involved in addressing this problem?\n   - The main challenges include managing statistical heterogeneity, ensuring efficient communication among clients, and developing robust models that can generalize well across diverse data distributions.\n\n4. **Question 4**: What gaps exist in previous research?\n   - Previous research has not sufficiently addressed the trade-off between generalization and personalization in federated learning, nor has it explored the potential of contrastive learning in this context.\n\n5. **Question 5**: What is your proposed methodology?\n   - The proposed methodology involves developing a personalized federated learning framework that incorporates contrastive learning techniques and synthetic data generation to enhance model performance and robustness.\n\nI will now share this draft with the team for feedback and further integration into our collective proposal.\n"}, {"agent4": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"paper_abstracts\": [\"One of the most difficult challenges in cybersecurity is eliminating Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.

This research investigates the use of Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) techniques to improve DDoS attack detection when data is imbalanced and partially labeled. In this process, 13 state-of-the-art SSL algorithms are evaluated for detecting DDoS attacks in several scenarios. We evaluate their practical efficacy and shortcomings, including the extent to which they work in extreme environments.

Current DFL architectures ensure the trustworthiness of the aggregator node upon selection. However, most of these studies overlook the possibility that the aggregating node may turn rogue and act maliciously after being nominated. To address this problem, this paper proposes a DFL structure, called TrustChain, that scores the aggregators before selection based on their past behavior and additionally audits them after the aggregation. To do this, the statistical independence between the client updates and the aggregated model is continuously monitored using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). The proposed method relies on several principles, including blockchain, anomaly detection, and concept drift analysis. The designed structure is evaluated on several federated datasets and attack scenarios with different numbers of Byzantine nodes.\", \"In response to the evolving aspect of emerging phishing threats, this paper presents a comprehensive study of machine learning techniques used for detecting phishing attacks.

To ensure the applicability of our findings in real-life scenarios, simulations are performed using two comprehensive real-world datasets.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             Introduction\nFederated learning (FL) can leverage distributed user data\nwhile preserving privacy by iteratively downloading mod-\nels, training models locally on the clients, uploading models,\nand aggregating models on the server. A key challenge in\nFL is statistical heterogeneity, e.g., the not independent and\nidentically distributed (Non-IID) and unbalanced data across\nclients. This kind of data makes it hard to obtain a global\nmodel that generalizes to each client (McMahan et al. 2017;\nReisizadeh et al. 2020; T Dinh, Tran, and Nguyen 2020).\nPersonalized FL (pFL) Related Work\nTraditional Federated Learning\nThe widely known traditional FL method FedAvg (McMa-\nhan et al. 2017) learns a single global model for all clientsby aggregating their local models. However, it often suffers\nin statistically heterogeneous settings, e.g., FL with Non-\nIID and unbalanced data (Kairouz et al. 2019; Zhao et al.\n2018). To address this issue, FedProx (Li et al. 2020) im-\nproves the stability of the FL process through a proximal\nterm. To counteract the bias introduced by the Non-IID data,\nFA VOR (Wang et al. 2020a) selects a subset of clients based\non deep Q-learning (Van Hasselt, Guez, and Silver 2016)\nat each iteration. By generating the global model layer-\nwise, FedMA (Wang et al. 2020b) can adapt to statistical\nheterogeneity with the matched averaging approach. How-\never, with statistical heterogeneity in FL, it is hard to ob-\ntain a single global model which generalizes well to each\nclient (Kairouz et al. 2019; Huang et al. 2021; T Dinh, Tran,\nand Nguyen 2020).\nPersonalized Federated Learning\nRecently, personalization has attracted much attention for\ntackling statistical heterogeneity in FL (Kairouz et al. 2019).\nWe consider the following three categories of pFL Methods with Dynamic Bound of Learning Rate.\nInICLR .\nMcMahan, B.; Moore, E.; Ramage, D.; Hampson, S.; and\ny Arcas, B.

A key challenge in\nFL is statistical heterogeneity, e.g., the not independent and\nidentically distributed (Non-IID) and unbalanced data across\nclients. This kind of data makes it hard to obtain a global\nmodel that generalizes to each client (McMahan et al. 2017;\nReisizadeh et al. 2020; T Dinh, Tran, and Nguyen 2020).\nPersonalized FL (pFL) Related Work\nTraditional Federated Learning\nThe widely known traditional FL method FedAvg (McMa-\nhan et al. 2017) learns a single global model for all clientsby aggregating their local models. However, it often suffers\nin statistically heterogeneous settings, e.g., FL with Non-\nIID and unbalanced data (Kairouz et al. 2019; Zhao et al.\n2018). To address this issue, FedProx (Li et al. 2020) im-\nproves the stability of the FL process through a proximal\nterm. To counteract the bias introduced by the Non-IID data,\nFA VOR (Wang et al. 2020a) selects a subset of clients based\non deep Q-learning (Van Hasselt, Guez, and Silver 2016)\nat each iteration. By generating the global model layer-\nwise, FedMA (Wang et al. 2020b) can adapt to statistical\nheterogeneity with the matched averaging approach. How-\never, with statistical heterogeneity in FL, it is hard to ob-\ntain a single global model which generalizes well to each\nclient (Kairouz et al. 2019; Huang et al. 2021; T Dinh, Tran,\nand Nguyen 2020).\nPersonalized Federated Learning\nRecently, personalization has attracted much attention for\ntackling statistical heterogeneity in FL (Kairouz et al. 2019).\nWe consider the following three categories of pFL Methods with Dynamic Bound of Learning Rate.\nInICLR .\nMcMahan, B.; Moore, E.; Ramage, D.; Hampson, S.; and\ny Arcas, B.

Recently, federated learning provides a secure and trustable alternative to collaboratively train model without any exchange of medical data among multiple institutes. Therefore, it has draw much attention due to its natural merit on privacy protection. However, when heterogenous medical data exists between different hospitals, federated learning usually has to face with degradation of performance. In the paper, we propose a new personalized framework of federated learning to handle the problem. It successfully yields personalized models based on awareness of similarity between local data, and achieves better tradeoff between generalization and personalization than existing methods. After that, we further design a differentially sparse regularizer to improve communication efficiency during procedure of model training. Additionally, we propose an effective method to reduce the computational cost, which improves computation efficiency significantly. Furthermore, we collect 5 real medical datasets, including 2 public medical image datasets and 3 private multi-center clinical diagnosis datasets, and evaluate its performance by conducting nodule classification, tumor segmentation, and clinical risk prediction tasks. Comparing with 13 existing related methods, the proposed method successfully achieves the best model performance, and meanwhile up to 60% improvement of communication efficiency.

In particular, we propose a segmented gossip approach, which not only makes full utilization of node-to-node bandwidth, but also has good training convergence. The experimental results show that even the training time can be highly reduced as compared to centralized federated learning.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07782v1\", \"timestamp\": 1566382903, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"e11f05cf-fc81-4425-b623-a643849e9596\", \"authors\": [\"Neta Shoham\", \"Tomer Avidor\", \"Aviv Keren\", \"Nadav Israel\", \"Daniel Benditkis\", \"Liron Mor-Yosef\", \"Itai Zeitak\"], \"title\": \"Overcoming Forgetting in Federated Learning on Non-IID Data\", \"abstract\": \"We tackle the problem of Federated Learning in the non i.i.d. case, in which local models drift apart, inhibiting learning.

Recent advancements have highlighted the integration of transfer learning into FL, addressing fundamental constraints related to security and efficiency. For instance, Hallaji et al. (2022) provide a comprehensive survey on adversaries and defense mechanisms in federated and transfer learning, emphasizing the need for robust security measures to protect privacy and enhance performance.\n\nIn the context of personalized federated learning (pFL), innovative methods such as the Vertical Asynchronous Federated Learning (VAFL) proposed by Chen et al. (2020) allow clients to run stochastic gradient algorithms independently, thus improving communication efficiency and ensuring data privacy. This method is particularly beneficial in scenarios with intermittent connectivity among clients.\n\nMoreover, the challenge of non-IID data in federated learning has been addressed by Shoham et al. (2019), who propose a penalty term in the loss function to mitigate model drift and enhance convergence towards a shared optimum. This approach demonstrates significant improvements in image recognition tasks, showcasing the potential for pFL to adapt to diverse data distributions while maintaining model accuracy.\n\n### Key Challenges and Areas for Innovation\n1. **Security Vulnerabilities**: As highlighted in the survey by Hallaji et al., the intersection of federated and transfer learning presents unique security challenges that need to be addressed to ensure privacy and model integrity.\n2. **Communication Efficiency**: The VAFL method illustrates the importance of developing asynchronous methods that can operate effectively in environments with limited connectivity, which is crucial for real-world applications.\n3. **Handling Non-IID Data**: The adaptation of lifelong learning techniques to federated learning, as proposed by Shoham et al., opens avenues for further research into methods that can effectively manage data heterogeneity across clients.\n\n### Proposed Research Idea\n**Title**: Enhancing Personalized Federated Learning through Differentially Private Generative Models\n\n**Research Direction**: This research aims to leverage the strengths of generative models with differential privacy to enhance personalized federated learning. By integrating techniques such as stochastic adversarial distillation, we can improve the quality of generated data while ensuring privacy.

Recent advancements have highlighted the integration of transfer learning into FL, addressing fundamental constraints related to security and efficiency. For instance, Hallaji et al. (2022) provide a comprehensive survey on adversaries and defense mechanisms in federated and transfer learning, emphasizing the need for robust security measures to protect privacy and enhance performance.\n\nIn the context of personalized federated learning (pFL), innovative methods such as the Vertical Asynchronous Federated Learning (VAFL) proposed by Chen et al. (2020) allow clients to run stochastic gradient algorithms independently, thus improving communication efficiency and ensuring data privacy. This method is particularly beneficial in scenarios with intermittent connectivity among clients.\n\nMoreover, the challenge of non-IID data in federated learning has been addressed by Shoham et al. (2019), who propose a penalty term in the loss function to mitigate model drift and enhance convergence towards a shared optimum. This approach demonstrates significant improvements in image recognition tasks, showcasing the potential for pFL to adapt to diverse data distributions while maintaining model accuracy.\n\n### Key Challenges and Areas for Innovation\n1. **Security Vulnerabilities**: As highlighted in the survey by Hallaji et al., the intersection of federated and transfer learning presents unique security challenges that need to be addressed to ensure privacy and model integrity.\n2. **Communication Efficiency**: The VAFL method illustrates the importance of developing asynchronous methods that can operate effectively in environments with limited connectivity, which is crucial for real-world applications.\n3. **Handling Non-IID Data**: The adaptation of lifelong learning techniques to federated learning, as proposed by Shoham et al., opens avenues for further research into methods that can effectively manage data heterogeneity across clients.\n\n### Proposed Research Idea\n**Title**: Enhancing Personalized Federated Learning through Differentially Private Generative Models\n\n**Research Direction**: This research aims to leverage the strengths of generative models with differential privacy to enhance personalized federated learning. By integrating techniques such as stochastic adversarial distillation, we can improve the quality of generated data while ensuring privacy. This approach will address the challenges of data scarcity and privacy in pFL, allowing for more robust model training across heterogeneous data sources.\n\n### Summary Document\nThe summary document will encapsulate the collective ideas and insights from the team, synthesizing contributions from the literature review and the proposed research direction.

Recent advancements have highlighted the integration of transfer learning into FL, addressing fundamental constraints related to security and efficiency. For instance, Hallaji et al. (2022) provide a comprehensive survey on adversaries and defense mechanisms in federated and transfer learning, emphasizing the need for robust security measures to protect privacy and enhance performance.\n\nIn the context of personalized federated learning (pFL), innovative methods such as the Vertical Asynchronous Federated Learning (VAFL) proposed by Chen et al. (2020) allow clients to run stochastic gradient algorithms independently, thus improving communication efficiency and ensuring data privacy. This method is particularly beneficial in scenarios with intermittent connectivity among clients.\n\nMoreover, the challenge of non-IID data in federated learning has been addressed by Shoham et al. (2019), who propose a penalty term in the loss function to mitigate model drift and enhance convergence towards a shared optimum. This approach demonstrates significant improvements in image recognition tasks, showcasing the potential for pFL to adapt to diverse data distributions while maintaining model accuracy.\n\n### Key Challenges and Areas for Innovation\n1. **Security Vulnerabilities**: As highlighted in the survey by Hallaji et al., the intersection of federated and transfer learning presents unique security challenges that need to be addressed to ensure privacy and model integrity.\n2. **Communication Efficiency**: The VAFL method illustrates the importance of developing asynchronous methods that can operate effectively in environments with limited connectivity, which is crucial for real-world applications.\n3. **Handling Non-IID Data**: The adaptation of lifelong learning techniques to federated learning, as proposed by Shoham et al., opens avenues for further research into methods that can effectively manage data heterogeneity across clients.\n\n### Proposed Research Idea\n**Title**: Enhancing Personalized Federated Learning through Differentially Private Generative Models\n\n**Research Direction**: This research aims to leverage the strengths of generative models with differential privacy to enhance personalized federated learning. By integrating techniques such as stochastic adversarial distillation, we can improve the quality of generated data while ensuring privacy. This approach will address the challenges of data scarcity and privacy in pFL, allowing for more robust model training across heterogeneous data sources.\n\n### Summary Document\nThe summary document will encapsulate the collective ideas and insights from the team, synthesizing contributions from the literature review and the proposed research direction.

Recent advancements have highlighted the integration of transfer learning into FL, addressing fundamental constraints related to security and efficiency. For instance, Hallaji et al. (2022) provide a comprehensive survey on adversaries and defense mechanisms in federated and transfer learning, emphasizing the need for robust security measures to protect privacy and enhance performance.\n\nIn the context of personalized federated learning (pFL), innovative methods such as the Vertical Asynchronous Federated Learning (VAFL) proposed by Chen et al. (2020) allow clients to run stochastic gradient algorithms independently, thus improving communication efficiency and ensuring data privacy. This method is particularly beneficial in scenarios with intermittent connectivity among clients.\n\nMoreover, the challenge of non-IID data in federated learning has been addressed by Shoham et al.

This kind of data makes it hard to obtain a global\nmodel that generalizes to each client (McMahan et al. 2017;\nReisizadeh et al. 2020; T Dinh, Tran, and Nguyen 2020).\nPersonalized FL (pFL) Related Work\nTraditional Federated Learning\nThe widely known traditional FL method FedAvg (McMa-\nhan et al. 2017) learns a single global model for all clientsby aggregating their local models. However, it often suffers\nin statistically heterogeneous settings, e.g., FL with Non-\nIID and unbalanced data (Kairouz et al. 2019; Zhao et al.\n2018). To address this issue, FedProx (Li et al. 2020) im-\nproves the stability of the FL process through a proximal\nterm. To counteract the bias introduced by the Non-IID data,\nFA VOR (Wang et al. 2020a) selects a subset of clients based\non deep Q-learning (Van Hasselt, Guez, and Silver 2016)\nat each iteration. By generating the global model layer-\nwise, FedMA (Wang et al. 2020b) can adapt to statistical\nheterogeneity with the matched averaging approach. How-\never, with statistical heterogeneity in FL, it is hard to ob-\ntain a single global model which generalizes well to each\nclient (Kairouz et al. 2019; Huang et al. 2021; T Dinh, Tran,\nand Nguyen 2020).\nPersonalized Federated Learning\nRecently, personalization has attracted much attention for\ntackling statistical heterogeneity in FL (Kairouz et al. 2019).\nWe consider the following three categories of pFL Methods with Dynamic Bound of Learning Rate.\nInICLR .\nMcMahan, B.; Moore, E.; Ramage, D.; Hampson, S.; and\ny Arcas, B.

Recently, federated learning provides a secure and trustable alternative to collaboratively train model without any exchange of medical data among multiple institutes. Therefore, it has draw much attention due to its natural merit on privacy protection. However, when heterogenous medical data exists between different hospitals, federated learning usually has to face with degradation of performance. In the paper, we propose a new personalized framework of federated learning to handle the problem. It successfully yields personalized models based on awareness of similarity between local data, and achieves better tradeoff between generalization and personalization than existing methods. After that, we further design a differentially sparse regularizer to improve communication efficiency during procedure of model training. Additionally, we propose an effective method to reduce the computational cost, which improves computation efficiency significantly. Furthermore, we collect 5 real medical datasets, including 2 public medical image datasets and 3 private multi-center clinical diagnosis datasets, and evaluate its performance by conducting nodule classification, tumor segmentation, and clinical risk prediction tasks. Comparing with 13 existing related methods, the proposed method successfully achieves the best model performance, and meanwhile up to 60% improvement of communication efficiency.

Knowledge distillation is a technique for transferring knowledge of deep or ensemble models with many parameters (teacher model) to smaller shallow models (student model).

Its success is generally attributed to the privileged information on similarities among categories provided by the teacher model, and in this sense, only strong teacher models are deployed to teach weaker students in practice. In this work, we challenge this common belief by following experimental observations: 1) beyond the acknowledgment that the teacher can improve the student, the student can also enhance the teacher significantly by reversing the KD procedure; 2) a poorly-trained teacher with much lower accuracy than the student can still improve the latter significantly. To explain these observations, we provide a theoretical analysis of the relationships between KD and label smoothing regularization. We prove that 1) KD is a type of learned label smoothing regularization and 2) label smoothing regularization provides a virtual teacher model for KD. From these results, we argue that the success of KD is not fully due to the similarity information between categories from teachers, but also to the regularization of soft targets, which is equally or even more important.   Based on these analyses, we further propose a novel Teacher-free Knowledge Distillation (Tf-KD) framework, where a student model learns from itself or manuallydesigned regularization distribution. The Tf-KD achieves comparable performance with normal KD from a superior teacher, which is well applied when a stronger teacher model is unavailable. Meanwhile, Tf-KD is generic and can be directly deployed for training deep neural networks. Without any extra computation cost, Tf-KD achieves up to 0.65\\\\% improvement on ImageNet over well-established baseline models, which is superior to label smoothing regularization.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11723v3\", \"timestamp\": 1569440023, \"domain\": \"cs.CV\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"7b1616fe-8835-4a2b-be35-653dfa326bec\", \"authors\": [\"Chuanguang Yang\", \"Xinqiang Yu\", \"Zhulin An\", \"Yongjun Xu\"], \"title\": \"Categories of Response-Based, Feature-Based, and Relation-Based Knowledge Distillation\", \"abstract\": \"Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable performance for artificial intelligence tasks.

This can be achieved through techniques such as local fine-tuning and knowledge distillation, ensuring that each client\u2019s model is tailored to its specific data distribution.\n\n3. **Handling Non-IID Data**: The proposed method will incorporate strategies to mitigate the effects of Non-IID data, such as:\n   - **Penalty Terms**: Inspired by the work on catastrophic forgetting, we can introduce penalty terms in the loss function to encourage local models to converge towards a shared optimum, as suggested in the paper \"Overcoming Forgetting in Federated Learning on Non-IID Data.\"\n   - **Communication Efficiency**: We will explore methods to improve communication efficiency during model updates, potentially using techniques from the paper \"VAFL: a Method of Vertical Asynchronous Federated Learning.\"\n\n#### Methodology\n- **Data Collection**: Utilize diverse datasets, including medical imaging and other domains, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.\n- **Model Training**: Implement a federated learning setup where clients can train their models locally and share updates with a central server or peer clients.\n- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, communication cost, and convergence speed.\n\n### Draft for Question 1: What is the problem?\nThe primary challenge in federated learning arises from the Non-IID nature of data across clients, leading to local models that diverge and inhibit effective learning. This divergence can result in suboptimal global models that fail to generalize well across the entire client population. Existing methods, such as FedAvg and FedProx, attempt to address these issues but often fall short in scenarios with significant data heterogeneity. Our proposed hybrid multi-view learning approach aims to enhance personalization while maintaining robust performance, ultimately addressing the limitations of current federated learning frameworks.\n\n### Request for Feedback\nI invite feedback on this proposed research direction and the draft for Question 1. Additionally, I am open to suggestions on how to further refine the methodology or integrate concepts from other agents' work, particularly in relation to privacy mechanisms and contrastive learning.\n"}, {"agent5": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"papers\": [{\"pk\": \"54670bc4-3024-4506-b6dc-e8d894787611\", \"authors\": [\"Ehsan Hallaji\", \"Roozbeh Razavi-Far\", \"Mehrdad Saif\"], \"title\": \"Federated and Transfer Learning: A Survey on Adversaries and Defense Mechanisms\", \"abstract\": \"The advent of federated learning has facilitated large-scale data exchange amongst machine learning models while maintaining privacy.

Traditional federated learning methods often struggle to maintain privacy while ensuring model performance, particularly when dealing with heterogeneous data across clients. The challenge lies in effectively integrating differential privacy techniques into pFL frameworks to safeguard user data without compromising the quality of the learned models.\n\n#### [Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?\nAddressing privacy concerns in pFL is crucial for fostering trust among users and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations. As machine learning applications increasingly rely on sensitive data, enhancing privacy mechanisms can lead to broader adoption of federated learning in various domains, including healthcare, finance, and social networks. Solving this problem not only contributes to the academic discourse on privacy-preserving machine learning but also has practical implications for real-world applications where data security is paramount.\n\n#### [Question 3] - Why is it hard?\nIntegrating differential privacy into pFL frameworks presents several challenges:\n1. **Trade-off between Privacy and Utility**: Ensuring strong privacy guarantees often leads to a degradation in model performance, making it difficult to strike a balance.\n2. **Statistical Heterogeneity**: Clients may have non-IID data distributions, complicating the application of differential privacy techniques that typically assume IID data.\n3. **Communication Overhead**: Implementing differential privacy can increase the amount of data exchanged between clients and the server, leading to higher communication costs and potential delays in model convergence.\n\n#### [Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?\nPrevious research has primarily focused on either federated learning or differential privacy in isolation, with limited efforts to combine the two effectively. Existing methods often overlook the complexities introduced by heterogeneous data and the need for robust privacy mechanisms that do not compromise model performance. Additionally, the lack of comprehensive frameworks that address these challenges has hindered progress in this area.\n\n#### [Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?\n1. **Literature Review**: Conduct a thorough review of existing pFL frameworks and their privacy mechanisms, identifying gaps and opportunities for improvement.\n2. **Model Development**: Design a novel pFL framework that incorporates differential privacy techniques, such as stochastic adversarial distillation, to enhance data security while maintaining model performance.\n3. **Experimental Validation**: Implement the proposed framework on diverse datasets, comparing its performance against traditional federated learning methods in terms of accuracy and privacy guarantees.\n4. **Analysis of Results**: Evaluate the trade-offs between privacy and model performance, providing insights into the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its applicability in real-world scenarios.\n\n### Next Steps\n- **Engage in Team Communication**: Share this drafted '5q' proposal with the team to gather feedback and refine the idea further.\n- **Incorporate Feedback**: Revise the proposal based on team input, ensuring clarity and robustness.\n- **Prepare for Team Discussion**: Be ready to discuss the proposal in the next team meeting, explaining the rationale behind the research direction and how it addresses identified gaps in the literature.\n- **Continue Literature Review**: Explore additional literature that may support the proposal or provide further insights into the integration of differential privacy in federated learning.\n\nBy following this structured approach, I aim to enhance my personal contribution and foster better collaboration within the team, ultimately leading to a more robust research proposal.\n"}, {"agent3": "Result from the model:### Proposed Research Direction\n**Integration of Contrastive Learning in Personalized Federated Learning (pFL) for Non-IID Data**\n\n### Draft Section of the '5q' Format\n\n1. **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n   - The primary challenge in personalized federated learning (pFL) arises from the non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) nature of data across clients.

Here are the key components of the proposal:\n\n### '5q' Proposal: Enhancing Privacy in Personalized Federated Learning through Differential Privacy Mechanisms\n\n#### [Question 1] - What is the problem?\nThe rapid adoption of personalized federated learning (pFL) has raised significant concerns regarding data privacy, especially in scenarios where sensitive information is involved. Traditional federated learning methods often struggle to maintain privacy while ensuring model performance, particularly when dealing with heterogeneous data across clients. The challenge lies in effectively integrating differential privacy techniques into pFL frameworks to safeguard user data without compromising the quality of the learned models.\n\n#### [Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?\nAddressing privacy concerns in pFL is crucial for fostering trust among users and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations. As machine learning applications increasingly rely on sensitive data, enhancing privacy mechanisms can lead to broader adoption of federated learning in various domains, including healthcare, finance, and social networks. Solving this problem not only contributes to the academic discourse on privacy-preserving machine learning but also has practical implications for real-world applications where data security is paramount.\n\n#### [Question 3] - Why is it hard?\nIntegrating differential privacy into pFL frameworks presents several challenges:\n1. **Trade-off between Privacy and Utility**: Ensuring strong privacy guarantees often leads to a degradation in model performance, making it difficult to strike a balance.\n2. **Statistical Heterogeneity**: Clients may have non-IID data distributions, complicating the application of differential privacy techniques that typically assume IID data.\n3. **Communication Overhead**: Implementing differential privacy can increase the amount of data exchanged between clients and the server, leading to higher communication costs and potential delays in model convergence.\n\n#### [Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?\nPrevious research has primarily focused on either federated learning or differential privacy in isolation, with limited efforts to combine the two effectively. Existing methods often overlook the complexities introduced by heterogeneous data and the need for robust privacy mechanisms that do not compromise model performance. Additionally, the lack of comprehensive frameworks that address these challenges has hindered progress in this area.\n\n#### [Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?\n1. **Literature Review**: Conduct a thorough review of existing pFL frameworks and their privacy mechanisms, identifying gaps and opportunities for improvement.\n2. **Model Development**: Design a novel pFL framework that incorporates differential privacy techniques, such as stochastic adversarial distillation, to enhance data security while maintaining model performance.\n3. **Experimental Validation**: Implement the proposed framework on diverse datasets, comparing its performance against traditional federated learning methods in terms of accuracy and privacy guarantees.\n4. **Analysis of Results**: Evaluate the trade-offs between privacy and model performance, providing insights into the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its applicability in real-world scenarios.\n\n### Next Steps\n- **Engage in Team Communication**: I would appreciate your feedback on this proposal. Specifically, what are your thoughts on the proposed methodology? Are there any additional privacy mechanisms we should consider?\n- **Incorporate Feedback**: I will revise the proposal based on your input, ensuring clarity and robustness.\n- **Prepare for Team Discussion**: I am ready to discuss the proposal in our next team meeting, explaining the rationale behind the research direction and how it addresses identified gaps in the literature.\n- **Continue Literature Review**: I will explore additional literature that may support the proposal or provide further insights into the integration of differential privacy in federated learning.\n\nThank you for your collaboration!\n\nBest,  \nAgent2\n\n---\n\nThis message encourages team members to engage with the proposal and provide specific feedback, fostering collaboration and improving the overall quality of the research direction.\n"}, {"agent3": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"paper_abstracts\": [\"Polydatin, resveratrol-3-O-\\u03b2-glucoside, possesses various biological activities.

Traditional models struggle to maintain accuracy when faced with low-resolution images, which is critical in real-world applications where data privacy is paramount.\n\n#### Question 2: Why is this problem important?\nSolving the low-resolution face recognition problem is vital for enhancing security and privacy in sensitive applications, such as surveillance and personal identification. Improving model performance in these scenarios can lead to more reliable systems that respect user privacy while providing accurate results.\n\n#### Question 3: Why is it hard?\nAddressing low-resolution face recognition is challenging due to the inherent loss of detail in images, which complicates feature extraction and recognition tasks. Additionally, federated learning introduces complexities such as non-IID data distributions and communication constraints, making it difficult to achieve robust model performance across diverse client data.\n\n#### Question 4: What are the gaps in previous research?\nPrevious research has primarily focused on high-resolution images, with limited exploration of techniques that effectively transfer knowledge from high-resolution to low-resolution contexts. Furthermore, existing federated learning approaches often overlook the unique challenges posed by low-resolution data, leading to suboptimal performance.\n\n#### Question 5: What is your proposed methodology?\nThe proposed methodology involves developing an adaptable instance-relation distillation method that leverages knowledge distillation techniques to enhance model performance in low-resolution face recognition tasks.

Here are the key components of the proposal:\n\n### '5q' Proposal: Enhancing Privacy in Personalized Federated Learning through Differential Privacy Mechanisms\n\n#### [Question 1] - What is the problem?\nThe rapid adoption of personalized federated learning (pFL) has raised significant concerns regarding data privacy, especially in scenarios where sensitive information is involved. Traditional federated learning methods often struggle to maintain privacy while ensuring model performance, particularly when dealing with heterogeneous data across clients. The challenge lies in effectively integrating differential privacy techniques into pFL frameworks to safeguard user data without compromising the quality of the learned models.\n\n#### [Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?\nAddressing privacy concerns in pFL is crucial for fostering trust among users and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations. As machine learning applications increasingly rely on sensitive data, enhancing privacy mechanisms can lead to broader adoption of federated learning in various domains, including healthcare, finance, and social networks. Solving this problem not only contributes to the academic discourse on privacy-preserving machine learning but also has practical implications for real-world applications where data security is paramount.\n\n#### [Question 3] - Why is it hard?\nIntegrating differential privacy into pFL frameworks presents several challenges:\n1. **Trade-off between Privacy and Utility**: Ensuring strong privacy guarantees often leads to a degradation in model performance, making it difficult to strike a balance.\n2. **Statistical Heterogeneity**: Clients may have non-IID data distributions, complicating the application of differential privacy techniques that typically assume IID data.\n3. **Communication Overhead**: Implementing differential privacy can increase the amount of data exchanged between clients and the server, leading to higher communication costs and potential delays in model convergence.\n\n#### [Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?\nPrevious research has primarily focused on either federated learning or differential privacy in isolation, with limited efforts to combine the two effectively. Existing methods often overlook the complexities introduced by heterogeneous data and the need for robust privacy mechanisms that do not compromise model performance. Additionally, the lack of comprehensive frameworks that address these challenges has hindered progress in this area.\n\n#### [Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?\n1. **Literature Review**: Conduct a thorough review of existing pFL frameworks and their privacy mechanisms, identifying gaps and opportunities for improvement.\n2. **Model Development**: Design a novel pFL framework that incorporates differential privacy techniques, such as stochastic adversarial distillation, to enhance data security while maintaining model performance.\n3. **Experimental Validation**: Implement the proposed framework on diverse datasets, comparing its performance against traditional federated learning methods in terms of accuracy and privacy guarantees.\n4. **Analysis of Results**: Evaluate the trade-offs between privacy and model performance, providing insights into the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its applicability in real-world scenarios.\n\n### Next Steps\n- **Engage in Team Communication**: I would appreciate your feedback on this proposal. Specifically, what are your thoughts on the proposed methodology? Are there any additional privacy mechanisms we should consider?\n- **Incorporate Feedback**: I will revise the proposal based on your input, ensuring clarity and robustness.\n- **Prepare for Team Discussion**: I am ready to discuss the proposal in our next team meeting, explaining the rationale behind the research direction and how it addresses identified gaps in the literature.\n- **Continue Literature Review**: I will explore additional literature that may support the proposal or provide further insights into the integration of differential privacy in federated learning.\n\nThank you for your collaboration!\n\nBest,  \nAgent2\n\n---\n\nThis message encourages team members to engage with the proposal and provide specific feedback, fostering collaboration and improving the overall quality of the research direction.\n"}, {"agent3": "Result from the model:### Proposed Research Direction\n**Integration of Contrastive Learning in Personalized Federated Learning (pFL) for Non-IID Data**\n\n### Draft Section of the '5q' Format\n\n1. **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n   - The primary challenge in personalized federated learning (pFL) arises from the non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) nature of data across clients. This leads to local models that diverge significantly, making it difficult to achieve a consensus model that performs well across all clients. Current methods often fail to address the unique data distributions of individual clients, resulting in suboptimal performance.\n\n2. **[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n   - Improving pFL methods is crucial for applications in sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance, where data privacy is paramount. By enhancing model performance on non-IID data, we can ensure that federated learning systems are more effective and reliable, ultimately leading to better decision-making and outcomes in real-world applications.\n\n3. **[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n   - Integrating contrastive learning into pFL presents several complexities, including ensuring model convergence across diverse data distributions and managing communication overhead between clients. Additionally, the need to maintain privacy while improving feature representation adds another layer of difficulty.\n\n4. **[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n   - Existing research has primarily focused on centralized federated learning approaches or has not adequately addressed the unique challenges posed by non-IID data in pFL. There is a lack of emphasis on data-efficient methods that leverage contrastive learning to improve model personalization, which this proposal aims to address.\n\n5. **[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n   - The proposed methodology will involve:\n     - Utilizing contrastive learning techniques to enhance feature representation in local models.\n     - Implementing a decentralized training framework that allows clients to share model updates without compromising data privacy.\n     - Evaluating the approach on healthcare datasets to assess improvements in accuracy and communication efficiency.\n     - Metrics for evaluation will include model accuracy, convergence rates, and communication costs.\n\n### Engagement with Team Output\n- I will review the team's summary from the previous round and provide specific feedback on the proposed research ideas.

To address this, I propose a hybrid approach that integrates multi-view learning techniques with personalized federated learning. This approach aims to enhance model personalization while maintaining robust performance across heterogeneous data distributions.\n\n#### Key Components\n1. **Multi-View Learning**: Leveraging multiple views of the same data to create a more comprehensive representation of the underlying patterns.\n2. **Personalized Federated Learning Framework**: Developing a framework that adapts global models to individual client data characteristics through local fine-tuning and knowledge distillation.\n3. **Handling Non-IID Data**: Incorporating strategies such as penalty terms to encourage local models to converge towards a shared optimum and exploring methods to improve communication efficiency during model updates.\n\n#### Methodology\n- **Data Collection**: Utilize diverse datasets, including medical imaging, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.\n- **Model Training**: Implement a federated learning setup where clients can train their models locally and share updates.\n- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, communication cost, and convergence speed.\n\n### Draft for Question 1: What is the problem?\nThe primary challenge in federated learning arises from the Non-IID nature of data across clients, leading to local models that diverge and inhibit effective learning.

Here are the key components of the proposal:\n\n### '5q' Proposal: Enhancing Privacy in Personalized Federated Learning through Differential Privacy Mechanisms\n\n#### [Question 1] - What is the problem?\nThe rapid adoption of personalized federated learning (pFL) has raised significant concerns regarding data privacy, especially in scenarios where sensitive information is involved. Traditional federated learning methods often struggle to maintain privacy while ensuring model performance, particularly when dealing with heterogeneous data across clients. The challenge lies in effectively integrating differential privacy techniques into pFL frameworks to safeguard user data without compromising the quality of the learned models.\n\n#### [Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?\nAddressing privacy concerns in pFL is crucial for fostering trust among users and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations. As machine learning applications increasingly rely on sensitive data, enhancing privacy mechanisms can lead to broader adoption of federated learning in various domains, including healthcare, finance, and social networks. Solving this problem not only contributes to the academic discourse on privacy-preserving machine learning but also has practical implications for real-world applications where data security is paramount.\n\n#### [Question 3] - Why is it hard?\nIntegrating differential privacy into pFL frameworks presents several challenges:\n1. **Trade-off between Privacy and Utility**: Ensuring strong privacy guarantees often leads to a degradation in model performance, making it difficult to strike a balance.\n2. **Statistical Heterogeneity**: Clients may have non-IID data distributions, complicating the application of differential privacy techniques that typically assume IID data.\n3. **Communication Overhead**: Implementing differential privacy can increase the amount of data exchanged between clients and the server, leading to higher communication costs and potential delays in model convergence.\n\n#### [Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?\nPrevious research has primarily focused on either federated learning or differential privacy in isolation, with limited efforts to combine the two effectively. Existing methods often overlook the complexities introduced by heterogeneous data and the need for robust privacy mechanisms that do not compromise model performance. Additionally, the lack of comprehensive frameworks that address these challenges has hindered progress in this area.\n\n#### [Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?\n1. **Literature Review**: Conduct a thorough review of existing pFL frameworks and their privacy mechanisms, identifying gaps and opportunities for improvement.\n2. **Model Development**: Design a novel pFL framework that incorporates differential privacy techniques, such as stochastic adversarial distillation, to enhance data security while maintaining model performance.\n3. **Experimental Validation**: Implement the proposed framework on diverse datasets, comparing its performance against traditional federated learning methods in terms of accuracy and privacy guarantees.\n4. **Analysis of Results**: Evaluate the trade-offs between privacy and model performance, providing insights into the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its applicability in real-world scenarios.\n\n### Next Steps\n- **Engage in Team Communication**: I would appreciate your feedback on this proposal. Specifically, what are your thoughts on the proposed methodology? Are there any additional privacy mechanisms we should consider?\n- **Incorporate Feedback**: I will revise the proposal based on your input, ensuring clarity and robustness.\n- **Prepare for Team Discussion**: I am ready to discuss the proposal in our next team meeting, explaining the rationale behind the research direction and how it addresses identified gaps in the literature.\n- **Continue Literature Review**: I will explore additional literature that may support the proposal or provide further insights into the integration of differential privacy in federated learning.\n\nThank you for your collaboration!\n\nBest,  \nAgent2\n\n--- \n\nThis message encourages team members to engage with the proposal and provide specific feedback, fostering collaboration and improving the overall quality of the research direction.\n"}, {"agent4": "Result from the model:I have successfully posted the draft for Question 1 and the proposed research direction in the team channel. Here\u2019s a summary of the proposed research direction and the draft:\n\n### Proposed Research Direction: Hybrid Multi-View Learning for Personalized Federated Learning\n\n#### Overview\nThe challenge of Non-IID data in federated learning is significant, as it leads to local models that drift apart, inhibiting effective learning. To address this, I propose a hybrid approach that integrates multi-view learning techniques with personalized federated learning. This approach aims to enhance model personalization while maintaining robust performance across heterogeneous data distributions.\n\n#### Key Components\n1. **Multi-View Learning**: Leveraging multiple views of the same data to create a more comprehensive representation of the underlying patterns.\n2. **Personalized Federated Learning Framework**: Developing a framework that adapts global models to individual client data characteristics through local fine-tuning and knowledge distillation.\n3. **Handling Non-IID Data**: Incorporating strategies such as penalty terms to encourage local models to converge towards a shared optimum and exploring methods to improve communication efficiency during model updates.\n\n#### Methodology\n- **Data Collection**: Utilize diverse datasets, including medical imaging, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.\n- **Model Training**: Implement a federated learning setup where clients can train their models locally and share updates.\n- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, communication cost, and convergence speed.\n\n### Draft for Question 1: What is the problem?\nThe primary challenge in federated learning arises from the Non-IID nature of data across clients, leading to local models that diverge and inhibit effective learning. Existing methods, such as FedAvg and FedProx, often fall short in scenarios with significant data heterogeneity.\n\n### Request for Feedback\nI invite feedback on this proposed research direction and the draft for Question 1. Additionally, I am open to suggestions on how to further refine the methodology or integrate concepts from other agents' work, particularly in relation to privacy mechanisms and contrastive learning.\n\n---\n\nNext, I will engage in active discussion by asking specific questions to my teammates about the proposed hybrid multi-view learning approach and potential challenges.

Here are the key components of the proposal:\n\n### '5q' Proposal: Enhancing Privacy in Personalized Federated Learning through Differential Privacy Mechanisms\n\n#### [Question 1] - What is the problem?\nThe rapid adoption of personalized federated learning (pFL) has raised significant concerns regarding data privacy, especially in scenarios where sensitive information is involved. Traditional federated learning methods often struggle to maintain privacy while ensuring model performance, particularly when dealing with heterogeneous data across clients. The challenge lies in effectively integrating differential privacy techniques into pFL frameworks to safeguard user data without compromising the quality of the learned models.\n\n#### [Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?\nAddressing privacy concerns in pFL is crucial for fostering trust among users and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations. As machine learning applications increasingly rely on sensitive data, enhancing privacy mechanisms can lead to broader adoption of federated learning in various domains, including healthcare, finance, and social networks. Solving this problem not only contributes to the academic discourse on privacy-preserving machine learning but also has practical implications for real-world applications where data security is paramount.\n\n#### [Question 3] - Why is it hard?\nIntegrating differential privacy into pFL frameworks presents several challenges:\n1. **Trade-off between Privacy and Utility**: Ensuring strong privacy guarantees often leads to a degradation in model performance, making it difficult to strike a balance.\n2. **Statistical Heterogeneity**: Clients may have non-IID data distributions, complicating the application of differential privacy techniques that typically assume IID data.\n3. **Communication Overhead**: Implementing differential privacy can increase the amount of data exchanged between clients and the server, leading to higher communication costs and potential delays in model convergence.\n\n#### [Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?\nPrevious research has primarily focused on either federated learning or differential privacy in isolation, with limited efforts to combine the two effectively. Existing methods often overlook the complexities introduced by heterogeneous data and the need for robust privacy mechanisms that do not compromise model performance. Additionally, the lack of comprehensive frameworks that address these challenges has hindered progress in this area.\n\n#### [Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?\n1. **Literature Review**: Conduct a thorough review of existing pFL frameworks and their privacy mechanisms, identifying gaps and opportunities for improvement.\n2. **Model Development**: Design a novel pFL framework that incorporates differential privacy techniques, such as stochastic adversarial distillation, to enhance data security while maintaining model performance.\n3. **Experimental Validation**: Implement the proposed framework on diverse datasets, comparing its performance against traditional federated learning methods in terms of accuracy and privacy guarantees.\n4. **Analysis of Results**: Evaluate the trade-offs between privacy and model performance, providing insights into the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its applicability in real-world scenarios.\n\n### Next Steps\n- **Engage in Team Communication**: I would appreciate your feedback on this proposal. Specifically, what are your thoughts on the proposed methodology? Are there any additional privacy mechanisms we should consider?\n- **Incorporate Feedback**: I will revise the proposal based on your input, ensuring clarity and robustness.\n- **Prepare for Team Discussion**: I am ready to discuss the proposal in our next team meeting, explaining the rationale behind the research direction and how it addresses identified gaps in the literature.\n- **Continue Literature Review**: I will explore additional literature that may support the proposal or provide further insights into the integration of differential privacy in federated learning.\n\nThank you for your collaboration!\n\nBest,  \nAgent2\n\n--- \n\nThis message encourages team members to engage with the proposal and provide specific feedback, fostering collaboration and improving the overall quality of the research direction.\n"}, {"agent3": "Result from the model:### Proposed Research Direction\n**Integration of Contrastive Learning in Personalized Federated Learning (pFL) for Non-IID Data**\n\n### Draft Section of the '5q' Format\n\n1. **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n   - The primary challenge in personalized federated learning (pFL) arises from the non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) nature of data across clients. This leads to local models that diverge significantly, making it difficult to achieve a consensus model that performs well across all clients. Current methods often fail to address the unique data distributions of individual clients, resulting in suboptimal performance.\n\n2. **[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n   - Improving pFL methods is crucial for applications in sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance, where data privacy is paramount. By enhancing model performance on non-IID data, we can ensure that federated learning systems are more effective and reliable, ultimately leading to better decision-making and outcomes in real-world applications.\n\n3. **[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n   - Integrating contrastive learning into pFL presents several complexities, including ensuring model convergence across diverse data distributions and managing communication overhead between clients. Additionally, the need to maintain privacy while improving feature representation adds another layer of difficulty.\n\n4. **[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n   - Existing research has primarily focused on centralized federated learning approaches or has not adequately addressed the unique challenges posed by non-IID data in pFL. There is a lack of emphasis on data-efficient methods that leverage contrastive learning to improve model personalization, which this proposal aims to address.\n\n5. **[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n   - The proposed methodology will involve:\n     - Utilizing contrastive learning techniques to enhance feature representation in local models.\n     - Implementing a decentralized training framework that allows clients to share model updates without compromising data privacy.\n     - Evaluating the approach on healthcare datasets to assess improvements in accuracy and communication efficiency.\n     - Metrics for evaluation will include model accuracy, convergence rates, and communication costs.\n\n### Engagement with Team Output\n- I will review the team's summary from the previous round and provide specific feedback on the proposed research ideas.

To address this, I propose a hybrid approach that integrates multi-view learning techniques with personalized federated learning. This approach aims to enhance model personalization while maintaining robust performance across heterogeneous data distributions.\n\n#### Key Components\n1. **Multi-View Learning**: Leveraging multiple views of the same data to create a more comprehensive representation of the underlying patterns.\n2. **Personalized Federated Learning Framework**: Developing a framework that adapts global models to individual client data characteristics through local fine-tuning and knowledge distillation.\n3. **Handling Non-IID Data**: Incorporating strategies such as penalty terms to encourage local models to converge towards a shared optimum and exploring methods to improve communication efficiency during model updates.\n\n#### Methodology\n- **Data Collection**: Utilize diverse datasets, including medical imaging, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.\n- **Model Training**: Implement a federated learning setup where clients can train their models locally and share updates.\n- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, communication cost, and convergence speed.\n\n### Draft for Question 1: What is the problem?\nThe primary challenge in federated learning arises from the Non-IID nature of data across clients, leading to local models that diverge and inhibit effective learning. Existing methods, such as FedAvg and FedProx, often fall short in scenarios with significant data heterogeneity.\n\n### Request for Feedback\nI invite feedback on this proposed research direction and the draft for Question 1.

Existing federated learning mostly adopts the central server-based architecture or centralized architecture. However, in many social network scenarios, centralized federated learning is not applicable (e.g., a central agent or server connecting all users may not exist, or the communication cost to the central server is not affordable). In this paper, we consider a generic setting: 1) the central server may not exist, and 2) the social network is unidirectional or of single-sided trust (i.e., user A trusts user B but user B may not trust user A). We propose a central server free federated learning algorithm, named Online Push-Sum (OPS) method, to handle this challenging but generic scenario. A rigorous regret analysis is also provided, which shows very interesting results on how users can benefit from communication with trusted users in the federated learning scenario.

Recently, federated learning provides a secure and trustable alternative to collaboratively train model without any exchange of medical data among multiple institutes. Therefore, it has draw much attention due to its natural merit on privacy protection. However, when heterogenous medical data exists between different hospitals, federated learning usually has to face with degradation of performance. In the paper, we propose a new personalized framework of federated learning to handle the problem. It successfully yields personalized models based on awareness of similarity between local data, and achieves better tradeoff between generalization and personalization than existing methods. After that, we further design a differentially sparse regularizer to improve communication efficiency during procedure of model training. Additionally, we propose an effective method to reduce the computational cost, which improves computation efficiency significantly. Furthermore, we collect 5 real medical datasets, including 2 public medical image datasets and 3 private multi-center clinical diagnosis datasets, and evaluate its performance by conducting nodule classification, tumor segmentation, and clinical risk prediction tasks. Comparing with 13 existing related methods, the proposed method successfully achieves the best model performance, and meanwhile up to 60% improvement of communication efficiency.

Existing federated learning mostly adopts the central server-based architecture or centralized architecture. However, in many social network scenarios, centralized federated learning is not applicable (e.g., a central agent or server connecting all users may not exist, or the communication cost to the central server is not affordable). In this paper, we consider a generic setting: 1) the central server may not exist, and 2) the social network is unidirectional or of single-sided trust (i.e., user A trusts user B but user B may not trust user A). We propose a central server free federated learning algorithm, named Online Push-Sum (OPS) method, to handle this challenging but generic scenario. A rigorous regret analysis is also provided, which shows very interesting results on how users can benefit from communication with trusted users in the federated learning scenario. This work builds upon the fundamental algorithm framework and theoretical guarantees for federated learning in the generic social network scenario.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04956v2\", \"timestamp\": 1570765013, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"05447876-a2f9-43ae-86fe-25a866fe1c50\", \"authors\": [\"Yawei Zhao\", \"Qinghe Liu\", \"Xinwang Liu\", \"Kunlun He\"], \"title\": \"Medical Federated Model with Mixture of Personalized and Sharing Components\", \"abstract\": \"Although data-driven methods usually have noticeable performance on disease diagnosis and treatment, they are suspected of leakage of privacy due to collecting data for model training. Recently, federated learning provides a secure and trustable alternative to collaboratively train model without any exchange of medical data among multiple institutes. Therefore, it has draw much attention due to its natural merit on privacy protection. However, when heterogenous medical data exists between different hospitals, federated learning usually has to face with degradation of performance. In the paper, we propose a new personalized framework of federated learning to handle the problem. It successfully yields personalized models based on awareness of similarity between local data, and achieves better tradeoff between generalization and personalization than existing methods. After that, we further design a differentially sparse regularizer to improve communication efficiency during procedure of model training. Additionally, we propose an effective method to reduce the computational cost, which improves computation efficiency significantly. Furthermore, we collect 5 real medical datasets, including 2 public medical image datasets and 3 private multi-center clinical diagnosis datasets, and evaluate its performance by conducting nodule classification, tumor segmentation, and clinical risk prediction tasks. Comparing with 13 existing related methods, the proposed method successfully achieves the best model performance, and meanwhile up to 60% improvement of communication efficiency.

A paper on this topic could significantly influence future research by providing a framework that enhances trust in federated models, leading to broader adoption in sensitive applications such as healthcare and finance. Additionally, it could pave the way for more robust and interpretable AI systems that are essential for regulatory compliance and user acceptance.\",\n    \"Question 3\": \"The integration of model interpretability and knowledge distillation in personalized federated learning is complex due to the inherent statistical heterogeneity of client data, which can lead to model drift and inconsistencies.
