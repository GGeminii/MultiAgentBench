Security researchers spend many hours understanding these attacks and trying to classify them into known kinds like port sweep, password guess, teardrop, etc. How-ever, due to the constantly changing attack landscape and emergence of advanced per-sistent threats (APT), hackers are continuously finding new ways to attack systems. Hence a static list of classification of attacks will not be able to adapt to new and novel 2 tactics adopted by adversaries. Also, ML systems typically end up being black boxes and do not do a very good job explaining why they flag certain network traffic. Recent research in explainable AI [1] [2] has led to explainable AI (XAI) as a dedicated field of study to explain the reasoning behind predictions made by ML models. Hence, we propose an explainable AI [3] framework along with intrusion detection system which would help analyst to make final decision. For example, if we classify an attack as a \u2018guess password\u2019 and provide evidence that this is because the number of hot indicators is 1 and the source bytes is around 125 \u2013 it gives much better visibility to the security analyst on why the alert is flagged. Also, if the explanation matches the domain knowledge the analyst can easily approve it with confidence. Moreover, for a new attack when the anomaly is flagged and explanation given, the analyst may decide if this is a new pattern of unknown attack and possibly capture this as a rule [4] in a system like Zeek (formerly Bro-IDS). This analysis may eventually be combined with a natural language generating system that can provide concrete English statements explaining the alert and reasons for it. It is seen that Deep Neural Networks (DNN) [5] outperforms ML algorithms. As per accuracy vs interpretability graph, as accuracy of the models increases, interpretability decreases. Hence less interpretability of DNN is one of the reasons why they are not deployed for real use cases such as bank loan approval. With the help of explainable AI techniques, we can convert untrustworthy model into trustworthy.  Fig. 1. Steps involved in ML pipeline Above are the different steps involved in the ML pipeline. At every stage we can intro-duce explainable AI algorithms to get insights. Explanations generated using training data help to identify if there any biases present in the data, which can be modified before training the model. Explanations generated by using trained model can help to under-stand if model has learned any inappropriate rule or pattern, by retuning the model or reselecting the features better model can be obtained. Explanations which are instance specific can help to debug the model and also useful after model deployment. Thus, at every stage in ML pipeline these explanations make it easier to design and deploy best network intrusion detection system. Figure 2 shows how we can generate explanations for every type of user.

Hence, we propose an explainable AI [3] framework along with intrusion detection system which would help analyst to make final decision. For example, if we classify an attack as a \u2018guess password\u2019 and provide evidence that this is because the number of hot indicators is 1 and the source bytes is around 125 \u2013 it gives much better visibility to the security analyst on why the alert is flagged. Also, if the explanation matches the domain knowledge the analyst can easily approve it with confidence. Moreover, for a new attack when the anomaly is flagged and explanation given, the analyst may decide if this is a new pattern of unknown attack and possibly capture this as a rule [4] in a system like Zeek (formerly Bro-IDS). This analysis may eventually be combined with a natural language generating system that can provide concrete English statements explaining the alert and reasons for it. It is seen that Deep Neural Networks (DNN) [5] outperforms ML algorithms. As per accuracy vs interpretability graph, as accuracy of the models increases, interpretability decreases. Hence less interpretability of DNN is one of the reasons why they are not deployed for real use cases such as bank loan approval. With the help of explainable AI techniques, we can convert untrustworthy model into trustworthy.  Fig. 1. Steps involved in ML pipeline Above are the different steps involved in the ML pipeline. At every stage we can intro-duce explainable AI algorithms to get insights. Explanations generated using training data help to identify if there any biases present in the data, which can be modified before training the model. Explanations generated by using trained model can help to under-stand if model has learned any inappropriate rule or pattern, by retuning the model or reselecting the features better model can be obtained. Explanations which are instance specific can help to debug the model and also useful after model deployment.

Security researchers spend many hours understanding these attacks and trying to classify them into known kinds like port sweep, password guess, teardrop, etc. How-ever, due to the constantly changing attack landscape and emergence of advanced per-sistent threats (APT), hackers are continuously finding new ways to attack systems. Hence a static list of classification of attacks will not be able to adapt to new and novel 2 tactics adopted by adversaries. Also, ML systems typically end up being black boxes and do not do a very good job explaining why they flag certain network traffic. Recent research in explainable AI [1] [2] has led to explainable AI (XAI) as a dedicated field of study to explain the reasoning behind predictions made by ML models. Hence, we propose an explainable AI [3] framework along with intrusion detection system which would help analyst to make final decision. For example, if we classify an attack as a \u2018guess password\u2019 and provide evidence that this is because the number of hot indicators is 1 and the source bytes is around 125 \u2013 it gives much better visibility to the security analyst on why the alert is flagged. Also, if the explanation matches the domain knowledge the analyst can easily approve it with confidence. Moreover, for a new attack when the anomaly is flagged and explanation given, the analyst may decide if this is a new pattern of unknown attack and possibly capture this as a rule [4] in a system like Zeek (formerly Bro-IDS). This analysis may eventually be combined with a natural language generating system that can provide concrete English statements explaining the alert and reasons for it.

Security researchers spend many hours understanding these attacks and trying to classify them into known kinds like port sweep, password guess, teardrop, etc. How-ever, due to the constantly changing attack landscape and emergence of advanced per-sistent threats (APT), hackers are continuously finding new ways to attack systems. Hence a static list of classification of attacks will not be able to adapt to new and novel 2 tactics adopted by adversaries. Also, ML systems typically end up being black boxes and do not do a very good job explaining why they flag certain network traffic. Recent research in explainable AI [1] [2] has led to explainable AI (XAI) as a dedicated field of study to explain the reasoning behind predictions made by ML models. Hence, we propose an explainable AI [3] framework along with intrusion detection system which would help analyst to make final decision. For example, if we classify an attack as a \u2018guess password\u2019 and provide evidence that this is because the number of hot indicators is 1 and the source bytes is around 125 \u2013 it gives much better visibility to the security analyst on why the alert is flagged. Also, if the explanation matches the domain knowledge the analyst can easily approve it with confidence. Moreover, for a new attack when the anomaly is flagged and explanation given, the analyst may decide if this is a new pattern of unknown attack and possibly capture this as a rule [4] in a system like Zeek (formerly Bro-IDS). This analysis may eventually be combined with a natural language generating system that can provide concrete English statements explaining the alert and reasons for it. It is seen that Deep Neural Networks (DNN) [5] outperforms ML algorithms. As per accuracy vs interpretability graph, as accuracy of the models increases, interpretability decreases. Hence less interpretability of DNN is one of the reasons why they are not deployed for real use cases such as bank loan approval. With the help of explainable AI techniques, we can convert untrustworthy model into trustworthy.  Fig. 1. Steps involved in ML pipeline Above are the different steps involved in the ML pipeline. At every stage we can intro-duce explainable AI algorithms to get insights. Explanations generated using training data help to identify if there any biases present in the data, which can be modified before training the model. Explanations generated by using trained model can help to under-stand if model has learned any inappropriate rule or pattern, by retuning the model or reselecting the features better model can be obtained. Explanations which are instance specific can help to debug the model and also useful after model deployment.

Security researchers spend many hours understanding these attacks and trying to classify them into known kinds like port sweep, password guess, teardrop, etc. How-ever, due to the constantly changing attack landscape and emergence of advanced per-sistent threats (APT), hackers are continuously finding new ways to attack systems. Hence a static list of classification of attacks will not be able to adapt to new and novel 2 tactics adopted by adversaries. Also, ML systems typically end up being black boxes and do not do a very good job explaining why they flag certain network traffic. Recent research in explainable AI [1] [2] has led to explainable AI (XAI) as a dedicated field of study to explain the reasoning behind predictions made by ML models. Hence, we propose an explainable AI [3] framework along with intrusion detection system which would help analyst to make final decision. For example, if we classify an attack as a \u2018guess password\u2019 and provide evidence that this is because the number of hot indicators is 1 and the source bytes is around 125 \u2013 it gives much better visibility to the security analyst on why the alert is flagged. Also, if the explanation matches the domain knowledge the analyst can easily approve it with confidence. Moreover, for a new attack when the anomaly is flagged and explanation given, the analyst may decide if this is a new pattern of unknown attack and possibly capture this as a rule [4] in a system like Zeek (formerly Bro-IDS). This analysis may eventually be combined with a natural language generating system that can provide concrete English statements explaining the alert and reasons for it. It is seen that Deep Neural Networks (DNN) [5] outperforms ML algorithms. As per accuracy vs interpretability graph, as accuracy of the models increases, interpretability decreases. Hence less interpretability of DNN is one of the reasons why they are not deployed for real use cases such as bank loan approval. With the help of explainable AI techniques, we can convert untrustworthy model into trustworthy.  Fig. 1. Steps involved in ML pipeline Above are the different steps involved in the ML pipeline. At every stage we can intro-duce explainable AI algorithms to get insights. Explanations generated using training data help to identify if there any biases present in the data, which can be modified before training the model. Explanations generated by using trained model can help to under-stand if model has learned any inappropriate rule or pattern, by retuning the model or reselecting the features better model can be obtained. Explanations which are instance specific can help to debug the model and also useful after model deployment. Thus, at every stage in ML pipeline these explanations make it easier to design and deploy best network intrusion detection system.

The underlying concept of coordination among nodes in a cooperative MANET has induced in them a vulnerability to attacks due to issues like lack of fixed infrastructure, dynamically changing network topology, cooperative algorithms, lack of centralized monitoring and management point, and lack of a clear line of defense. We propose a semi-distributed approach towards Reputation Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that combines with the DSR routing protocol for strengthening the defense of a MANET. Our system inherits the features of reputation from human behavior, hence making the IDS socially inspired. It has a semi-distributed architecture as the critical observation results of the system are neither spread globally nor restricted locally. The system assigns maximum weightage to self observation by nodes for updating any reputation values, thus avoiding the need of a trust relationship between nodes. Our system is also unique in the sense that it features the concepts of Redemption and Fading with a robust Path Manager and Monitor system. Simulation studies show that DSR fortified with our system outperforms normal DSR in terms of the packet delivery ratio and routing overhead even when up to half of nodes in the network behave as malicious. Various parameters introduced such as timing window size, reputation update values, congestion parameter and other thresholds have been optimized over several simulation test runs of the system. By combining the semi-distributed architecture and other design essentials like path manager, monitor module, redemption and fading concepts; Our system proves to be robust enough to counter most common attacks in MANETs.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.1956v2\", \"timestamp\": 1276149824, \"domain\": \"cs.NI\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"2a2300d5-0188-41b3-8571-b128c7acbd89\", \"authors\": [\"Qingyao Ai\", \"Jingtao Zhan\", \"Yiqun Liu\"], \"title\": \"Foundations of GenIR\", \"abstract\": \"The chapter discusses the foundational impact of modern generative AI models on information access (IA) systems.

The viability of performing remote intrusions onto the in-vehicle network has been manifested. In regard to unmanned autonomous cars, limited work has been done to detect intrusions for them while existing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) embrace limitations against strong adversaries. In this paper, we consider the very nature of autonomous car and leverage the road context to build a novel IDS, named Road context-aware IDS (RAIDS). When a computer-controlled car is driving through continuous roads, road contexts and genuine frames transmitted on the car's in-vehicle network should resemble a regular and intelligible pattern. RAIDS hence employs a lightweight machine learning model to extract road contexts from sensory information (e.g., camera images and distance sensor values) that are used to generate control signals for maneuvering the car. With such ongoing road context, RAIDS validates corresponding frames observed on the in-vehicle network. Anomalous frames that substantially deviate from road context will be discerned as intrusions. We have implemented a prototype of RAIDS with neural networks, and conducted experiments on a Raspberry Pi with extensive datasets and meaningful intrusion cases. Evaluations show that RAIDS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IDS without using road context by up to 99.9% accuracy and short response time.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00732v1\", \"timestamp\": 1564732111, \"domain\": \"cs.CR\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"f402a356-0c09-46ef-9eb0-76fadc0aed8b\", \"authors\": [\"Steven McElwee\", \"James Cannady\"], \"title\": \"Cyber Situation Awareness with Active Learning for Intrusion Detection\", \"abstract\": \"Intrusion detection has focused primarily on detecting cyberattacks at the event-level.

Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have been shown to achieve\nnear expert-level performance in diagnosing dermatological conditions from images of skin lesions [Thomsen et al.,\n2020, Esteva et al., 2017], and that they are able to assist general practitioners as well as less experienced dermatologists\nin improving their diagnostic performance [Tschandl et al., 2020, Jain et al., 2021]. However, the lack of a good\nexplanation mechanism [Kelly et al., 2019] for ConvNet decisions is one of the main obstacles to their adoption as\nautomated diagnosis systems [Goodman and Flaxman, 2017, Kelly et al., 2019, Topol, 2019].

The increasing demand for dermatological care is exacerbated by the low\nperformance of general practitioners when diagnosing skin conditions [Federman et al., 1999], and by the global scarcity\nof expert dermatologists [Feng et al., 2018, Kringos et al., 2015].\nAutomation may help alleviate this problem. Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have been shown to achieve\nnear expert-level performance in diagnosing dermatological conditions from images of skin lesions [Thomsen et al.,\n2020, Esteva et al., 2017], and that they are able to assist general practitioners as well as less experienced dermatologists\nin improving their diagnostic performance [Tschandl et al., 2020, Jain et al., 2021]. However, the lack of a good\nexplanation mechanism [Kelly et al., 2019] for ConvNet decisions is one of the main obstacles to their adoption as\nautomated diagnosis systems [Goodman and Flaxman, 2017, Kelly et al., 2019, Topol, 2019]. A good explanation is\nexpected to be both plausible , i.e. as similar as possible to a human explanation, and faithful , i.e. to accurately represent\nthe inner workings of the network [Jacovi and Goldberg, 2020].\nDifferent mechanisms for explaining ConvNet decisions have been proposed [Simonyan et al., 2014, Selvaraju et al.,\n2017, Ribeiro et al., 2016].

The increasing demand for dermatological care is exacerbated by the low\nperformance of general practitioners when diagnosing skin conditions [Federman et al., 1999], and by the global scarcity\nof expert dermatologists [Feng et al., 2018, Kringos et al., 2015].\nAutomation may help alleviate this problem. Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have been shown to achieve\nnear expert-level performance in diagnosing dermatological conditions from images of skin lesions [Thomsen et al.,\n2020, Esteva et al., 2017], and that they are able to assist general practitioners as well as less experienced dermatologists\nin improving their diagnostic performance [Tschandl et al., 2020, Jain et al., 2021]. However, the lack of a good\nexplanation mechanism [Kelly et al., 2019] for ConvNet decisions is one of the main obstacles to their adoption as\nautomated diagnosis systems [Goodman and Flaxman, 2017, Kelly et al., 2019, Topol, 2019]. A good explanation is\nexpected to be both plausible , i.e. as similar as possible to a human explanation, and faithful , i.e. to accurately represent\nthe inner workings of the network [Jacovi and Goldberg, 2020].\nDifferent mechanisms for explaining ConvNet decisions have been proposed [Simonyan et al., 2014, Selvaraju et al.,\n2017, Ribeiro et al., 2016]. Within the medical imaging literature, the most common explainability Related work\nMachine learning-based dermatological diagnosis systems have been widely investigated, achieving experiments, we use an Ef\ufb01cientNet-B2 [Tan and Le, 2019] ConvNet pre-trained on\nthe ImageNet image recognition dataset [Deng et al., 2009] for feature extraction, with all layers \ufb01ne-tuned on the\nDermXDB data. Both models were trained for 93 epochs using the AdamW optimizer [Loshchilov and Hutter, 2018],\nthe cosine annealing with warm restarts learning rate scheduler [Loshchilov and Hutter, 2016], and a starting learning\nrate of 0.0005. Within the dense block we use linear layers with 64 neurons, dropout layers with 0.2 probability, and\nReLU activations. DermX is trained with \u0015D= 1,\u0015C= 1, while DermX+ uses \u0015D= 1,\u0015C= 1, and\u0015A= 10 .\nFurther information about the hyper-parameters used for training and other implementation details can be found in introduction of a structured ontology for\nthe diagnosis explanations to avoid manual processing of typos and synonyms.\nDiagnosis and explanation ontology Preliminary investigations also highlighted the importance of having a con-\nsistent explanation ontology. After analyzing free-text explanations, they were formalized as an extended list of skin\nlesion characteristics [Nast et al., 2016]. The characteristics set was selected to suf\ufb01ciently explain the six target\ndiseases [Oakley, 2017]. With the help of two senior dermatologists, several other relevant characteristics were added.\nThe resulting set of characteristics was split into non-localizable characteristics (e.g. age or sex), localizable charac-\nteristics (e.g. plaque or open comedo), and additional descriptive terms (e.g. red or well-circumscribed), according\nto the International League of Dermatological Societies\u2019 classi\ufb01cation [Nast et al., 2016]. Figure 3 illustrates the\n\ufb01nal DermXDB explanation taxonomy, while more information about the other two types of labels is available in Appendix Tables 18, 19, 20, and 21. DermX performs adequately well on all characteristics.

Each category presents a question related to an article and\nthe corresponding ground-truth answer.\n25 Appendix I.1.\nWe begin by capturing screenshots of home pages and then refine these images by removing white\nmargins and other non-news elements to ensure the content focuses on news information, not\nadvertisements or errors due to website blocking. For analysis, we select a quiz model from our pool of\ncurrent most powerful commercial multimodal models, such as GPT4-V , Claude-3-Opus, and Gemini-\n1.5-Pro. We then guide the quiz model to progressively ask questions across multiple dimensions,\nincluding (1) basic understanding (2) contextual analysis (3) deeper and broader implications (4)\nfurther insights. The models design a Q&A set to address these dimensions. Subsequently, another\nmodel from our pool reviews and revises the questions for accuracy and relevance.\nThe final Q&As are then reviewed by humans for ultimate validation. To balance data collection\ncosts and user evaluation, we aim to gather about 500 questions monthly, selecting 100-300 for our\nfinal L IVEBENCH problem set, tagged with identifiers like LiveBench-2024-05 .\n4.2.2 Evaluation Metrics & experiments to enhance our\nunderstanding of model architectures and training data.\n2.2 The Evaluation Trilemma\nOur ultimate goal is to find a wide-coverage, low-cost, and zero-contamination way to evaluate LMMs.\nHowever, even with LMM S-EVAL, we find it to be hard or even impossible. Specifically, once we\nscale the evaluation datasets to 50+, it becomes time-consuming to perform a full evaluation run on\nthose datasets. Besides, those benchmarks are also susceptible to contamination during the training\n3time[ 79]. As shown in Figure 1, we believe there is a trilemma in model evaluation. One can not\nachieve the three goals simultaneously but only find a trade-off. The LMSys Chatbot Arena [ 13]and\nAI2 WildVision [ 50] are foundational works in stressing wide coverage and anti-contamination.

This suggests that the agent has retrieved a paper from the arXiv repository.\n\nTo proceed, I will analyze the paper and generate a new research idea based on the introduction. Here is the summary of the paper:\n\nThe paper discusses the need for a unified evaluation framework for multimodal models (LMMs) to assess their performance across various tasks and dimensions. The authors propose a benchmark suite called LMM S-EVAL, which includes over 50 tasks and more than 10 models, ensuring wide coverage. They also introduce LMM S-EVAL LITE, an efficient benchmark set with reliable and aligned results categorized into Basic Understanding and Comparative Analysis.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is a new research idea:\n\n**[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nHow to develop a more comprehensive and efficient evaluation framework for multimodal models that balances wide coverage, low cost, and zero contamination?\n\n**[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nSolving this problem is crucial for the research community as it will enable the development of more accurate and reliable multimodal models, which can have significant implications for various applications such as natural language processing, computer vision, and human-computer interaction. A unified evaluation framework will also facilitate the comparison of different models and the identification of their strengths and weaknesses, leading to more informed decision-making in the development of AI systems.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nDeveloping a comprehensive and efficient evaluation framework for multimodal models is challenging due to the complexity of the tasks involved, the need for wide coverage, and the requirement for low cost and zero contamination. Naive or straightforward approaches may fail to address these challenges, and technical, theoretical, or practical obstacles such as data quality, model variability, and evaluation metrics need to be overcome.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has focused on developing individual evaluation metrics or benchmarks for specific tasks, but a unified framework that balances wide coverage, low cost, and zero contamination has not been developed. Existing solutions have limitations, such as being task-specific or requiring significant resources, which have prevented the development of a comprehensive evaluation framework.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur approach will involve the development of a modular evaluation framework that includes a set of standardized evaluation metrics, a dataset of multimodal tasks, and a scalable evaluation pipeline. We will use a combination of machine learning and human evaluation to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results. The expected outcomes will be a comprehensive and efficient evaluation framework that can be used to assess the performance of multimodal models across various tasks and dimensions, enabling the development of more accurate and reliable AI systems.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": [], "total_milestones": 1, "agent_kpis": {"agent3": 1}}], "planning_scores": [4], "communication_scores": [-1], "token_usage": 15734, "agent_kpis": {"agent3": 1}, "total_milestones": 1, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 3, "safety": 4, "feasibility": 4}}

(2020); Fatemi et\u00a0al. (2021). In GSL, the primary focus lies in unraveling the latent relationships and dependencies that may not be immediately discernible from the raw data. By generating these novel graph structures, GSL empowers us to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the data, thereby facilitating various downstream tasks, such as node classification\u00a0Zhao et\u00a0al. (2021a).\n\n\nIn recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have indeed captured significant attention and popularity due to their remarkable capacity to model and leverage relationships within graph-structured data\u00a0Garg et\u00a0al. (2020); Buterez et\u00a0al. (2022). GNNs excel in learning node-level representations by effectively aggregating and propagating information from neighboring nodes in a graph. This exceptional capability has sparked a revolution in the analysis of graph-structured data, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying node-wise connection patterns and interactions.\n\n\nThe ability to capture and leverage the intricate dependencies within graphs has undoubtedly propelled graph neural networks (GNNs) to the forefront of graph structure learning\u00a0Zhou et\u00a0al. (2023). Notably, approaches like SLAPS Fatemi et\u00a0al. (2021), Nodeformer Wu et\u00a0al. (2022), and GT Shi et\u00a0al. (2021) incorporate neural networks that collaborate with GNNs to generate novel graph structures. These models undergo co-optimization, ensuring a seamless and integrated learning process. Moreover, recent studies such as SEGSL\u00a0Zou et\u00a0al. (2023) and CoGSL Liu et\u00a0al. (2022a) have introduced dynamic methods for learning the graph structure. These approaches adaptively learn the graph structure based on predictions or representations generated by optimized GNNs.\n\n\nWhile graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their high effectiveness, it is important to acknowledge that many of these approaches heavily depend on explicit graph structures, such as node links, as supervision signals for learning accurate representations. However, real-world graph domains often encounter challenges such as data noise and sparsity, which can compromise the reliability of these explicit graph structures.\n\n\nTo illustrate, let\u2019s consider a social network dataset where certain links are missing or incomplete due to privacy settings or limited data availability\u00a0Dai et\u00a0al. (2022). Additionally, in recommender systems, the user-item interaction graph may involve cold-start users or items, resulting in highly sparse links\u00a0Lin et\u00a0al. (2021). Furthermore, various types of bias present in recommender systems introduce noise into the data\u00a0Wang et\u00a0al. (2021b). In such cases, relying solely on explicit graph structures as supervision signals can lead to representations that are either inaccurate or biased. These challenges necessitate the development of more robust graph structure learning framework that can adapt to and overcome the impact of data imperfections in graph-structured data. \n\n\n\nContributions. In light of the challenges outlined earlier, this study seeks to explore how large language models (LLMs) can contribute to reasoning about the underlying graph structures. We introduce our proposed model, GraphEdit, which is designed to effectively refine graph structures. Our model\u2019s objective is twofold: first, to identify and address noisy connections between irrelevant nodes, and second, to uncover implicit node-wise dependencies. To achieve these goals, our model leverages the rich textual data associated with nodes in graph-structured data.

(2020); Fatemi et\u00a0al. (2021). In GSL, the primary focus lies in unraveling the latent relationships and dependencies that may not be immediately discernible from the raw data. By generating these novel graph structures, GSL empowers us to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the data, thereby facilitating various downstream tasks, such as node classification\u00a0Zhao et\u00a0al. (2021a).\n\n\nIn recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have indeed captured significant attention and popularity due to their remarkable capacity to model and leverage relationships within graph-structured data\u00a0Garg et\u00a0al. (2020); Buterez et\u00a0al. (2022). GNNs excel in learning node-level representations by effectively aggregating and propagating information from neighboring nodes in a graph. This exceptional capability has sparked a revolution in the analysis of graph-structured data, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying node-wise connection patterns and interactions.\n\n\nThe ability to capture and leverage the intricate dependencies within graphs has undoubtedly propelled graph neural networks (GNNs) to the forefront of graph structure learning\u00a0Zhou et\u00a0al. (2023). Notably, approaches like SLAPS Fatemi et\u00a0al. (2021), Nodeformer Wu et\u00a0al. (2022), and GT Shi et\u00a0al. (2021) incorporate neural networks that collaborate with GNNs to generate novel graph structures. These models undergo co-optimization, ensuring a seamless and integrated learning process. Moreover, recent studies such as SEGSL\u00a0Zou et\u00a0al. (2023) and CoGSL Liu et\u00a0al. (2022a) have introduced dynamic methods for learning the graph structure. These approaches adaptively learn the graph structure based on predictions or representations generated by optimized GNNs.\n\n\nWhile graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their high effectiveness, it is important to acknowledge that many of these approaches heavily depend on explicit graph structures, such as node links, as supervision signals for learning accurate representations. However, real-world graph domains often encounter challenges such as data noise and sparsity, which can compromise the reliability of these explicit graph structures.\n\n\nTo illustrate, let\u2019s consider a social network dataset where certain links are missing or incomplete due to privacy settings or limited data availability\u00a0Dai et\u00a0al. (2022). Additionally, in recommender systems, the user-item interaction graph may involve cold-start users or items, resulting in highly sparse links\u00a0Lin et\u00a0al. (2021). Furthermore, various types of bias present in recommender systems introduce noise into the data\u00a0Wang et\u00a0al. (2021b). In such cases, relying solely on explicit graph structures as supervision signals can lead to representations that are either inaccurate or biased. These challenges necessitate the development of more robust graph structure learning framework that can adapt to and overcome the impact of data imperfections in graph-structured data. \n\n\n\nContributions. In light of the challenges outlined earlier, this study seeks to explore how large language models (LLMs) can contribute to reasoning about the underlying graph structures. We introduce our proposed model, GraphEdit, which is designed to effectively refine graph structures. Our model\u2019s objective is twofold: first, to identify and address noisy connections between irrelevant nodes, and second, to uncover implicit node-wise dependencies. To achieve these goals, our model leverages the rich textual data associated with nodes in graph-structured data.

This strategic use\nof statistical weighting in models integrating two modalities\ndistinctly outperforms single-modality models, affirming the\nsuperiority of a multimodal fusion approach. This research un-\nderscores the efficacy of partitioning input features into distinct\nmodalities coupled with the judicious use of statistical weight-\ning at the decision layer, thereby substantially improving the\nprecision and reliability of protective behavior detection. It\npaves the way for sophisticated multimodal integration inhuman-centered computing, setting a benchmark for handling\ncomplex, varied datasets with enhanced accuracy.\nAdopting a human-centered approach to segment the dataset\ninto four modalities demonstrates potential enhancements in\nmodel performance. Particularly, models employing CNN-\nAttention mechanisms exhibit slight but positive differences,\nsuggesting an improved capability in capturing pain behavior\nfeatures. This indicates that modality segmentation, guided by\nhuman-centered principles, can amplify model effectiveness.\nFurther analysis reveals that models employing statistical\nweighting generally outperform those using mean weighting,\nexcept in the case of LSTM with four modalities employing\naverage weighting\u2014a scenario that mirrors the trade-offs\nobserved in single-modality LSTM models.\nThis investigation emphasizes the advantage of multimodal\nstrategies, where strategic feature grouping and statistical\ndecision-making markedly elevate model efficacy. Our findings\nparticularly highlight the utility of attention mechanisms, like\nCNN-Attention and CNN with Multi-head Self-Attention, in a\nfour-modality framework, reinforcing the benefits of human-\ncentered modality segmentation. Overall, the transition to a\nfour-modality model, grounded in human-centered design and\nstatistical weighting, is validated as superior to single-modality\napproaches, bolstering the case for sophisticated multimodal\nfusion in enhancing protective behavior recognition.\nThe examination distinctly emphasizes the superiority of\nstatistical weighting over average weighting in multimodal\nconfigurations, enhancing model performance. However, an\nexception was observed in the LSTM model utilizing average\nweighting, suggesting a nuanced balance between accuracy\nand other metrics. Despite this, the evidence strongly supports\nthe advantages of the multimodal approach over singular\nmodality frameworks. This finding reinforces the idea that\nstrategic segmentation of modalities, when combined with\nstatistical weighting, markedly advances protective behavior\ndetection models.\nThis study highlights the critical importance of a human-\ncentered modality segmentation strategy and the precise ap-\nplication of statistical Introduction\nIn this research, we utilized the EmoPain dataset, a key\nresource for exploring the relationship between body move-\nments and pain intensity levels [21].

This research has the potential to advance knowledge in the field of human-centered computing and multimodal fusion, and could lead to practical applications in healthcare and other fields. Addressing this question could also lead to the development of more sophisticated models that can better capture the complex relationships between body movements, pain intensity, and emotional states.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThis problem is challenging because it requires the development of models that can effectively integrate multiple modalities of data, including body joint coordinates, surface electromyography data, and protective behavior labels. The complexity of the problem is further exacerbated by the need to consider the nuances of human behavior and the variability in pain recognition and emotional computation. Naive or straightforward approaches may fail to capture the subtleties of these relationships, and may not be able to effectively handle the complexity of the data. Technical, theoretical, and practical obstacles that need to be overcome include the development of robust and efficient algorithms for multimodal fusion, the selection of appropriate metrics for evaluating model performance, and the need for large and diverse datasets to train and validate the models.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrevious research has made progress in developing multimodal fusion models for detecting protective behavior, but there are still gaps in the literature. For example, most existing models have focused on single-modality approaches, and there is a need for more research on multimodal fusion models that can effectively integrate multiple sources of data. Additionally, there is a lack of standardization in the evaluation metrics and datasets used to assess model performance, which can make it difficult to compare the results of different studies. Our approach differs from prior work by focusing on the development of human-centered modality segmentation and statistical weighting strategies, which have been shown to improve model performance in previous research.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nOur proposed methodology involves the development of a multimodal fusion model that integrates body joint coordinates, surface electromyography data, and protective behavior labels. We will use a human-centered modality segmentation approach to divide the data into four modalities, and will apply statistical weighting strategies to combine the features from each modality. We will evaluate the performance of our model using a range of metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall. We expect our model to outperform existing single-modality approaches and to provide more accurate and reliable results for detecting protective behavior.", "continue_simulation": false, "communications": [], "total_milestones": 0, "agent_kpis": {}}], "planning_scores": [4], "communication_scores": [-1], "token_usage": 59879, "agent_kpis": {}, "total_milestones": 0, "task_evaluation": {"innovation": 3, "safety": 5, "feasibility": 5}}
