{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nGeneral policies are policies that can be used to solve a collection of planning\nproblems\nreactively\u00a0Srivastava et al. (2008); Hu and Giacomo (2011); Belle and\nLevesque (2016); Bonet and\nGeffner (2018); Illanes and\nMcIlraith (2019); Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2019).\nFor example, a general policy for solving all Blocksworld problems can place\nall blocks on the table, and then build up the target towers from the bottom up.\nYet while nearly perfect general policies have been learned for many classes of\nplanning\ndomains\u00a0Toyer et al. (2020); Rivlin et al. (2020); St\u00e5hlberg et al. (2022a),\none key expressive limitation results from the types of features used to\nclassify state transitions or actions. In combinatorial approaches, features are\nselected from a domain-independent pool, created using a description logic\ngrammar\u00a0Baader et al. (2003) based on the given domain\npredicates\u00a0Bonet and\nGeffner (2018); Bonet et al. (2019), while in deep\nlearning approaches, the features are learned using relational versions of graph\nneural networks\nScarselli et al. (2009); Gilmer et al. (2017); Hamilton (2020). A shared\nlimitation of both approaches, however, is their inability to learn\npolicies requiring complex logical features. This limitation arises in\ndescription logics from the C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT fragment of first-order logic that they\ncapture; namely, first-order logic limited to two variables and\ncounting\u00a0Baader et al. (2003), and in GNNs, from the type of message passing\nthat is accommodated, where direct communication involves pairs of objects but\nno triplets\u00a0Grohe (2021).\n\n\nThis expressive limitation, not always acknowledged, is serious. For example,\nalthough these methods can learn general policies for guiding an agent to a\nspecific cell in an n\u00d7n\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5bn\\times nitalic_n \u00d7 italic_n grid containing obstacles, with\npositions and adjacency relations defined in terms of cells and atoms such as\nAt\u2062(c)At\ud835\udc50\\textsc{At}(c)At ( italic_c ) and Adj\u2062(c,c\u2032)Adj\ud835\udc50superscript\ud835\udc50\u2032\\textsc{Adj}(c,c^{\\prime})Adj ( italic_c , italic_c start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), they lack the expressive\ncapacity when the relations are represented with atoms like At\u2062(x,y)At\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66\\textsc{At}(x,y)At ( italic_x , italic_y ),\nAdj1\u2062(x,x\u2032)subscriptAdj1\ud835\udc65superscript\ud835\udc65\u2032\\textsc{Adj}_{1}(x,x^{\\prime})Adj start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_x , italic_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), and Adj2\u2062(y,y\u2032)subscriptAdj2\ud835\udc66superscript\ud835\udc66\u2032\\textsc{Adj}_{2}(y,y^{\\prime})Adj start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_y , italic_y start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ). Similarly, these methods\nare unable to learn policies for classical benchmark domains such as Logistics\nand Grid, that require composition of binary relations, which is beyond the\nscope of C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\u00a0[St\u00e5hlberg et al.,\n2022b; 2023].\n\n\nIn principle, this limitation can be addressed by using richer grammars to\ngenerate non-C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT features or by using k\ud835\udc58kitalic_k-GNNs, for k=3\ud835\udc583k=3italic_k = 3, where triplets of\nobjects are embedded instead of individual objects\u00a0Morris et al. (2019).\nIt is known that 3-GNNs have the expressive power of C3subscript\ud835\udc363C_{3}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT logic, unlike the\nC2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT expressive power of 1- and 2-GNNs\u00a0Grohe (2021). Yet 3-GNNs do not\nscale up as they require cubic number of embeddings, and quartic time for\nexchanging messages.\n\n\nIn this paper, we introduce an alternative, parameterized version of Relational\nGNNs (R-GNNs). The architecture for R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] mirrors that of plain R-GNNs\nand differs only in the input. While plain R-GNNs take the set of atoms S\ud835\udc46Sitalic_S\nrepresenting a planning state as input, R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] accepts a transformed set\nof atoms At\u2062(S)subscript\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc46A_{t}(S)italic_A start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_S ) instead. At t=0\ud835\udc610t=0italic_t = 0, R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] approximates 3-GNNs weakly,\nwhile at t=\u221e\ud835\udc61t=\\inftyitalic_t = \u221e, it offers a strong approximation. Thus, the parameter t\ud835\udc61titalic_t\nserves to balance expressive power with computational effort.

In these settings, effective tracking of working memory is necessary to infer the agent\\u2019s latent previous state (Zhang et al., 2024).\\n\\n\\nIn this work, we investigate the long-horizon planning abilities of LRMs using a highly simplified variant of the Sokoban puzzle\\u00a0(Culberson, 1998). Rather than increasing spatial complexity, we deliberately minimize the structural complexity of the environment while preserving the long-horizon nature of the task by creating examples with\\nthe lowest possible branching factor compatible with solvability: a single movable block placed within a linear corridor with tightly controlled geometry.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis setting allows us to isolate long-horizon planning from state persistence: models are required to produce complete solution sequences without external memory, intermediate feedback, or state validation, relying solely on internal state representations to track the evolving environment.\\nWe therefore investigate to what extent LRMs can sustain coherent planning over long (but simple) action sequences and whether even minimal reasoning branching in otherwise trivial Sokoban instances is sufficient to induce planning failures.\\n\\n\\nConcretely, we examine whether current LRMs can reliably solve linear-corridor Sokoban puzzles with minimal possible branching and identify the point at which increases in horizon length lead to catastrophic breakdowns in action validity, despite the simplicity of the underlying environment.\\nAs we will show these minimal sub-problems which are trivial to humans (Jaru\\u0161ek and Pel\\u00e1nek, 2010), are still challenging for Large Reasoning Models as shown by other preliminary studies involving spatial intelligence (Cai et al., 2025).\\nWe posit this as a systemic deficiency in long-term action representation and sequential logic, and in spatial reasoning and thus as an important limitation of current LRMs that is not yet fully understood.\\n\\n\", \"2 Related Work\": \"\\n\\n2 Related Work\\n\\n\\n2.1 Benchmarks for LLM Planning\\n\\nAs mentioned above, planning requires LLMs to blend logical, numerical, and spatial reasoning with long-horizon strategic adaptation, rather than just relying on pattern matching or memorization.\\nClassical planning domains expressed in or derived from the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL (Fox and Long, 2003)), such as BlocksWorld (Slaney and Thi\\u00e9baux, 2001), Towers of Hanoi and similar tasks (Pallagani et al., 2023), remain a common benchmark choice, though earlier attempts date back to the pre-ChatGPT era (Silver et al., 2022).\\nTest suites like PlanBench (Valmeekam et al., 2022) introduced structured, domain-agnostic evaluations inspired by classical planning (Ghallab et al., 2016), including plan generation (Oswald et al., 2024; Valmeekam et al., 2025; La Malfa et al., 2025) and optimality (Valmeekam et al., 2022; Zhai and others, 2025; Valmeekam et al., 2023a).\\n\\n\\nIn another line of work, planning is evaluated within agentic or workflow-based frameworks, where LLMs are required to decompose goals into multiple sub-plans (Meyerson et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025; La Malfa et al., 2025).\\nThe results in these settings are encouraging though highly cost intensive.\\nImportantly, when not equipped with external tools or made part of larger workflows (e.g., enabling stateful tracking (Hu et al., 2025b)), innate planning abilities remain still weak (Schepanowski and Ling, 2025).\\nEven the latest foundational models are found to consistently fail in delivering correct sequences of actions (in any format or language) due to two primary deficits: weak internal state representations leading to invalid moves and misleading heuristic search resulting in loops or early termination, as shown in the textual game \\u201c8-puzzle\\u201d in Schepanowski and Ling (2025).\\nMoreover, efficacy of different prompting techniques is model-dependent in a non-predictable way (Schepanowski and Ling, 2025; Deng et al., 2025).\\n\\n\\nOther works have systematically investigated the performances of LLMs in playing textual games with gym-style APIs (Brockman et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2025a).\\nBeyond structured puzzles, community-driven and informal game-oriented benchmarks like word-game bench (Stojanovski, 2024) and nonogram logic puzzles (Berend et al., 2014; Kleine, 2026) with multi-difficulty instances have been devised to measure how well models plan under both explicit and implicit constraints, track environment states, and adapt over multiple turns.\\nThe varying depth of planning ability required helps to reveal how performance scales with complexity and structure.\\n\\n\\nIn general, existing benchmarks using specific planning languages and/or internal reasoning traces expressed in natural language show that LLMs exhibit limited planning abilities in various domains (Kambhampati et al., 2024), especially as the complexity and horizon length of the problems increase.\\nThis gap motivates the development of new benchmarks tailored to planning and solving structured textual puzzles with LLMs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2.2 Sokoban as a Benchmark for Planning\\n\\nThe Sokoban puzzle involves spatial planning in a highly constrained environment. Solvable Sokoban maps can be generated efficiently (Murase et al., 1996), and the environment is fully controllable and deterministic. These properties enable rigorous evaluation using exact solvers and verifiers, as well as metrics such as search depth and solution time (Jaru\\u0161ek and Pel\\u00e1nek, 2010; Shoham and Schaeffer, 2020).\\nUnlike puzzles such as the Tower of Hanoi, which can be solved by repeating a simple pattern for larger instances, Sokoban offers no shortcuts.\\nEach map is unique, and moving a single box can block or open paths in ways that prevent a one-size-fits-all solution.\\nAs a result, Sokoban is considered a good benchmark for evaluating planning abilities in the 2023 edition of the International Planning Competition\\u00a0(Taitler et al., 2024).\\n\\n\\nRecently, recurrent neural networks (non LLM-based) trained over multiple examples of Sokoban puzzles have obtained state of the art performance (Jolicoeur-Martineau, 2025; Taufeeque et al., 2024).\\nHowever, LLMs are found to perform poorly, struggling even with simple maps and correctly solving only a small fraction of instances: Valmeekam et al. (2025) report success rates of just about 10\\u201312% when using the OpenAI o1-preview model directly.\\nIn contrast, substantially higher success rates are achieved in an LLM-Modulo setting, where the same model is used to generate plans that are then executed by an external planner, yielding approximately 43% solved instances for o1-preview (and about 10% for o1-mini), albeit at significantly higher computational cost.\\n\\n\\nMost prior work on textual puzzle solving and planning with LLMs has emphasized high-level notions such as search depth, branching factor, or overall puzzle complexity.\\nMuch less attention has been paid to the role of simpler, low-level operations that these tasks implicitly rely on.\\nEvidence from seemingly trivial problems suggests that LLM failures do not always stem from complexity itself, but from how basic reasoning steps are elicited.\\nA well-known example is the character-counting question \\u201chow many r\\u2019s are in strawberry?\\u201d (Karpathy, 2024), which has sparked debate over whether LLM errors are caused by tokenization or deeper representational limits\\u00a0(Shin and Kaneko, 2024).\\nThe work by Xu and Ma (2025) revisits this issue through a careful empirical study, showing that LLMs are in fact capable of performing these simple symbolic operations, but often fail unless prompted to reason explicitly.\\nCharacter-level benchmarks, such as CharBench (Uzan and Pinter, 2025), shows that modern LLMs struggle with simple character counting and positioning tasks not because tokenization fully explains these errors, but because intrinsic properties like word length and actual character count have a stronger influence on performance, indicating that basic symbolic operations are not reliably deployed unless the model is guided to engage them explicitly.\\n\\n\\nPut together, these observations point to a broader interpretation of failures in spatial planning and puzzle games, suggesting that they may arise from missing or weak activation of basic operations, rather than from the inherent difficulty of the planning problem.\\n\\n\\n\", \"3 Methods\": \"\\n\\n3 Methods\\n\\n\\n3.1 Sokoban game\\n\\nFigure\\u00a01 shows an example of a Sokoban puzzle and the game\\u2019s central mechanic: the player controls a sprite that pushes boxes within a two-dimensional spatially constrained environment with the goal to position them onto predefined locations.\\nDespite its apparent simplicity, Sokoban is a NP-hard and PSPACE-complete problem (Culberson, 1998), positioning it as a canonical domain for symbolic and hierarchical planning.\\nApart from the pictorial representation, Sokoban maps can be encoded using an ASCII-based symbolic representation as expressed in Table\\u00a01.\\nSequences of main character actions are typically encoded in LURD format (left,up,right,down), with lowercase letters indicating simple moves, and uppercase letters indicating box pushes.\\nAlthough moves and pushes have distinct notations in classical Sokoban planning, in our experiments we restrict only to comma-separated uppercase letters.\\nThis representation does not compromise the information content of the solutions and simplifies the output format for language models, avoiding potential mistakes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 1: Example of a Sokoban puzzle.

The maps share the same initial configuration in which the goal is positioned at one end of the map, the player at the opposite end, and the box placed in between the two, so that all elements lie along the same row or column.\\nThis choice is motivated by its simplicity: the corridor length \\u2113\\\\ell is the only map parameter and it serves as a proxy for map difficulty.\\nHence, with just one degree of freedom to account for, we overcome the problem of defining complex measures for solution difficulty: the longer the map, the harder the task.\\n\\n\\nIn our benchmark, we consider map lengths \\u2113\\\\ell ranging from 5 to 100 in increments of 5. For each map, we generate four augmented variants corresponding to rotations of 90\\u221890^{\\\\circ}, 180\\u2218180^{\\\\circ}, and 270\\u2218270^{\\\\circ}, as well as the original (unrotated) orientation.\\nThis augmentation strategy reduces the risk of querying the model with data that may have been encountered during pretraining and enables analysis of whether models exhibit orientation-dependent performance.\\nIn total, the evaluation set comprises 80 distinct maps, spanning 20 values of \\u2113\\\\ell with four orientations each.\\nWe publicly release our dataset at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Linello/sokobanlevels.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3 Experimental Setup\\n\\nWe employ both open and closed weights model, specifically DeepSeek R1 (Guo et al., 2025), GPT-5 and GPT-oss 120B\\u00a0(OpenAI, 2026; 2025).\\nThey are all reasoning models, i.e., they are configured to generate an explicit reasoning trace prior to emitting the final answer to the user query.\\nFor GPT models, we don\\u2019t change the default temperature neither the default reasoning effort (set to medium).\\nInstead we cap the maximum number of completion tokens (including both reasoning and final answer tokens) at 32,76832{,}768.\\nAll inference calls are routed through OpenRouter,111https://openrouter.ai/ with the inference provider consistently set to DeepInfra.222https://deepinfra.com/\\nIn light of both computational and financial resource constraints, we limit our empirical analysis to these two primary model families.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3.1 1-shot Inference\\n\\nIn the first experimental setup, we test the ability of the selected LRMs to solve simple Sokoban puzzles when provided only with the instructions, the mapping of characters as in Table\\u00a01 and a single demonstration.\\nUnder this setup, thus, models are by design limited to use exclusively their internal state representations to solve Sokoban puzzles of varying solution lengths.\\nThe prompts used for all models are described in Appendix A.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3.2 LLM-Modulo\\n\\nIn the second experimental setup, we investigated how Sokoban puzzle\\u2013solving performance can be enhanced when LRMs are provided with access to external planning solvers, within an LLM-modulo framework analogous to that of Valmeekam et al. (2023a).\\nTo this end, we prompted the models to generate specific instances of planning problems while providing them with a pre-existing, human-authored and verified PDDL domain (Appendix B.2).\\nIn this setup, the model is responsible solely for formulating the PDDL problem, which is then processed through an agentic pipeline.\\nThis workflow utilizes a domain parser to instantiate the formal world representation and a dedicated problem parser that acts as a validator, informing the model whether the generated problem is syntactically and semantically well-formed.\\nFinally, the pipeline provides access to specialized PDDL planners such as Fast-Downward or PyperPlan, integrated via the Unified Planning library (Micheli et al., 2025; Alkhazraji et al., 2020; Helmert, 2006) to solve the problem and get the optimal plan.\\nAll the tools were wrapped and made accessible to the LRMs via a custom Model Context Protocol library (Anthropic, 2024) implemented with FastMCP library (Lowin, 2024).\\nThe design of our architecture is shown in Figure\\u00a02.\\n\\n\\nThe planner tool produces a variety of diagnostic and informational messages that are provided back to the model, including error reports, timing information, and the complete raw response.\\nThis raw response can be further processed to extract the LURD solution in cases where the problem is successfully solved.\\nIn failure scenarios, the tool returns the encountered errors in natural language to the LRM.\\nErrors or warnings are generated in situations such as logically inconsistent or unsatisfiable problems, invalid or inappropriate initial conditions, or when the solver exceeds the maximum allotted execution time (60 seconds).\\nThe agentic loop ends either with a valid plan or with a message to the final user explaining that, after three failed attempts (which may include having the LRM reformulate the PDDL problem), the agent could not find a satisfactory solution.\\n\\n\\nThe LRM-modulo pipeline is considerably slower than the reasoning-only one.\\nIt took an average of 75 minutes using GPT-5-mini on an AWS t3.xlarge instance (4 CPUs at 3.1 GHz, 16 GB RAM) to collect the points shown in Figure\\u00a06(a).\\nThe prompts being used for the experiments are described in Appendix\\u00a0B.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: Panel (a) represents a simple schema of our LLM-modulo pipeline. The detailed input prompts are collected in Appendix\\u00a0B.1, while an example of output is shown in Panel (b).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4 Evaluation\\n\\nA solution to a Sokoban instance is defined as a sequence of actions that transforms the system from its initial configuration to the final state, where all boxes are correctly placed on goal positions.\\nMultiple valid solutions may exist for the same map, however we restrict the evaluation only to optimal solutions, i.e., sequences that achieve the goal with the minimum possible number of moves. The intrinsic simplicity of our setting makes optimality the natural criterion.\\nClearly, the one-dimensional layout of the map allows only for a unique optimal solution.\\n\\n\\nAccuracy:\\n\\nGiven a map of length \\u2113\\\\ell, we define the accuracy in Eq.\\u00a01 as the expectation, over all repetitions and rotations NN of the indicator of exact string equality (via Iverson brackets) between the predicted action sequence \\ud835\\udc31^(\\u2113)\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}^{(\\\\ell)} and the ground-truth sequence \\ud835\\udc31(\\u2113)\\\\mathbf{x}^{(\\\\ell)}, i.e., the fraction of trials in which the two character strings are identical:\\n\\n\\n\\nAccuracy\\u200b(\\u2113)=1N\\u200b\\u2211n=1N[\\ud835\\udc31^(\\u2113)=\\ud835\\udc31(\\u2113)].\\\\rm{Accuracy}(\\\\ell)=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{n=1}^{N}[\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}^{(\\\\ell)}=\\\\mathbf{x}^{(\\\\ell)}].\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n\\nHere NN is the product of the total number of trials ntn_{t} and the number of map rotations nr=4n_{r}=4.\\nIncreasing ntn_{t} mitigates the intrinsic non-determinism of the obtained solutions, by sampling at multiple seeds.\\nIn the LRM experiments, we set the number of repetitions ntn_{t} to 8.\\nConversely, in the LRM-modulo experiments, the substantially higher computational and monetary costs imposed stricter constraints.\\nWe therefore reduced the number of repetitions ntn_{t} to 4.\\n\\n\\n\\nPrefix accuracy:\\n\\nAlongside the standard accuracy metric, we define Prefix Accuracy (Eq.\\u00a02) to provide a more granular evaluation of model performance.\\nThis metric calculates the average proportion of correct symbols generated by comparing the predicted and true plans\\u2019 strings element-wise:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrefixAccuracy\\u200b(\\u2113)=1N\\u200b\\u2211n=1N[m(n)\\u2264\\u2113]\\u2113\\u200b\\u2211i=1m(n)[x^i(n)=xi(n)],\\\\text{PrefixAccuracy}(\\\\ell)=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{n=1}^{N}\\\\frac{[m^{(n)}\\\\leq\\\\ell]}{\\\\ell}\\\\sum_{i=1}^{m^{(n)}}[\\\\hat{x}_{i}^{(n)}=x_{i}^{(n)}],\\n\\n(2)\\n\\n\\nwhere m(n)m^{(n)} is the length of the predicted plan \\ud835\\udc31^(n)\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}^{(n)}.\\nUnlike the hard matching of the standard accuracy metric, prefix-accuracy is more optimistic, rewarding the model for correct partial trajectories even if it stops prematurely.\\nHowever, it remains strictly penalized for overshooting: if the predicted length m(n)m^{(n)} exceeds the ground-truth length \\u2113\\\\ell, the score for that trial is 0.\\nFor instance, a prediction \\ud835\\udc31^(n)=(l, l, l)\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}^{(n)}=(\\\\texttt{l, l, l}) against a ground truth \\ud835\\udc31(n)=(l, l, l, l)\\\\mathbf{x}^{(n)}=(\\\\texttt{l, l, l, l}) yields a score of 3/43/4, whereas any prediction exceeding length 4 results in a score of 0.\\n\\n\\n\\nManhattan Distance:\\n\\nWhile string-based metrics evaluate the symbolic fidelity of the action sequence, they do not account for the spatial proximity of the agent to the objective.\\nWe therefore use the Manhattan Distance (Eq.\\u00a03) to measure the L1L_{1} distance between the agent\\u2019s terminal position and the goal, independent of sequence semantics or environmental obstacles.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nD\\u200b(\\u2113)=1N\\u200b\\u2211n=1N(|xfinal(n)\\u2212xgoal(n)|+|yfinal(n)\\u2212ygoal(n)|)D(\\\\ell)=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{n=1}^{N}\\\\left(|x^{(n)}_{\\\\text{final}}-x^{(n)}_{\\\\text{goal}}|+|y^{(n)}_{\\\\text{final}}-y^{(n)}_{\\\\text{goal}}|\\\\right)\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere, (xfinal(n),yfinal(n))(x^{(n)}_{\\\\text{final}},y^{(n)}_{\\\\text{final}}) represents the agent\\u2019s coordinates after executing all moves in the predicted sequence \\ud835\\udc31^(n)\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}^{(n)}, starting from the origin (0,0)(0,0). The goal coordinates (xgoal(n),ygoal(n))(x^{(n)}_{\\\\text{goal}},y^{(n)}_{\\\\text{goal}}) are always at a fixed distance \\u2113\\\\ell from the origin, specifically (\\u00b1\\u2113,0)(\\\\pm\\\\ell,0) for 0\\u2218/180\\u22180^{\\\\circ}/180^{\\\\circ} rotations and (0,\\u00b1\\u2113)(0,\\\\pm\\\\ell) for 90\\u2218/270\\u221890^{\\\\circ}/270^{\\\\circ} rotations.\\n\\n\\nThe primary motivation for this metric is to distinguish between \\u201cnear-misses\\u201d and total navigational failures.\\nBy measuring spatial displacement, we can quantify whether a model that failed the exact string match nonetheless moved in the correct direction or reached the vicinity of the goal.\\nThis provides a soft failure signal that string-based metrics like Accuracy or Prefix Accuracy cannot capture.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"4 Results\": \"\\n\\n4 Results\\n\\n\\n4.1 1-shot Inference\\n\\nFigure\\u00a03 summarizes the results in terms of accuracy and total token usage.\\nThe plot on the left of Figure\\u00a03 shows the accuracy as a function of the corridor length, \\u2113\\\\ell, for all tested models.\\nSimilarly to Shojaee et al. (2025), our results show approximately three regions in which the models behave according to different regimes: an easier region where corridor lengths are short, characterized by higher accuracy; an intermediate region characterized by a rapid decrease in accuracy as the length of the corridors increases and a harder region in which the models completely fail to return a correct plan.\\nThese regions are specific to each model.\\n\\n\\nCrucially, corridors are deep but narrow problems: many sequential steps (depth d\\u223c\\u2113d\\\\sim\\\\ell) with minimal branching.\\nIn such settings, a small per-step probability pwp_{w} of miscounting the size of the map compounds exponentially, yielding success probability \\u223c(1\\u2212pw)\\u2113\\\\sim(1-p_{w})^{\\\\ell}.\\nThis may explain the three-region performance curve we observe: short corridors tolerate occasional drift, producing a plateau of acceptable accuracy; intermediate lengths mark the onset of exponential decay, while long corridors see near-total collapse as cumulative errors dominate.\\nWe thus believe that the main reason LRMs cannot correctly plan in longer corridors is mainly due to internal counting representation.\\nIt was indeed shown in McCoy et al. (2024) that when asked to count individual characters, LLMs perform better with common characters than uncommon ones (like #).\\nThis counting failure can be interpreted through the lens of Lu et al. (2025) \\u201cwandering vs systematic exploration\\u201d framework: maintaining an accurate count over many positions is equivalent to maintaining correct state representations across a chain of transitions.\\n\\n\\nAs an observation, we report that GPT-5-mini displays an anomalous accuracy peak around \\u2113=50\\\\ell=50 which is however hardly explained by the model above.\\nWe believe this effect is likely due to memorization, but without access to internal states models this remains an hypothesis.\\n\\n\\nFigure\\u00a03 shows the number of output tokens as a function of the corridor length, \\u2113\\\\ell, filtering only for correctly solved Sokoban problems.\\nLinear regression analysis reveals that for each model, the number of output tokens for correctly predicted problems increases with the length of the corridor.\\nWe don\\u2019t observe the counterintuitive scaling mentioned by Shojaee et al. (2025) with models declining the request to do very long reasoning to solve complex problems.\\nInstead, we report the reasoning effort increasing almost linearly with problem complexity, with none of the three models declining our request early.\\n\\n\\nFigure 3: Accuracy and number of reasoning tokens for LRM experiment. Left: average accuracy. Error bars are computed as the 5th and 95th percentile of responses. Right: scaling behaviour of reasoning length against corridor length filtered for correct solutions only.\\n\\n\\nIn the linear regression analysis above, however only a small fraction of the variance is explained due to the noise of the measurements.\\nThis trend is observed only in the region where \\u2113<50\\\\ell<50, since for larger corridor\\u2019s lengths the number of correct predictions decreases significantly for all tested models.\\nMain parameters of the linear regression fit are collected in Table\\u00a02.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nModel\\nSlope\\n\\ud835\\udc11\\ud835\\udfd0\\\\mathbf{R^{2}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeepSeek R1\\n51.151.1\\n0.350.35\\n\\n\\nGPT-5-mini\\n29.829.8\\n0.620.62\\n\\n\\nGPT-oss 120B\\n39.439.4\\n0.400.40\\n\\n\\n\\nCorrect Answers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nModel\\nSlope\\n\\ud835\\udc11\\ud835\\udfd0\\\\mathbf{R^{2}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeepSeek R1\\n86.3\\n0.25\\n\\n\\nGPT-5-mini\\n55.2\\n0.14\\n\\n\\nGPT-oss 120B\\n85.9\\n0.12\\n\\n\\n\\nWrong Answers\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 2: Fit parameters associated to the linear regressions performed on Figure\\u00a04 (see below).\\n\\n\\nIn Figure\\u00a04 we further analyze the number of emitted tokens as a function of the corridor length parameter \\u2113\\\\ell, considering both correct and incorrect answers.\\nUnlike Shojaee et al. (2025) which observed a counterintuitive reduction in the reasoning effort for problems above a certain threshold of difficulty, we observe a steady increase in the number of output tokens.\\nWhat we found shows that the difficulty of a problem is not characterized by the decrease in the reasoning effort, but instead by the substantially higher variability in token counts of incorrect answers compared to correct ones.\\nThis suggests that when the model diverges from the correct reasoning trajectory, it can fail in multiple ways, whereas successful completions remain more concise and consistent, likely an effect of inductive bias of Group Reinforcement Policy Optimization (GRPO) post-training, where concise reasoning traces are preferred to lengthy ones (Sui et al., 2025).\\nTo quantify this effect, we fit a robust regression of completion tokens against corridor\\u2019s length for each model.\\nBoth slope and intercept appear model-specific: more efficient models, such as GPT-5-mini, show lower slopes and reduced variability across both correct and incorrect responses.\\nAnother relevant distinction can be made, highlighting differences in models\\u2019 calibration.\\nDeepSeek-R1 and GPT-5-mini display similar slopes and intercepts between correct and incorrect predictions, GPT-oss-120B instead reflect large differences in the regression parameters.\\nA recurrent behavior is that for longer corridors, LRMs often reach the maximum allowed number of output tokens.\\nAfter a qualitative inspection of the reasoning traces, we observed that the main reason this happens is that the models get stuck in repeating the same action or reasoning frame over and over until they reach the token limit.\\nWe report the reasoning traces for the interested user at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/sokoban_traces/\\n\\n\\nThis repetitive looping behavior exemplifies what Lu et al. (Lu et al., 2025) classify as unnecessary exploration and failure to maintain a visited-state set. In a systematic search, an agent would track which configurations (or reasoning states) have already been explored and avoid revisiting them. The token-limit exhaustion we observe suggests that LRMs lack such memory: they repeatedly propose the same moves or reasoning steps without recognizing the cycle.\\nThis is evidence of wandering rather than systematic planning: the model explores aimlessly rather than pruning redundant paths.\\nIn a corridor setting, where the state space is essentially linear, even a simple mental tape of visited positions would suffice to prevent loops; the inability to maintain it indicates a fundamental deficit in structured state tracking.\\n\\n\\nFigure 4: Number of completion tokens produced by each model as a function of corridor length. Separate linear regressions are fitted for correct and incorrect responses, with outliers excluded. A small jitter is added to the x-axis to improve visualization.\\n\\n\\nIn Figure\\u00a05 we analyze our data from the point of view of prefix accuracy and Manhattan distance.\\nThe metrics show a decreasing trend for all models that is similar to that represented in Figure\\u00a03.\\nSome patterns, like the peak at \\u2113=50\\\\ell=50 for GPT-5-mini and the increase in accuracy around the central region for DeepSeek R1, are further accentuated.\\nThis highlights that the main source of errors in most Sokoban problems is related to counting mistakes.\\nIn terms of Manhattan distance, the optimal solution would have distance one as the player and the goal are separated by the box.\\nHowever, as observed sometimes the player is positioned exactly on the goal, thus ignoring the spatial constraints of the problem.\\n\\n\\nThese violations, where the predicted sequence places the player on the goal position despite walls and box, are instances of what Lu et al. (2025) terms invalid exploration.\\nIn a valid state-transition graph, certain moves (e.g., walking through walls, teleporting over boxes) are inadmissible.\\nWhen a model proposes such transitions, it demonstrates that its internal representation does not faithfully track the game\\u2019s physics and its constraints.\\nLLMs hallucinate states unreachable under the true transition rules, producing reasoning traces that are syntactically plausible but structurally incoherent for the problem.\\nThe fact that even advanced reasoning models exhibit these errors underscores a core limitation: without explicit state-transition verification, test-time scaling cannot guarantee adherence to problem constraints and rules.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 5: Other useful metrics represented as functions of the corridor\\u2019s length.

here we outline the main constraints and threats to validity.\\nWe focus on one-box linear corridors, which test long-horizon counting and state maintenance rather than the full difficulty of multi-box Sokoban with deadlocks.\\nThus, the benchmark provides only a lower bound on planning ability.\\nFor evaluation, we use exact-plan validation against a reference generator.\\nAlthough this is stricter than necessary in general Sokoban, where multiple optimal plans may exist, it is suitable for corridors; future work will instead use solver-based verification to handle maps with multiple valid solutions.\\nWe also find sensitivity to prompt formatting, especially orientation-related effects such as the many newlines in vertical maps.\\nAlternative encodings, such as row/column numbered grids or other textual cues, may reduce this issue.\\nAnother variability source is model metadata and provider backends: although all calls go through one routing layer, backend implementations and model revisions can change over time.\\nWe log identifiers and dates, but some instability is inherent in API-based evaluations.\\nPretraining contamination is another concern; corridor rotations lower the chance that specific plans were memorized but do not eliminate it.\\nFinally, corridor tasks have limited external validity, since success or failure may not transfer to richer planning domains.\\nWe treat these settings mainly as a sanity check, with follow-up experiments planned to add obstacles, branching structures, and deadlocks.\\n\\n\\n\", \"Societal Impact\": \"\\nSocietal Impact\\n\\nThis paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of Machine Learning through clearer diagnostics of long-horizon planning.\\nWhile any benchmark could have indirect downstream effects by steering research agendas, we do not identify specific societal risks unique to this work beyond standard concerns about evaluation misuse.\\nWe therefore do not highlight any particular societal impacts at this time.\\n\\n\", \"Appendix A Prompts for 1-shot Inference Settings\": \"\\n\\nAppendix A Prompts for 1-shot Inference Settings\\n\\nIn this section we report the detailed prompts that we have used throughout our experiments with reasoning models alone.\\nPrompts are direct, no Chain of Thought elicited as it is known that it may hamper internal reasoning on LRMs.\\nA simple solved problem is provided as the 1-shot example.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSystem Prompt\\n\\n\\n\\u2b07\\nYou are an assistant that helps in solving assigned Sokoban games.\\n\\nYour task is to examine the provided Sokoban problem and find a solution.\\n\\nAll provided Sokoban problems are assigned in form of ASCII maps.\\n\\nThe mapping is the following:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2018\\u2018\\u2018\\n\\n @ - Player\\n\\n + - Player on Goal\\n\\n $ - Box\\n\\n * - Box on Goal\\n\\n . - Goal (Empty)\\n\\n # - Wall Brick\\n\\n\\u2018\\u2018\\u2018\\n\\n\\n\\nThe game is solved when the box is pushed into the goal position, hence when the position of \\u2018$\\u2018 coincides with the position of \\u2018.\\u2018.\\n\\nThe player can move in all the empty spaces of the ASCII map while respecting the walls.\\n\\nWhen the player is adjacent to a box, the player can push the box into an adjacent empty space.\\n\\nAfter pushing a box, the new position of the agent will be the position of the box before the push.\\n\\nThe player cannot pull the box, only push it.\\n\\nThe actions you can perform in the game are:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2018\\u2018\\u2018\\n\\n L - Move Left\\n\\n R - Move Right\\n\\n U - Move Up\\n\\n D - Move Down\\n\\n\\u2018\\u2018\\u2018\\n\\n\\n\\nAll provided problems CAN be solved.\\n\\nYou must give your solution in form of a sequence of allowed actions, separated by commas.\\n\\nYou must give only the sequence of actions, without any additional text or explanation.\\n\\nYou must enclose your solution inside the tags <plan> </plan>.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following is an example of a Sokoban problem and its solution:\\n\\n\\n\\nProblem:\\n\\n\\n\\n#####\\n\\n#@ ##\\n\\n## $ ##\\n\\n # #\\n\\n ##. ##\\n\\n ## #\\n\\n ###\\n\\n\\n\\nSolution:\\n\\n\\n\\n<plan>\\n\\nR,R,D,D\\n\\n</plan>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUser Prompt\\n\\n\\n\\u2b07\\nHere is the Sokoban problem to solve, enclosed in triple backtics:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2018\\u2018\\u2018\\n\\n{{ sokoban_map }}\\n\\n\\u2018\\u2018\\u2018\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"Appendix B Prompts for LLM-Modulo Settings\": \"\\n\\nAppendix B Prompts for LLM-Modulo Settings\\n\\nIn this section, we show the system prompt we used for the experiments on LLM-Modulo settings.\\nThe user prompt remains the same as shown in Appendix\\u00a0A.

At any particular instance of time the deep researcher stores the context of the previous research done and revisits them to decide upon:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nThe next (potentially un-explored) area to be researched.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nRefining the Research Plan if needed.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\n\\nDetermining the percentage Research Progress.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe continue the research process until we have hit a satisfactory threshold of research progress or we have exhausted the maximum retries. The Deep Researcher has an LLM-as-a-judge which analyzes the research performed and decides on the percentage of the research progress. If the researcher crosses the threshold of 90% progress, the research process is halted and a research report is generated.\\n\\n\\nWe generate a research report in a single-shot by an LLM Agent acting as a report writer. The Report Writer Agent has access to the entire research context on the topic and utilises it to generate a Research Report in a single shot. Unlike Google\\u2019s TTD-DR (Test-Time Diffusion) [4] which performs Report-level Denoising inspired by the sampling process in Diffusion models to where they continuously refine the noisy generated initial report iteratively.\\n\\n\", \"2 Sequential Refinement approach vs Parallel Scaling\": \"\\n\\n2 Sequential Refinement approach vs Parallel Scaling\\n\\nThe development of Deep Research Agents (DRAs) has seen the emergence of two primary paradigms for handling complex, multi-faceted research tasks: Parallel Scaling and Sequential Refinement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nParallel Scaling - Efficiency and Its Limitations: Parallel scaling, as implemented in architectures like GPT Researcher [2] and our previous work, Static-DRA [6], focuses on decomposing a research topic into multiple independent sub-topics. These sub-topics are then investigated concurrently by parallel execution agents. While this approach offers significant advantages in terms of reduced latency and stable performance through horizontal scaling, it often suffers from a \\u201dsiloed knowledge\\u201d problem. Because each agent operates within the vacuum of its specific sub-task, the system lacks a holistic \\u201dGlobal Context\\u201d. This isolation makes it difficult for the model to recognize overlapping information, avoid redundant search queries, or make intelligent, real-time modifications to the research plan based on discoveries made in other branches.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nSequential Refinement - Global Context and Dynamic Adaptation: In contrast, the Sequential Refinement approach leverages the iterative nature of the research process. Google\\u2019s TTD-DR (Test-Time Diffusion) [4] architecture exemplifies this by performing \\u201dReport-level Denoising,\\u201d where an initial draft is continuously refined through sequential iterations inspired by diffusion models. Our Deep Researcher advances this paradigm by shifting the focus from report refinement to Sequential Research Plan Refinement. In this model, the agent maintains a centralized Global Research Context - a comprehensive memory of every search trajectory and artifact gathered. By building each research chain explicitly upon previous attempts, the agent can \\u201dlook back\\u201d at its progress and reason about which areas remain unexplored. This allows for dynamic plan refinement, enabling the agent to pivot its strategy at runtime, add unforeseen sub-topics, or terminate redundant paths.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe superiority of sequential scaling is supported by recent findings in \\u201dThe Sequential Edge\\u201d (Chopra 2025) [7] paper, which demonstrates that sequential scaling consistently outperforms the parallel self-consistency paradigm in 95.6% of configurations, with accuracy gains of up to 46.7%. This is attributed to the model\\u2019s ability to reason with a fuller, more integrated context rather than disparate fragments.\\n\\n\\nBy adopting this sequential approach, our Deep Researcher achieved a score of 46.21 on the DeepResearch Bench [1], outperforming leading deep research agents such as Claude Researcher [8], Perplexity Research [13], Grok Deeper Search [17] and many others in the leaderboard [10]. Our architecture ensures that the final One-Shot Report Generation is informed by a unified narrative and high fact density, producing the depth required for PhD-level research.\\n\\n\", \"3 Deep Researcher Design\": \"\\n\\n3 Deep Researcher Design\\n\\n\\n3.1 High Level Design\\n\\nThe high level design of the Deep Researcher includes multiple modules working together to carry out the deep research on a given topic. The design is demonstrated in Figure 2.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: Deep Researcher - High Level Design\\n\\n\\nThe research methodology is structured as a series of sequential iterations, wherein each successive phase leverages findings from previous cycles to facilitate informed decision-making regarding targeted research areas and necessary plan refinements. The summary of the research process is demonstrated in the steps mentioned below.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nStep 1 - Research Plan Curation: The research topic is provided to the Planning agent that curates a research plan for the provided topic. The plan comprises detailed steps to take in order to carry out the research.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nStep 2 - Generate Search Query: The curated plan is read by the Search agent that generates a search query. The agent also reads the global context to understand what all has been already researched and intelligently curates a search query.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\n\\nStep 3 - Answer Search Query: The search query from the previous step is answered by the Search Agent. At this step the agent utilises a Web Search tool to gather recent events and updates regarding the query. The agent also incorporates the Candidate Crossover algorithm to improve the answer generated for the query. The search query and the answer is then added to the global context.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.\\n\\nStep 4 - Research Plan Reflection: The Planning agent reads the current research plan and the global context to decide whether to update the currently followed research plan or not. The agent also decides on what changes to make in the plan if at all needed.\\n\\n\\n\\n5.\\n\\nStep 5 - Research Plan Update (maybe): The Planning agent takes on the plan reflection input from the previous step and makes the necessary updates in the Research Plan if suggested in the previous step. If there\\u2019s no change needed, the existing plan is followed.\\n\\n\\n\\n6.\\n\\nStep 6 - Analyze Research Progress: The Planning agent reads the research plan and the global context to analyze the current state of the research progress. If the research progress has crossed the 90% threshold benchmark, then the research process is ended. Otherwise the research loop is continued again from Step 2.\\n\\n\\n\\n7.\\n\\nStep 7 - One Shot Report generation: Once the research loop ends, we perform one-shot report generation by an LLM agent acting as a report writer. The agent is provided with the current research plan and the global context to write the research report in one go.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe subsequent sections provide a comprehensive and detailed examination of the aforementioned procedural stages.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2 Candidate Crossover algorithm\\n\\nWe implement a Candidate Crossover algorithm that is integrated into Step 3, the phase in which the Search Agent conducts research for a specified query. This algorithm enhances the agent\\u2019s efficiency by deploying multiple candidates to investigate the same query in parallel. Upon completion of their respective investigations, the findings are synthesized through a crossover process to generate a comprehensive and finalized research response. The algorithm is demonstrated in Figure 3.\\n\\n\\nFigure 3: Deep Researcher - Candidate Crossover algorithm\\n\\n\\nOur Candidate Crossover algorithm is inspired by the Self-Evolution algorithm introduced in Google\\u2019s Deep Researcher with Test Time Diffusion (TTD-DR) [4] paper. Each candidate is a unit LLM agent with varied configuration settings. To facilitate the exploration of a large search space during inference, we initialize n candidates (in this paper all research topics were evaluated on n=3 candidates), each with access to a unit LLM Agent having n different configurations of temperature and top_k parameters respectively. By providing each Candidate with varied parameters, we allow each of them to attend to a different space at inference time. These candidates are provided with a search query and additional artifacts obtained from the Web Search tool, and are tasked to generate concise answers retaining all facts and numbers. We use Tavily [14] for web search and aim to receive top 5 search results for a topic from the web. We also make sure to have only relevant web search results with us for writing a report for the research topic. The Tavily Web Search tool [15] provides a score field for every search result returned which defines \\u201cthe relevance score of the search result\\u201d. We have a threshold score value set to 30% which filters out any search result whose score is less than the threshold score.\\n\\n\\nLater during the Cross-over, we combine the information by merging the answers of all the candidates, consolidating the best information from their respective evolutionary paths to curate a final research response and produce superior context for the main report generation process.\\n\\n\\nTTD-DR\\u2019s Self Evolution algorithm can be summarized in the following steps:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nStep 1 - Initial States: LLM Agent units generate diverse output variants (e.g., search query answers) by sampling with varied parameters like temperature and top_k to broaden the search space.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nStep 2 - Environmental Feedback: An LLM-as-a-judge uses auto-raters to evaluate variants on metrics like Helpfulness and provides textual critiques for improvement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nStep 3 - Revision Step: Variants are iteratively revised based on scores and feedback until stopping criteria are met.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nStep 4 - Cross-over: Multiple revised variants are merged into a single high-quality output, consolidating the best information for the final report.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe did not include the Environmental Feedback (Step 2) and the Revision Steps (Step 3) present in the algorithm to reduce the latency of the Report Generation process and inference time complexity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3 Agent\\u2019s Memory: Global Research Context\\n\\nThe Global Research Context serves as the centralized memory repository for the Deep Researcher, enabling a more cohesive sequential refinement model. This module stores the comprehensive history of the research process, including:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nSearch Trajectories: Maintains a detailed log of every search query generated by the Search agent and the corresponding answers produced by the Search Agent with Candidate Crossover algorithm.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nContextual Artifacts: Houses raw data, facts, and numbers gathered from Web Search tools, ensuring that the final report writer has access to the primary evidence discovered during the loop.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nBy maintaining this global state, the system provides the model with the \\u201dglobal context\\u201d necessary to reason across previously explored areas. This prevents the Search agent from drafting redundant search queries and allows the Planning agent to intelligently determine the percentage of research progress based on the totality of information gathered. The Global Research Context is particularly vital during Step 4 (Research Plan Reflection) and Step 5 (Research Plan Update). By accessing this centralized memory, the Planning agent can perform a methodical process of reasoning that synthesizes low-level search results into higher-level insights. Specifically, the importance of the Global Context in these stages includes:\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nAvoiding Redundancy: The Planning agent reviews the existing search trajectories to ensure that subsequent plan updates do not repeat previously explored queries, optimizing the efficiency of the research loop.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\n\\nDynamic Plan Refinement: Access to the full research history (global context) enables the agent to reason about current progress and make intelligent, real-time modifications to the plan based on evidence found, rather than adhering to a rigid, pre-defined structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.\\n\\nInformed Decision-Making: The model uses the \\u201dglobal context\\u201d to decide which areas remain unexplored, ensuring that the updated research plan targets the most relevant and high-impact information gaps.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUnlike parallel architectures that isolate sub-topic research presented in Static DRA [link] and GPT Researcher (link), the global research context ensures that Step 7 (One-Shot Report Generation) is informed by a holistic understanding of the research topic, leading to more insightful and integrated final reports.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4 Sequential Research Plan Refinement via Reflection\\n\\nThe Sequential Research Plan Refinement via Reflection module is the core mechanism that enables our Deep Researcher to adapt its investigative strategy dynamically. Unlike static research architectures that follow a rigid, pre-defined path, this module empowers the Planning agent to evaluate its current progress and pivot based on the information discovered.\\n\\n\\nThe refinement process is executed in two distinct phases:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nReflection Phase (Step 4): The Planning agent performs a critical review of the existing research plan against the Global Research Context. It assesses whether the current search results satisfy the initial research goals or if new, unforeseen sub-topics have emerged that require deeper investigation. This \\u201dlook back\\u201d capability allows the agent to identify gaps in knowledge that a parallel approach might overlook.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nUpdate Phase (Step 5): If the reflection phase identifies a need for adjustment, the Planning agent modifies the research plan at runtime. These modifications may include adding new research steps, re-prioritizing existing tasks, or terminating paths that have proven to be redundant.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis sequential approach leverages findings from previous cycles to facilitate informed decision-making. By building each research chain upon the previous attempt, we align with findings from the Sequential Edge [7] paper, which suggests that sequential scaling consistently outperforms parallel self-consistency by allowing models to reason with fuller, more integrated context. This ensures that the research trajectory remains efficient, avoiding the \\u201dsiloed\\u201d knowledge problem common in parallel scaling architectures like GPT Researcher [2] or Static-DRA [6].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.5 One Shot Report Generation\\n\\nThe One Shot Report Generation module (Step 7) serves as the final synthesis stage of the research process. Unlike architectures such as Google\\u2019s TTD-DR (Test Time Diffusion - Deep Research) [4], which utilize a \\u201dReport-level Denoising\\u201d process to iteratively refine a noisy initial draft through multiple diffusion-inspired steps, our system employs a single, comprehensive generation phase.\\n\\n\\nIn this stage, a specialized LLM agent, designated as the Report Writer, is granted full access to the Global Research Context and the final, refined Research Plan. This access ensures that the agent can draw upon the entire trajectory of search queries, synthesized answers from the Candidate Crossover algorithm, and raw contextual artifacts such as facts and figures gathered during the sequential iterations. By processing this holistic dataset in a single inference pass, the Report Writer can:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nIntegrate Complex Information: Synthesize findings from disparate research branches into a cohesive narrative without the \\u201dsiloed\\u201d knowledge gaps common in parallel scaling architectures.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nMaintain Narrative Consistency: Ensure a unified tone and logical flow throughout the document, as the entire report is generated with the same global perspective.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\n\\nEnsure Fact Density: Utilize the centralized memory to include specific numbers, dates, and evidence discovered during the search phases, producing a detailed report suitable for PhD-level research topics.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis approach prioritizes computational efficiency and reduced latency by avoiding the multiple refinement cycles, while still maintaining high output quality by leveraging the high-fidelity context built during the sequential reflection phases.\\n\\n\\n\", \"4 Evaluation\": \"\\n\\n4 Evaluation\\n\\nOur Deep Researcher is evaluated against the globally recognized DeepResearch Bench [9]. As the primary benchmark for general-purpose Deep Research Agents (DRAs), it comprises 100 doctoral-level research tasks across 22 distinct fields.

novel Deep Researcher architecture, which shifts the paradigm from latency-optimized parallel scaling to an accuracy-driven sequential refinement model. The system\\u2019s core innovations are the Sequential Research Plan Refinement via Reflection and the Candidates Crossover algorithm. Sequential refinement enables the agent to maintain a centralized Global Research Context, allowing it to dynamically adapt its research plan, avoid redundant searches, and overcome the \\u201dsiloed knowledge\\u201d problem inherent in parallel architectures like Static-DRA and GPT Researcher. The Candidates Crossover algorithm further optimized search efficiency by deploying multiple LLM agents with varied parameters to explore a larger search space, with their findings synthesized for a comprehensive final response.\\n\\n\\nThe effectiveness of this approach was demonstrated through rigorous evaluation on the DeepResearch Bench, a global benchmark of 100 doctoral-level research tasks. Powered by the gemini-2.5-pro model, our Deep Researcher achieved a superior overall score of 46.21, significantly surpassing several leading deep research agents. These results reinforce the critical finding that sequential scaling consistently outperforms the parallel self-consistency paradigm, validating the system\\u2019s ability to generate highly detailed, fact-dense reports suitable for PhD-level research using a One Shot Report Generation process that maintains computational efficiency.\\n\\n\"}, \"bibliography\": {\"[1]\": \"\\n[1]\\nM.

Recent systems  (lu2024aiscientist; yamada2025aiscientistv2; gottweis_towards_2025) demonstrate that LLM-based agents can autonomously execute an end-to-end research loop, including literature review, code generation, experiment execution, and manuscript drafting. These results suggest that automated scientific discovery is becoming practically feasible and that LLM-based agents are approaching a level of functional completeness required for autonomous research (jin_agentreview_2024; sahu_reviewertoo_2025; ajith2024litsearch; zhang_noveltybench_2025; zhang2026opennovelty).\\n\\n\\nDespite this progress, existing systems remain constrained by a fundamental inefficiency in their execution paradigm, which limits their scalability and robustness in practice. In particular, most current research agents (wang_openhands_2025; yang_swe-agent_2024; mitchener_kosmos_2025; luo2025llm4sr) rely on an on-the-spot computation strategy, where nearly all information acquisition, reasoning, and synthesis are performed online at runtime. Under this paradigm, each new research attempt requires the agent to dynamically retrieve large volumes of scientific literature, read and summarize long and heterogeneous documents in real time, and explore a broad space of candidate methods and experimental designs through open-ended generation and trial-and-error. As a result, the cost of producing a single effective scientific discovery remains substantial. For example, a complete execution of the overall pipeline often requires several hours and, in some cases, up to 15 hours to progress from ideation to experimentation (lu2024aiscientist). Similarly, in (schmidgall_agent_2025), literature review and experimental planning alone account for a significant portion of total inference time and place heavy demands on the language model\\u2019s ability to maintain coherent reasoning over long contexts. More importantly, this runtime-centric design repeatedly forces the model to re-process large volumes of unstructured and partially redundant information, even when much of the underlying scientific knowledge is already well established, thereby increasing computational overhead and exacerbating the risk of hallucination and reasoning errors (wang2025repomaster; shin_mind_2025).\\n\\n\\nTo address the efficiency and reliability limitations of existing autonomous research agents, we propose Idea2Story, a scientific discovery framework that explicitly separates offline knowledge construction from online research generation, with the goal of reducing repeated reasoning over scientific literature and alleviating the context window bottleneck of large language models. Most current systems rely on runtime-centric execution, where agents repeatedly retrieve, read, summarize, and reason over large collections of highly overlapping papers for each new research attempt, resulting in substantial computational cost and prolonged execution time. Idea2Story mitigates this inefficiency by shifting literature understanding from online reasoning to an offline stage. In the offline phase, the system periodically collects recently accepted, peer-reviewed papers together with their full review feedback, extracts core methodological units and research patterns, and organizes these units and their observed composition relations into a continuously updated structured knowledge graph. This knowledge graph serves as a compact and reusable representation of established scientific methods and their empirical compatibility, replacing repeated processing of raw documents at runtime. Building on this offline knowledge infrastructure, Idea2Story performs online research generation by aligning underspecified user research intents with existing research paradigms encoded in the knowledge graph. Rather than relying on open-ended generation and trial-and-error, the system retrieves high-quality research patterns as structured compositions of method units, which act as stable methodological blueprints for downstream experimental design and execution. Guided by these validated research patterns, Idea2Story conducts feasibility-driven experimentation and ultimately generates a complete, submission-ready paper in an end-to-end manner.\\n\\n\\nFigure 1:  Overview of the two-stage framework in Idea2Story. The offline stage constructs a structured knowledge graph by extracting and organizing reusable method units from a curated paper corpus. The online stage retrieves and composes research patterns from the knowledge graph to ground underspecified user intent into concrete and coherent research directions.\\n\\n\\nOur work makes the following contributions to autonomous scientific discovery :\\n(1) We introduce Idea2Story, a framework that formalizes autonomous research as a\\npre-computation\\u2013driven process, where scientific knowledge is extracted, structured, and\\nmaintained in a continuously updated methodological knowledge graph, addressing the inefficiency and\\nunreliability of runtime-centric research agents. (2) We propose a knowledge-grounded planning and execution pipeline that alleviates the context window bottleneck and reduces repeated runtime reasoning over literature by converting paper reading into retrieval over a pre-built knowledge graph. (3) We conduct preliminary empirical studies and comparative evaluations, demonstrating that Idea2Story can produce several high-quality research demos and establishing the practical feasibility of the proposed paradigm in an end-to-end setting.\\n\\n\", \"2 Related Work\": \"\\n\\n2 Related Work\\n\\n\\n2.1 Autonomous Scientific Discovery\\n\\nRecent advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven growing interest in autonomous scientific\\ndiscovery agents that aim to automate the full research lifecycle, from code generation to experimental\\nexecution  (hu_controlled_2026; zhang2025evolving; lin_se-agent_2025). Early systems such as The AI Scientist (v1) (lu2024aiscientist) demonstrate the\\nviability of end-to-end automation but rely heavily on manually crafted code templates and largely\\nlinear exploration workflows, which restrict discovery depth and adaptability. Later approaches, including\\nThe AI Scientist-v2 (yamada2025aiscientistv2) and Kosmos (mitchener_kosmos_2025), reduce reliance on\\nexplicit template through the incorporation of agentic tree search and experiment management agents, enabling iterative and multi-round exploration.\\n\\n\\nIn research ideation, LLM-generated ideas are often perceived as highly novel during initial screening; however, prior studies (si2024can) uncover a critical paradox whereby such ideas tend to underperform after implementation relative to human-generated ideas, indicating limited feasibility and practical\\nutility. As more ideas are generated, LLM outputs exhibit growing similarity, leading to diminished meaningful diversity. Similar limitations have also been observed in research evaluation and peer\\nreview (liang2024can; xu2025can; thakkar_can_2025; zhang2026opennovelty). Existing AI-based reviewers display systematic blind\\nspots: shin_mind_2025 shows that LLM reviewers place disproportionate\\nemphasis on technical correctness while undervaluing novelty, deviating from human\\nexpert judgment, while sahu_reviewertoo_2025 demonstrates that AI reviewers\\nstruggle to distinguish fine-grained acceptance categories and are susceptible to sycophancy, with\\nreview scores increasing unreasonably after exposure to author rebuttals. Although recent approaches\\nsuch as AgentReview (jin_agentreview_2024) seek to mitigate these deficiencies by simulating\\ndiverse reviewer roles, automated evaluation systems remain less reliable than human experts in\\nidentifying robust accept/reject decision boundaries.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2.2 LLM-Driven Agents\\n\\nLLM-driven agents still struggle to interact effectively with complex real-world environments.\\nDespite their strong generative capabilities, many existing systems\\u2014such as OpenHands (wang_openhands_2025)\\nand SWE-Agent (yang_swe-agent_2024)\\u2014exhibit limited performance when applied to realistic\\ncodebases. These limitations largely stem from insufficient reasoning over hierarchical dependencies\\nand structural constraints, as well as the inherent restrictions imposed by finite context windows.\\nAs a result, LLM-driven agents achieve relatively low task completion rates on challenging benchmarks\\nsuch as MLE-bench (chan_mlebench_2024) and SciCode (tian_scicode_2024).\\nRepoMaster (wang2025repomaster) further identifies inadequate modeling of codebase structure,\\nincluding function call graphs and module dependency graphs, as a key bottleneck for LLM-driven agents\\noperating in large and complex environments.\\n\\n\\nBeyond execution limitations, LLM-driven agents also exhibit notable deficiencies in scientific rigor\\nand evaluative judgment. When tasked with autonomous assessment, these agents are prone to hallucination and overconfidence. For instance, Agent Laboratory (schmidgall_agent_2025) reports that automated evaluations produced by LLM-driven agents substantially overestimate paper quality compared to human reviewers. Evaluations of Kosmos (mitchener_kosmos_2025) further reveal a tendency to invent opaque quantitative metrics and to conflate statistical significance with scientific value, leading to weak interpretability of experimental conclusions. Moreover, long-horizon autonomous execution exacerbates these issues by introducing behavioral\\ndrift (arike2025tech), where LLM-driven agents gradually deviate from intended research trajectories or generate overly strong and insufficiently justified claims (lu2024aiscientist; schmidgall2025agent; baek_researchagent_2025; hong_metagpt_2023; wu_autogen_2023; lin_se-agent_2025; hu_controlled_2026). This drift further undermines reliability and highlights the\\nneed for stronger structural grounding and validation mechanisms in LLM-based autonomous research\\nsystems.\\n\\n\\n\", \"3 General Idea Generation\": \"\\n\\n3 General Idea Generation\\n\\nIdea2Story is designed to interact with users through high-level and often informal research ideas\\nthat reflect human intuition rather than fully specified technical plans. The system transforms\\nsuch underspecified inputs into structured and academically grounded research directions through\\na two-stage paradigm that separates offline knowledge construction from online research generation:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nOffline Knowledge Construction.\\nIn the offline stage, Idea2Story builds a reusable methodological foundation from existing\\nscientific literature. This includes curating a large-scale paper pool from peer-reviewed\\nvenues, extracting reusable method units that capture core methodological contributions, and\\norganizing these units into a structured knowledge graph that encodes their semantic and\\ncompositional relations. The resulting knowledge graph serves as a persistent repository of\\nmethodological abstractions, decoupling literature understanding from runtime reasoning.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nOnline Research Generation.\\nIn the online stage, Idea2Story grounds user-provided research ideas through retrieval and\\ncomposition over the pre-built knowledge graph. Given an informal user idea, the system aligns\\nthe input with existing research paradigms, retrieves relevant research patterns, and composes\\ncompatible method units into concrete research directions. These instantiated patterns are\\nfurther refined through a review-guided process that iteratively evaluates and revises them with\\nrespect to novelty, methodological soundness, and conceptual coherence. The refined research\\npatterns then serve as structured blueprints for subsequent planning, feasibility-driven\\nexperimentation, and end-to-end paper generation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1 Offline Knowledge Construction\\n\\nThe offline knowledge construction stage aims to distill reusable methodological structure from\\nexisting scientific literature and to organize it in a form that can be efficiently accessed during\\nonline research generation. Instead of performing document-level reasoning at runtime, Idea2Story\\npre-computes a structured representation of prior work that captures both methodological\\nabstractions and their observed compatibility in accepted research. This stage consists of three\\nmain components: (i) constructing a curated paper pool from peer-reviewed venues, (ii) extracting\\ncore method units that represent reusable methodological contributions, and (iii) organizing these\\nunits and their composition relations into a structured knowledge graph. Together, these components\\nform a persistent methodological memory that decouples literature understanding from downstream\\nidea grounding and research generation.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1.1 Paper Pool Construction\\n\\nWe construct a paper pool from accepted machine learning papers and their associated peer reviews\\ncollected from top-tier conferences. Let \\ud835\\udc9e={NeurIPS,ICLR}\\\\mathcal{C}=\\\\{\\\\text{NeurIPS},\\\\text{ICLR}\\\\} denote the\\nset of venues considered, and let \\ud835\\udcaf\\\\mathcal{T} denote the most recent three-year time window.\\nThe resulting paper pool is defined as\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udcab={p\\u2223p\\u200b\\u00a0is an accepted paper from\\u00a0\\u200bc\\u2208\\ud835\\udc9e\\u200b\\u00a0during\\u00a0\\u200b\\ud835\\udcaf},\\\\mathcal{P}=\\\\{\\\\,p\\\\mid p\\\\text{ is an accepted paper from }c\\\\in\\\\mathcal{C}\\\\text{ during }\\\\mathcal{T}\\\\,\\\\},\\n\\n\\n\\nwhich consists of approximately 5,000 papers from NeurIPS and 8,000 papers from ICLR. For each paper p\\u2208\\ud835\\udcabp\\\\in\\\\mathcal{P}, we retain the full textual content\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc31p=(titlep,abstractp,bodyp),\\\\mathbf{x}_{p}=(\\\\text{title}_{p},\\\\text{abstract}_{p},\\\\text{body}_{p}),\\n\\n\\n\\ntogether with its associated review artifacts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc2bp={comments,ratings,confidence scores,meta-reviews}.\\\\mathbf{r}_{p}=\\\\{\\\\text{comments},\\\\text{ratings},\\\\text{confidence scores},\\\\text{meta-reviews}\\\\}.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis yields a temporally aligned corpus that jointly captures research contributions and evaluation\\nsignals.\\n\\n\\nTo protect privacy, we apply an anonymization function \\ud835\\udc9c\\u200b(\\u22c5)\\\\mathcal{A}(\\\\cdot) that removes all\\nauthor- and reviewer-identifying information, including names, affiliations, email addresses, and\\nexplicit identity references. In addition, we apply a safety filtering function\\n\\u2131\\u200b(\\u22c5)\\\\mathcal{F}(\\\\cdot) to review content to remove toxic or abusive language and personal attacks.\\nThe final stored representation of each paper is given by\\n\\n\\n\\np~=\\u2131\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc9c\\u200b(p)),\\\\tilde{p}=\\\\mathcal{F}(\\\\mathcal{A}(p)),\\n\\n\\n\\nresulting in a de-identified paper pool\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udcab~={p~\\u2223p\\u2208\\ud835\\udcab},\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}}=\\\\{\\\\,\\\\tilde{p}\\\\mid p\\\\in\\\\mathcal{P}\\\\,\\\\},\\n\\n\\n\\nwhich preserves technical content and review feedback while minimizing exposure to private or\\nharmful information.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1.2 Method Unit Extraction\\n\\nBased on the de-identified paper pool \\ud835\\udcab~\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}}, we define an automated extraction\\nprocedure that identifies the core methodological contributions of each paper in a structured and\\nreusable form. Formally, we model method unit extraction as a mapping\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2130:p~\\u2192\\ud835\\udcb0p={up(1),\\u2026,up(Kp)},\\\\mathcal{E}:\\\\tilde{p}\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathcal{U}_{p}=\\\\{u_{p}^{(1)},\\\\dots,u_{p}^{(K_{p})}\\\\},\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere p~\\u2208\\ud835\\udcab~\\\\tilde{p}\\\\in\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}} denotes a single paper and \\ud835\\udcb0p\\\\mathcal{U}_{p} is a small set\\nof method units that capture its essential technical ideas.\\n\\n\\nAs illustrated in Figure 2, the extraction procedure leverages the standardized structure of\\nacademic papers and analyzes different sections to collect complementary methodological signals.\\nLet \\ud835\\udc31p=(introp,methodp,expp)\\\\mathbf{x}_{p}=(\\\\text{intro}_{p},\\\\text{method}_{p},\\\\text{exp}_{p}) denote the partition of a paper\\ninto its introduction, method, and experiments sections. The introduction is used to identify the\\nhigh-level research motivation and the precise problem formulation, the method section provides\\nsignals about core technical mechanisms such as modeling assumptions, learning objectives, model\\narchitectures, and optimization strategies, and the experiments section reflects how these\\nmechanisms are instantiated and evaluated in practice. By jointly aggregating information from\\nthese sections, the extractor isolates method units that correspond to the primary algorithmic or\\nmodeling contributions of the paper, rather than surface-level experimental details.\\n\\n\\nWe define a method unit u\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb0pu\\\\in\\\\mathcal{U}_{p} as a self-contained description of how a research\\nproblem is formulated or solved, abstracted away from specific implementation choices and\\nexperimental configurations. Elements that primarily involve dataset selection, hyperparameter\\ntuning, or engineering-level optimizations are excluded unless they induce substantive changes to\\nthe problem formulation, model structure, or learning objective. In practice, most papers yield one\\nor a small number of method units. Each extracted unit is further normalized into structured\\nmethodological attributes, including atomic meta-methods, which correspond to indivisible\\nmethodological elements, and composition-level patterns, which describe how multiple method\\nunits are combined within a single paper.\\n\\n\\nAfter extracting method units for all papers, we represent each paper p\\u2208\\ud835\\udcab~p\\\\in\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}}\\nby a vector embedding derived from its associated method units. Formally, let\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc33p=g\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb0p),\\\\mathbf{z}_{p}=g(\\\\mathcal{U}_{p}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udcb0p\\\\mathcal{U}_{p} denotes the set of extracted method units for paper pp and\\ng\\u200b(\\u22c5)g(\\\\cdot) is an embedding function that maps a set of method units to a fixed-dimensional\\nrepresentation.\\n\\n\\nTo induce higher-level research patterns, we first apply a nonlinear dimensionality reduction\\noperator\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc32p=UMAP\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc33p),\\\\mathbf{y}_{p}=\\\\mathrm{UMAP}(\\\\mathbf{z}_{p}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhich projects the high-dimensional embeddings into a lower-dimensional space while preserving\\nlocal semantic neighborhoods. We then perform density-based clustering on the reduced\\nrepresentations using DBSCAN, yielding a partition\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9e={C1,\\u2026,CM},\\\\mathcal{C}=\\\\{C_{1},\\\\dots,C_{M}\\\\},\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere each cluster Cm\\u2282\\ud835\\udcab~C_{m}\\\\subset\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}} corresponds to a coherent research pattern.\\n\\n\\nThese induced clusters serve as higher-level abstractions over individual papers, capturing\\nrecurring methodological structures that are reused across the literature. The resulting research\\npatterns form the basis for subsequent retrieval and composition.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2:  Offline knowledge graph construction in Idea2Story. Academic papers and their associated review artifacts are first anonymized and safety-filtered, then deconstructed into layered methodological representations. These layers capture complementary aspects of a paper, including its core research idea, domain context, high-level story skeleton, and packaging actions. The extracted elements are normalized into atomic method units and meta-methods, which are connected through composition and similarity relations. Reviewer feedback is incorporated as additional signals to refine relations and validate abstractions. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1.3 Knowledge Graph Construction\\n\\nBuilding on the extracted method units, we organize reusable methodological components into a\\nstructured knowledge graph that supports systematic method discovery and composition. While\\nindividual method units capture isolated algorithmic or modeling ideas, effective research methods\\nin practice typically arise from structured combinations of multiple method units. The knowledge\\ngraph provides a unified representation that explicitly encodes canonicalized method units,\\nmeta-methods, and their empirically observed composition relations in prior work.\\n\\n\\nFormally, we define the knowledge graph as a directed graph\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udca2=(\\ud835\\udcb1,\\u2130),\\\\mathcal{G}=(\\\\mathcal{V},\\\\mathcal{E}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere each node v\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb1v\\\\in\\\\mathcal{V} corresponds to a canonicalized method unit or a meta-method.\\nCanonicalization groups semantically similar method units across the corpus into shared\\nmeta-method abstractions, reducing surface-level variation while preserving core methodological\\nintent. As a result, nodes in the graph represent atomic or minimally indivisible methodological\\nelements that are reused across papers.\\n\\n\\nEdges in the graph encode composition relations between method units. For a given paper\\np\\u2208\\ud835\\udcab~p\\\\in\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}} with extracted method unit set \\ud835\\udcb0p\\\\mathcal{U}_{p}, we add directed edges\\nbetween pairs of method units (ui,uj)\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb0p\\u00d7\\ud835\\udcb0p(u_{i},u_{j})\\\\in\\\\mathcal{U}_{p}\\\\times\\\\mathcal{U}_{p} to indicate that\\nthey are jointly instantiated as part of the same methodological pipeline. These edges capture\\nempirical evidence of method compatibility observed in prior work, reflecting how different\\nmethod units are combined in practice rather than hypothetical or manually specified relations.\\n\\n\\nAggregating composition relations across the full corpus yields a graph structure that encodes both\\nmethodological abstraction and empirical compatibility. In particular, the graph captures two\\ncomplementary levels of structure: (i) reusable methodological elements represented as\\ncanonicalized method units and meta-methods, and (ii) composition constraints induced from\\nco-occurrence statistics in accepted papers. This separation allows Idea2Story to reason about\\nmethods at a higher level of abstraction than individual papers, while remaining grounded in\\nobserved research practice.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2 Online Research Generation.\\n\\nGiven a target research objective, Idea2Story treats method discovery as a graph-based retrieval and\\ncomposition problem over \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G}. The system retrieves relevant subgraphs and composes\\ncompatible method units by following connectivity constraints in the graph, producing candidate\\nresearch patterns that correspond to structured combinations of method units. These research\\npatterns serve as high-level methodological blueprints that bridge abstract research intent and\\nconcrete experimental design, enabling downstream planning, feasibility analysis, and end-to-end\\npaper generation.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2.1 Research Pattern Retrieval\\n\\nGiven a user-provided research idea expressed in natural language, we formulate research pattern\\nidentification as a structured retrieval problem over the knowledge graph \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G}. Let\\nqq denote the input research idea, and let \\ud835\\udc9e={C1,\\u2026,CM}\\\\mathcal{C}=\\\\{C_{1},\\\\dots,C_{M}\\\\} denote the set of\\nresearch patterns induced from the paper corpus. The goal is to rank patterns in \\ud835\\udc9e\\\\mathcal{C}\\naccording to their relevance to qq.\\n\\n\\nRather than relying on a single similarity metric, Idea2Story adopts a multi-view retrieval\\nformulation that aggregates complementary signals from different semantic abstractions. Formally,\\nfor each research pattern CmC_{m}, we compute a relevance score\\n\\n\\n\\ns\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)=\\u2211v\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb1\\u03bbv\\u200bsv\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q),s(C_{m}\\\\mid q)=\\\\sum_{v\\\\in\\\\mathcal{V}}\\\\lambda_{v}\\\\,s_{v}(C_{m}\\\\mid q),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udcb1={idea,domain,paper}\\\\mathcal{V}=\\\\{\\\\text{idea},\\\\text{domain},\\\\text{paper}\\\\} indexes the retrieval views,\\nsv\\u200b(\\u22c5)s_{v}(\\\\cdot) denotes a view-specific scoring function, and \\u03bbv\\\\lambda_{v} are fixed weighting\\ncoefficients that balance the contribution of different views.\\n\\n\\nIdea-level retrieval.\\n\\nAt the idea level, the system retrieves previously observed research ideas that are semantically\\nsimilar to the input query qq. Let \\u2110\\\\mathcal{I} denote the set of stored research ideas extracted\\nfrom the corpus, and let simidea\\u200b(q,i)\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{idea}}(q,i) denote a semantic similarity function\\nbetween qq and an idea i\\u2208\\u2110i\\\\in\\\\mathcal{I}. The idea-level score of a research pattern CmC_{m} is\\ncomputed by aggregating the similarity scores of ideas associated with the pattern:\\n\\n\\n\\nsidea\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)=maxi\\u2208\\u2110\\u200b(Cm)\\u2061simidea\\u200b(q,i),s_{\\\\text{idea}}(C_{m}\\\\mid q)=\\\\max_{i\\\\in\\\\mathcal{I}(C_{m})}\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{idea}}(q,i),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u2110\\u200b(Cm)\\\\mathcal{I}(C_{m}) denotes the set of ideas linked to pattern CmC_{m}.\\n\\n\\n\\nDomain-level retrieval.\\n\\nAt the domain level, the system interprets the input idea qq in terms of its underlying research\\ndomains and methodological themes. Let \\ud835\\udc9f\\\\mathcal{D} denote the set of research domains, and let\\nsimdomain\\u200b(q,d)\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{domain}}(q,d) measure the relevance between qq and domain d\\u2208\\ud835\\udc9fd\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}.\\nThe domain-level score of pattern CmC_{m} is computed as\\n\\n\\n\\nsdomain\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)=\\u2211d\\u2208\\ud835\\udc9f\\u200b(Cm)simdomain\\u200b(q,d)\\u200bw\\u200b(d,Cm),s_{\\\\text{domain}}(C_{m}\\\\mid q)=\\\\sum_{d\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}(C_{m})}\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{domain}}(q,d)\\\\,w(d,C_{m}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udc9f\\u200b(Cm)\\\\mathcal{D}(C_{m}) denotes the domains associated with pattern CmC_{m}, and w\\u200b(d,Cm)w(d,C_{m}) captures\\nempirical effectiveness signals derived from the knowledge graph.\\n\\n\\n\\nPaper-level retrieval.\\n\\nAt the paper level, the system retrieves papers whose technical content is semantically aligned\\nwith the input idea. Let \\ud835\\udcab\\u200b(Cm)\\\\mathcal{P}(C_{m}) denote the set of papers instantiating pattern CmC_{m}.\\nThe paper-level score is computed as\\n\\n\\n\\nspaper\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)=maxp\\u2208\\ud835\\udcab\\u200b(Cm)\\u2061simpaper\\u200b(q,p)\\u22c5\\u03b1\\u200b(p),s_{\\\\text{paper}}(C_{m}\\\\mid q)=\\\\max_{p\\\\in\\\\mathcal{P}(C_{m})}\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{paper}}(q,p)\\\\cdot\\\\alpha(p),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere simpaper\\u200b(q,p)\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{paper}}(q,p) measures semantic similarity between qq and paper pp,\\nand \\u03b1\\u200b(p)\\\\alpha(p) denotes a quality-related weight derived from peer review metadata.\\n\\n\\nThe final ranked list of research patterns is obtained by ordering patterns according to their\\naggregated multi-view relevance scores. Formally, we define\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9e\\u2217\\u200b(q)=RankCm\\u2208\\ud835\\udc9e\\u2061(\\u2211v\\u2208{idea,domain,paper}\\u03bbv\\u200bsv\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)),\\\\mathcal{C}^{*}(q)=\\\\operatorname{Rank}_{C_{m}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{C}}\\\\left(\\\\sum_{v\\\\in\\\\{\\\\text{idea},\\\\text{domain},\\\\text{paper}\\\\}}\\\\lambda_{v}\\\\,s_{v}(C_{m}\\\\mid q)\\\\right),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere patterns are sorted in descending order of the aggregated score.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2.2 Review-Guided Refinement\\n\\nAfter candidate research patterns are retrieved, Idea2Story refines them using an explicit\\nLLM-based review loop. In each iteration, a large language model is prompted to act as a reviewer\\nand evaluate the current research pattern along several predefined criteria, including technical\\nsoundness, novelty with respect to existing literature, and overall clarity of the problem\\u2013method\\nalignment. The reviewer produces both scalar judgments and concrete revision suggestions.\\n\\n\\nThe system then uses this feedback to update the research pattern in a targeted manner. When the\\nreview indicates insufficient novelty, the system modifies the pattern by recombining compatible\\nmethod units or introducing alternative realizations within the same pattern family. When the\\nreview identifies issues in feasibility or ambiguity in formulation, the system revises the problem\\ndefinition or method structure to improve consistency and executability. Each revised pattern is\\nre-submitted to the same review process, forming an explicit generate\\u2013review\\u2013revise loop.\\n\\n\\nTo prevent uncontrolled drift, only revisions that improve the reviewer scores are retained;\\notherwise, the system rolls back to the previous version. This process repeats until the reviewer\\njudges the pattern to be sufficiently novel, coherent, and technically plausible, or until further\\niterations no longer yield improvement. The output of this stage is a refined research pattern that\\nhas been iteratively vetted by an LLM-based reviewer and is suitable for downstream validation and\\npaper generation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"4 Experiments and Analysis\": \"\\n\\n4 Experiments and Analysis\\n\\nWe evaluate Idea2Story through a set of experiments focusing on its ability to extract reusable\\nmethodological structure and to generate high-quality research patterns from ambiguous user input.\\nOur experiments are conducted on a corpus of accepted papers from ICLR and NeurIPS over the past\\nthree years, including approximately 13K papers and their associated peer reviews, which serves as\\nthe foundation for all subsequent analyses. Based on this corpus, we first analyze the properties of the extracted method units to assess whether Idea2Story captures meaningful and reusable methodological abstractions. We then present qualitative demonstrations of research patterns instantiated as structured research stories, illustrating how the system transforms vague research intent into coherent and methodologically grounded research directions.\\n\\n\\n\\nCase 1: Method Unit Extraction Demo\\n\\n\\nPaper Title:\\nLearning Dynamics of LLM Finetuning\\nBase Problem:\\nUnderstanding how specific training examples influence model predictions during finetuning is challenging, particularly in large language models.\\nSolution Pattern:\\nDevelop a framework to analyze step-wise influence accumulation among potential responses during finetuning, providing insights into phenomena like hallucination and the squeezing effect in off-policy direct preference optimization.\\nStory:\\nReframe the understanding of LLM finetuning through the lens of learning dynamics, offering a unified interpretation of training behaviors and inspiring methods to enhance model alignment and performance.\\nApplication:\\nImproving alignment in large language models, enhancing finetuning strategies for better model performance, diagnosing and mitigating hallucination in AI systems.\\n\\nFigure 3: An example of a method unit extracted from an accepted paper, illustrating the separation of the base problem, solution pattern, and higher-level research story.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.1 Implementation Details\\n\\nTo further assess the effectiveness of Idea2Story in practical research ideation settings, we\\nconduct additional qualitative experiments on a small set of representative cases. Specifically,\\nwe evaluate three user-provided research ideas curated by an external collaborator. For each case,\\nIdea2Story generates research patterns using the GLM-4.7 (zeng2025glm) model as the underlying language backbone. As a baseline, we compare against direct LLM generation, where the same model is prompted to produce a complete research story without explicit pattern modeling or retrieval.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.2 Case Study: Method Unit Extraction\\n\\nWe present a representative case study to illustrate the behavior of the proposed method unit\\nextraction agent. Case 1 shows an example extracted from an accepted paper, where the system decomposes the full paper into a structured set of methodological elements.\\n\\n\\nAs shown in the example, the extracted method unit explicitly separates the underlying research\\nproblem, the core solution pattern, and the resulting research story. The Base Problem describes the core challenge addressed by the paper, namely understanding how individual training examples influence model behavior during finetuning, without depending on specific datasets or implementation details. The Solution Pattern summarizes the central methodological idea as\\nan analysis framework for step-wise influence accumulation, highlighting the key mechanism without\\nbinding it to a particular optimization setup or experimental configuration. Importantly, the extracted Story reframes the technical contribution at a higher level of\\nabstraction, connecting learning dynamics to broader phenomena such as hallucination and alignment\\nin large language models. This abstraction reflects how the method unit goes beyond algorithmic\\ndetails to capture the conceptual contribution of the paper. Finally, the Application\\nfield grounds the method unit by indicating downstream research and system-level implications,\\nwithout enumerating task-specific benchmarks.\\n\\n\\nThis example demonstrates that the extraction agent isolates reusable methodological structure while\\nfiltering out implementation-level details. By representing the paper as a coherent method unit\\nrather than a collection of experimental components, Idea2Story enables subsequent reuse,\\ncomparison, and composition of methodological ideas across papers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3 Knowledge Graph Analysis\\n\\nWe analyze the structure of the constructed knowledge graph to understand how extracted method\\nunits are distributed across papers and research domains. As illustrated in Figure 2, the graph\\nexhibits a clear hub-and-spoke structure, where a small number of high-frequency domains connect\\nto a large number of papers and research patterns. This reflects the uneven distribution of\\nresearch activity across domains, while also highlighting domains that function as central hubs\\nfor methodological reuse. Importantly, many research patterns are observed to connect multiple\\ndomains simultaneously, indicating that the extracted method units often capture methodological\\nabstractions that generalize beyond a single application area. In contrast, paper-level nodes are typically associated with a single domain, whereas pattern-level nodes frequently act as bridges between otherwise weakly connected domains. This structural separation suggests that the knowledge graph encodes two distinct levels of organization\\u2014instance-level\\n\\nFigure 4: Visualization of the knowledge graph substructure induced by high-frequency research\\ndomains.\\n\\n\\nresearch artifacts and reusable methodological abstractions\\u2014enabling Idea2Story to retrieve and compose research patterns at a higher level of abstraction rather than relying on domain-specific or paper-specific similarity alone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAspect\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIdea2Story Generated (IntentDiff)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLLM Direct Generated (EcoIntent)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTitle\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIntentDiff: Reframing E-commerce Intent Classification via Structural Evolution and Context-Aware Diffusion\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEcoIntent: A Context-Aware Multi-Granularity Agent for E-commerce Intent Understanding via Hierarchical Contrastive Learning\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbstract Focus\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReinterprets intent classification as a structural evolution process rather than static text classification. The approach leverages a diffusion-based framework to iteratively refine noisy query representations into precise intent labels, integrates product graph embeddings to ground predictions in e-commerce context, and introduces a discrete, context-aware tokenizer to handle long-tail domain vocabulary.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTargets improved intent classification performance by integrating heterogeneous behavioral context and hierarchical product knowledge. A dual-stream architecture aligns semantic representations with user interaction history, and hierarchical contrastive learning enforces consistency across fine- and coarse-grained intent categories.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProblem Definition\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReframes e-commerce intent classification from static text prediction to dynamic structural reasoning. User queries are short, ambiguous, and heavily dependent on implicit catalog structure, which fixed-label classification fails to capture. Intent understanding is modeled as an evolving process under structural constraints.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFormulates intent understanding as a conventional multi-class classification problem, where the input is a query augmented with session context and the output is an intent label from a predefined set. The main challenge is semantic sparsity caused by short and ambiguous queries.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCore Research Gap\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExisting intent classification methods treat queries in isolation and ignore domain-specific structural priors in e-commerce. They fail to exploit rich relationships between products and attributes, and standard vocabularies struggle with long-tail, domain-specific terminology. No prior work unifies diffusion-based refinement with structural graph embeddings for intent disambiguation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrior work suffers from (1) context isolation, where behavioral signals such as clicks are underutilized, and (2) a flat-label assumption that ignores the hierarchical nature of e-commerce taxonomies, leading to inconsistent predictions for fine-grained, long-tail intents.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMethod Skeleton\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA diffusion-based classifier that iteratively denoises intent representations; a context-aware discrete tokenizer based on a VQ-VAE variant to encode diverse e-commerce queries; and integration of pretrained product graph embeddings as structural priors during the denoising process.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA dual-stream discriminative architecture consisting of a BERT-based text encoder, a lightweight GNN for aggregating behavioral interaction graphs, and a prediction head trained with hierarchical contrastive learning; parameter-efficient adaptation via LoRA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInnovation Claims\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(1) Reformulates intent classification as a diffusion-based dynamic refinement process;\\n(2) Introduces discrete, context-aware intent tokenization to better handle long-tail domain vocabulary;\\n(3) Enhances intent reasoning by incorporating product graph structural embeddings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(1) Contextualized intent modeling via joint reasoning over text and behavioral graphs;\\n(2) Hierarchical contrastive learning leveraging product taxonomies;\\n(3) Parameter-efficient system design achieving strong performance at reduced computational cost.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 1: \\nComparison of research patterns generated by Idea2Story and a direct LLM baseline,\\nboth starting from the same underspecified user input:\\n\\u201cI want to build an e-commerce agent that can better understand user intent.\\u201d\\nThe table contrasts how different generation mechanisms transform the same vague research intent\\ninto concrete research patterns.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.4 Qualitative Comparison of Generated Research Patterns\\n\\nWe further compare the quality of research patterns generated by Idea2Story and a direct LLM\\nbaseline. Both systems start from the same underspecified user input and produce structured\\nresearch proposals, enabling a controlled comparison of how different generation mechanisms\\ntransform vague research intent into concrete research patterns.\\n\\n\\nTable 1 presents a side-by-side comparison of representative outputs along multiple dimensions,\\nincluding problem formulation, methodological structure, and innovation claims. Rather than\\nevaluating surface-level writing quality, the comparison focuses on the resulting research\\npatterns as methodological blueprints\\u2014i.e., how the generated ideas frame the research problem,\\nidentify gaps in prior work, and organize methodological components into a coherent approach. As shown in the table, Idea2Story tends to induce higher-level problem reformulation, transforming\\nintent understanding from a fixed classification task into a dynamic structural reasoning process.\\nThe resulting research pattern emphasizes generative refinement, structural priors, and evolving\\nrepresentations. In contrast, the direct LLM baseline largely operates within a conventional task\\nformulation, proposing a stronger system through the integration of additional components such as\\ncontext modeling and hierarchical objectives.\\n\\n\\nTo reduce evaluation bias, the generated research stories from both approaches are subsequently\\nassessed by an independent large language model (Gemini 3 Pro) (team2025gemma), which is not involved in either generation process. The evaluator is instructed to compare the outputs in terms of novelty, methodological substance, and overall research quality, without access to the generation method\\nused. Across all evaluated cases, the externally evaluated results consistently favor the outputs\\ngenerated by Idea2Story. In particular, the research stories produced by direct LLM generation tend\\nto remain at a high level of abstraction, with less concrete methodological grounding and reliance\\non relatively standard techniques. In contrast, Idea2Story-generated research patterns exhibit\\nclearer problem framing, more specific methodological structures, and stronger signals of novelty.\\n\\n\\n\", \"5 Future Work\": \"\\n\\n5 Future Work\\n\\nWhile Idea2Story focuses on grounding vague research intent into structured and high-quality research patterns, an important direction for future work is to extend this framework toward a fully closed-loop research generation pipeline. A promising extension is the integration of experiment-driven agents that can instantiate, validate, and iteratively refine generated research patterns through empirical feedback, including automated experimental design, dataset selection, and preliminary execution. Experimental outcomes can then serve as additional signals to refine the instantiated research stories, forming a feedback loop between method design and empirical validation. Beyond experimentation, future work may further explore how refined research patterns can be systematically translated into complete paper drafts, covering method descriptions, experimental results, and discussion sections. By grounding paper generation in empirically validated research patterns, such a system could move beyond surface-level text generation and provide more faithful, end-to-end support for executable and publishable scientific discovery.\\n\\n\", \"6 Conclusion\": \"\\n\\n6 Conclusion\\n\\nWe presented Idea2Story, a pre-computation\\u2013driven framework for autonomous scientific discovery that shifts literature understanding from runtime reasoning to offline knowledge structuring. By explicitly extracting reusable method units and organizing them into a continuously updated knowledge graph, Idea2Story enables research agents to reason over stable research patterns rather than repeatedly processing raw papers. Our qualitative analyses and comparative studies show that this design leads to research patterns with clearer problem reformulation, stronger methodological structure, and higher conceptual novelty than direct LLM generation. These results highlight the importance of explicit pattern modeling as a foundation for scalable and reliable autonomous research. Looking ahead, integrating Idea2Story with experimental agents to close the loop from abstract research patterns to validated empirical results represents a promising direction toward fully autonomous and trustworthy scientific discovery.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"}, \"bibliography\": {}, \"domain\": \"cs.CE\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"9e600168-559d-429e-a0c8-ebcd84750e07\", \"authors\": [\"Jiangen He\", \"Wen Lou\"], \"title\": \"How Disciplinary Partnerships Shape Research Landscape in U.S. Library and Information Science Schools\", \"abstract\": \"This study provides the first comprehensive empirical mapping of how organizational structures and research portfolios co-occur across U.S. Library and Information Science (LIS) schools. Analyzing 14,705 publications from 1,264 faculty members across 44 institutions (2013--2024), we employ computational methods including word embeddings and topic modeling to identify 16 distinct research themes organized into three foundational dimensions: Library and Knowledge Organization (LKO), Human-Centered Technology (HCT), and Computing Systems (CS). Our mixed-method analysis reveals significant differences in research composition across organizational types: Computer-affiliated schools cluster tightly in computationally-intensive research and differ significantly from all other school types, while independent Information schools demonstrate the greatest research diversity. Temporal analysis of LIS schools reveals complex evolutionary dynamics: 51.4% are moving toward HCT, 37.8% toward CS, and 37.8% toward LKO, with many schools simultaneously shifting along multiple dimensions. Contrary to narratives of computational dominance, HCT emerged as LIS's primary growth vector. These patterns challenge assumptions about field fragmentation, revealing structured diversification shaped by but not determined by organizational positioning.

Unlike disciplines with clearly delineated theoretical frameworks and methodological canons, LIS draws its intellectual foundations from diverse fields including computer science, cognitive psychology, sociology, communication studies, and education [Larivire2012, Zhu2016]. This theoretical and methodological eclecticism is not incidental but constitutive: LIS scholarship evolves in dialogue with and often in response to developments in adjacent disciplines [Cronin2008, Furner2015].\\n\\n\\nThis interdisciplinary character has profound implications for how LIS units are positioned within universities. As the field has evolved, particularly with the rise of digital technologies and data science, LIS schools have increasingly reorganized themselves, forming partnerships with computer science departments, communication schools, education colleges, or positioning themselves as standalone information schools [Wiggins2012, Wu2012]. These structural choices are consequential, influencing faculty recruitment patterns, resource allocation, curriculum development, and ultimately the research agendas pursued by these institutions [Martzoukou2017].\\n\\n\\nYet this same interdisciplinarity that enriches LIS intellectually also creates ambiguity about institutional positioning. From university administrators\\u2019 perspectives, the question \\u201cWhere does LIS belong?\\u201d has no obvious answer [vakkari2024characterizes]. Should information schools align with computer science to emphasize computational methods? Partner with communication to emphasize the social dimensions of information? Affiliate with education to foreground information literacy? Or maintain independence to preserve disciplinary autonomy? These decisions are rarely made on purely intellectual grounds; institutional politics, resource constraints, and historical contingencies all play roles [Dillon2012, Marchionini2008].\\n\\n\\nThe relationship between organizational structure and research direction is unlikely to be unidirectional. While structure may shape research by influencing collaboration networks, hiring priorities, and resource access [Salancik1978, Whitley2000], research interests also drive structural choices as schools position themselves to align with faculty strengths and emerging opportunities [Mintzberg1979]. Previous scholarship has acknowledged this reciprocal relationship in principle but has provided limited empirical evidence about how it manifests in LIS specifically [Ma2012, Wiggins2012]. The result is a gap in our understanding: we lack systematic documentation of whether and how organizational structures and research profiles co-occur in patterned ways across the LIS field.\\n\\n\\nUnderstanding these patterns carries significance for multiple stakeholders. For academic leaders and strategic planners, empirical evidence about how organizational positioning relates to research profiles can inform decisions about restructuring, mergers, or partnership formations [King2017]. For accreditation bodies and professional organizations, these patterns raise questions about whether unified standards make sense when schools pursue such different research agendas [Juznic2003]. For doctoral students and early-career faculty, knowing how organizational structure relates to research environment helps inform program selection and career planning [Sugimoto2011]. For the field broadly, documenting the relationship between institutional diversity and intellectual diversity addresses ongoing debates about LIS identity, coherence, and future viability [Bawden2008, Cronin2005].\\n\\n\\nThis study addresses this gap by providing the first comprehensive empirical mapping of organizational structures and research landscapes in U.S. Library and Information Science schools. Specifically, we investigate three research questions:\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nRQ1: What is the intellectual structure of LIS research in the U.S., and what foundational dimensions define its landscape?\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nRQ2: How does the organizational structure of LIS schools relate to the composition of their research portfolios?\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\n\\nRQ3: How have the research priorities of LIS schools evolved over the past 12 years (2013\\u20132024), and does organizational type influence these evolutionary trajectories?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis study makes three primary contributions. First, we provide comprehensive documentation of how 44 U.S. LIS schools are organized and what research they produce, covering 14,705 publications between 2013 and 2024 published by 1,264 faculty members. Second, we develop a research landscape mapping that identifies 16 distinct research themes and three foundational research dimensions (Library and Knowledge Organization, Human-Centered Technology, and Computing Systems), providing a shared vocabulary for discussing LIS\\u2019s intellectual diversity. Third, we reveal systematic patterns in how organizational structures and research profiles co-occur, that challenge simplistic narratives about the field\\u2019s transformation. It provides an essential empirical foundation for future work and discussion using mixed-method designs to investigate the mechanisms linking structure and scholarship.\\n\\n\", \"2 Literature Review\": \"\\n\\n2 Literature Review\\n\\n\\n2.1 Evolving Identity of LIS\\n\\nThe intellectual core of Library and Information Science has perpetually been defined by its struggle and synergy with interdisciplinarity [Bates1999]. The field\\u2019s theoretical foundation is not a single, stable paradigm but a dynamic and often contentious conversation between imported frameworks and native concepts.\\n\\n\\nTheoretically, LIS has oscillated between embracing its identity as a \\u201cmeta-discipline\\u201d\\u2014a connector of other fields\\u2014and seeking a unique, unifying theory of its own [Cronin2005]. Early anchors in social epistemology and information behavior have been supplemented, and sometimes challenged, by computational and socio-technical theories borrowed from computer science, social informatics, and science and technology studies [Larivire2012]. This has led to a rich but fragmented theoretical landscape where a study on algorithmic bias in search engines and an ethnographic study of a public library\\u2019s community role can sit under the same disciplinary umbrella, speaking different theoretical languages.\\n\\n\\nMethodologically, this theoretical diversity is mirrored by a dramatic expansion from its qualitative, user-study roots. While surveys, interviews, and historical analysis remain vital, the field has undergone a pronounced \\u201ccomputational turn.\\u201d[lou2021temporally] Bibliometrics, once a niche specialty, is now a mainstream methodology. Network analysis, natural language processing, and data mining are increasingly common, pushing LIS research closer to the data sciences[yang2025quantifying]. This methodological borrowing is a double-edged sword: it increases technical rigor and relevance to the digital age but also risks diluting the field\\u2019s distinctive human-centered methodological heritage.\\n\\n\\nIn terms of application and boundaries, LIS has aggressively expanded from its traditional home in libraries and archives [Sugimoto2011]. Its applications now prominently include health informatics, where it contributes to patient data management and consumer health information [chen2024you]; scholarly communication, where it studies the entire research lifecycle from peer review to open science [van2025scholarly]; and social media analysis, where it investigates misinformation and online communities [diaz2019towards]. This boundary-pushing work is the field\\u2019s greatest source of vitality but also its greatest identity crisis. The core question remains: Is LIS defined by its core object of study (\\u201cinformation\\u201d) or by its unique perspective on that object, and if the latter, what precisely is that perspective?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2.2 Organizational Anatomy of LIS Schools\\n\\nThe intellectual tensions within LIS are physically and administratively manifested in the organizational structures of its academic units[Sugimoto2011]. A significant body of internal LIS research has dissected these structures, revealing how they function as engines that shape the field\\u2019s future [Wu2025].\\n\\n\\nA primary focus has been on faculty and research performance. Studies consistently show that an LIS school\\u2019s organizational partnership is a powerful predictor of its research output. Schools partnered with computer science departments tend to publish more in conference proceedings, secure larger grants, and have higher per-faculty publication counts in computationally intensive areas. In contrast, standalone iSchools often boast greater research diversity but may face challenges in achieving critical mass in any one area[bowman2021similarities, wang2025ischools, shah2021ischool]. Faculty hiring patterns are a key mechanism here; a school merging with a communications department will naturally hire faculty with mass media expertise, thereby steering its research agenda toward social media and public opinion[zuo2019standing].\\n\\n\\nAnother critical area of study is curriculum, education, and student outcomes. The syllabus is a direct reflection of organizational identity. Research analyzing course catalogs finds that LIS programs embedded in computer science colleges require more programming and data science courses, while those in education colleges emphasize pedagogy and instructional design. This curricular differentiation directly impacts student pathways [zhang2022creating, weintrop2022ischools]. Graduates from technically-oriented programs are funneled into tech industry roles like UX research and data analytics, while graduates from more traditional or socially-oriented programs more often enter academic, public, or school libraries. This creates a feedback loop where alumni success in a sector reinforces the school\\u2019s strategic focus on it.[huang2025we]\\n\\n\\nFinally, research on leadership, strategy, and accreditation examines the forces that create these structures in the first place. Deans and directors operate under significant pressure, making strategic choices about partnerships to secure resources, enhance prestige, or ensure survival in a competitive university environment [corieri2024ischool, lou2018research]. Accreditation bodies, like the American Library Association, represent another structural force, attempting to uphold core professional competencies across wildly different organizational models\\u2014a tension that raises fundamental questions about whether a unified set of standards can or should apply to such a diverse ecosystem. [bowman2021similarities]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2.3 Institutional Research in LIS\\n\\nThe LIS field has increasingly turned its analytical tools upon itself, generating a multi-layered body of institutional research that documents its own evolution from global to individual scales.\\n\\n\\nAt the macro (global/country) level, bibliometric studies dominate. These large-scale analyses map the field\\u2019s growth, identifying the most prolific nations, the most cited journals, and the rise and fall of major research themes over decades. They reveal, for instance, the ascendancy of China as a major contributor to LIS research and the global shift from \\\"library\\\" to \\\"information\\\" as a central focus. However, these macro-studies often treat \\\"LIS\\\" as a monolith, aggregating data in ways that can conceal the rich organizational diversity underneath. [zheng2025understanding, Rehman2024, Dora2020]\\n\\n\\nAt the meso (institutional/cross-institutional) level, the research becomes sparser. While case studies of individual iSchools or comparative analyses of a handful of programs exist [shah2021ischool, wang2025ischools, Wu2025, Zhu2016, zuo2019standing], there is a significant gap in comprehensive, systematic studies. We lack a clear field-wide understanding of how different organizational models correlate with differentiated research portfolios, faculty demographics, and funding patterns. This level is crucial because it is at the institutional level that strategic decisions are made and intellectual identities are most visibly formed and sustained.[he2025academic]\\n\\n\\nAt the micro (individual/faculty) level, research focuses on the lived experience of the field\\u2019s practitioners. This includes studies of doctoral students\\u2019 dissertation topics, which serve as a leading indicator of the field\\u2019s future direction. It also includes analyses of faculty publishing habits, collaboration networks, and professional identity, exploring how individual scholars navigate the competing demands of interdisciplinary work and departmental expectations [zhu2024dependency]. This level reveals the human impact of the macro trends and meso-level structures, showing how large-scale shifts in the field play out in the daily work and careers of its members [li2022worldwide, wiles2024teaching].\\n\\n\\nIn all, we have a rich understanding of LIS\\u2019s intellectual diversity and a growing, though less systematic, understanding of its organizational diversity . We also have robust theories from higher education studies suggesting these two should be linked [TorresZapata2019]. However, the crucial bridge\\u2014a comprehensive, empirical mapping of how specific organizational structures co-occur with specific research profiles\\u2014remains largely unbuilt. Our study addresses this by uniting these three strands: it uses the methods of macro-level institutional research to conduct a meso-level analysis of organizational types, in order to explain the intellectual identity and diversification of the field.\\n\\n\\n\", \"3 Methods\": \"\\n\\n3 Methods\\n\\nFour major steps compose the workflow of the study (Figure 1), including collecting data of LIS schools, faculty data in the schools over years, publication data of the faculty members from 2013 to 2024, and data analysis pipeline.\\n\\n\\nFigure 1: A workflow of the study, including the data collection and analysis.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1 School Data Collection\\n\\nWe used the list of Best Library and Information Studies Programs from U.S. News and World Report (ranked in 2021) to select schools for this study, in which there are 55 schools. We examine these 55 schools by visiting their website to code their organizational structure. (Step 1 in Figure 1). There are four types of schools that have been excluded from this study. (1) We excluded schools that offer only an LIS degree program without an academic unit of LIS (three schools). These programs may be emerging ones, but most of them do not have full-time faculty for the LIS program. (2) We exclude schools that do not have a school website (one school) or no faculty information online (two schools). (3) We exclude one school that cannot be identified in web archives (Step 2 in Figure 1). 4) We exclude four schools that do not have faculty publication data in Dimension (Step 3 in Figure 1). Eventually, 44 out of 55 schools were included in the study.\\n\\n\\nWe categorized the schools\\u2019 organizational types. We took into account the history of the school to code their organizational type. For example, the LIS school at the University at Albany\\u2013SUNY is currently aligned with Cybersecurity and Homeland Security, but it had been associated with computer science for many years before they formed the new school. Eventually, we identified five major types of academic structures among LIS schools. Table 1 shows a complete list of schools for the five types.\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nInformation: LIS units are standalone and independent, not sharing academic administration with any other discipline.

The most reliable approach involves identifying faculty members from institutional websites and subsequently gathering their publications by name, which presents a significant methodological challenge. Given that faculty recruitment patterns may reflect shifts in institutional research priorities, we employed the Internet Archive\\u2019s Wayback Machine to capture faculty information at multiple temporal points. We collected faculty data annually to characterize institutional research focus changes over three-year periods. For instance, faculty information from 2014 was used to identify publications from 2013, 2014, and 2015. Consequently, we gathered faculty data from 2014, 2017, 2020, and 2023 to cover publications spanning 2012 to 2024 (see Step 2 in Figure 1). For each institution at each data collection point, we began by searching the current faculty directory URL in the Wayback Machine and extracted faculty information from archived website snapshots. We utilized Python scripts to collect snapshot URLs for faculty data extraction. However, many directory page URLs had changed over time, requiring manual identification of the correct archived faculty directory pages. We employed institutional website URLs in the Wayback Machine to locate faculty directory page snapshots. When institutional websites had undergone structural changes, we navigated back to university-level snapshots to identify the appropriate school-level archives. In rare instances where university website URLs had changed completely, we utilized search engines to identify historical university website URLs. Through this systematic approach, we successfully collected archived snapshots of all LIS school faculty directory pages in 2014, 2017, 2020, and 2023. The snapshot URLs follow the standard Internet Archive format: \\u201chttps://web.archive.org/web/{timestamp}/{directory_page_URL}\\u201d.\\n\\n\\nAll faculty names were collected with the assistance of browser-use\\u2019s AI feature.\\nA standardized prompt was issued for each directory page to extract faculty information (see prompt in the Appendix).\\nWe manually validated all extracted records and consolidated them into a single table.\\nWe examined the data for abnormalities, such as implausible faculty entries in a given year or dramatic year-over-year changes.\\nAlthough some turnover is expected, substantial shifts are uncommon.\\nWhen anomalies were detected, we repeated data collection for that year manually.\\nAfter establishing broad consistency across years, we randomly selected one of the four collection points for detailed manual verification of accuracy.\\nIn total, we compiled 3,379 faculty records across the four collection points (745 in 2014, 823 in 2017, 805 in 2020, 1,006 in 2023), including tenure-track, tenured, and non-tenure-track full-time faculty, while excluding adjunct professors, visiting professors, and graduate students.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3 Publication Data Collection\\n\\nNext, we collected the publications of all faculty members (Step 3 in Figure 1).\\nWe used the Dimensions Analytics API (DSL v2) because it provides broad coverage of journals and conferences and supports author disambiguation.\\nBy merging faculty records across years by name and organization, we obtained 1,683 unique faculty records.\\nFor each faculty member, we first issued an exact-name query constrained by institutional affiliation: search researchers where first_name = \\\"{firstname}\\\" and last_name = \\\"{lastname}\\\" and research_orgs.id = \\\"{grid_id}\\\" return researchers, where {grid_id} is the GRID identifier of the faculty member\\u2019s university.\\nIf the exact query returned no result, we relaxed the first-name constraint to a fuzzy match using first_name \\u223c\\\\sim \\\"{firstname}\\\" while keeping the affiliation filter.\\nWhen multiple researcher records were returned for a faculty member, we retrieved recent publications for each candidate and manually identified those working in Library and Information Science or closely related areas.\\nUsing this procedure, 1,264 of 1,683 faculty were matched by name and organization.\\nOf these, 31 were manually disambiguated across multiple returned profiles.\\n\\n\\nWith the researcher IDs, we collected 23,001 publications for the 1,264 faculty members.\\nAmong these, 19,726 were unique publications.\\nWe queried publications using search publications where researchers = \\\"{dimension_id}\\\" return publications.\\nWe retained only records with Document Type in \\u2019RESEARCH_ARTICLE\\u2019, \\u2019CONFERENCE_PAPER\\u2019, \\u2019RESEARCH_CHAPTER\\u2019, \\u2019REVIEW_ARTICLE\\u2019, yielding 16,761 articles.\\nWe detected duplicate entries across preprint and published versions and removed them.\\nThe final deduplicated set contained 14,740 unique publications.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4 Research Theme Modeling and Visualization\\n\\nTo identify and analyze research themes in the field of Library and Information Science (LIS), we employed a state-of-the-art topic modeling approach that leverages transformer-based language models. Specifically, we used BERTopic [grootendorst2022bertopic], which combines the power of BERT-based text embeddings with clustering techniques to discover coherent and interpretable research themes from academic publications. Although BERTopic labels its clusters \\u201ctopics\\u201d, we refer to them as \\u201cresearch themes\\u201d because their granularity is closer to that of domain-level areas in LIS.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4.1 Embedding Generation\\n\\nWe extracted semantic representations from the titles and abstracts of all 14,705 publications using the SPECTER2 model [singh2023scirepeval], which is specifically designed for scholarly document representation. This model captures semantic relationships between academic papers more effectively than general-purpose language models. For each paper, we concatenated the title and abstract text with the SPECTER2 separation token and generated a 768-dimensional embedding vector that encodes the semantic content of the paper.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4.2 Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering\\n\\nThe high-dimensional embeddings were then processed through a multi-step pipeline for identifying research themes:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nDimensionality Reduction: We applied UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) to reduce the embeddings to 10 dimensions while preserving the semantic relationships between papers. This step facilitates more efficient clustering and visualization.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nHierarchical Clustering: We utilized Agglomerative Clustering to group the publications into 16 coherent research themes. This approach was selected after experimentation with HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), as it provided more balanced and interpretable theme clusters for our dataset. We experimented with different number of themes from 10 to 20. We use two basic rules to huristically determine the number of themes. First, the number of themes should be enough to cover all the major research themes without merging major themes into one theme, for example, \\\"Library Science\\\" and \\\"Metadata and Archives\\\" are two major related themes, but they should not be merged into one theme. Second, the themes should not be too similar to each other that can be merged into one theme. We found 16 themes is a good balance between these two rules.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\n\\nTheme Representation: To generate interpretable representations of each theme, we employed a Class-based TF-IDF (c-TF-IDF) transformation combined with Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) to extract distinctive keywords while ensuring diversity in the theme representations.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.\\n\\nTheme Labeling and Refinement\\nThe initial model identified 16 themes. After examining the themes, two small non-LIS topics were identified: \\u201cQuantum Communication\\u201d and \\u201cAtmospheric Chemistry\\u201d.\\nAlthough these topics included publications by LIS-affiliated faculty, they were not central to LIS research and involved only a few authors from LIS schools. We excluded 35 publications from these topics.\\nThe final dataset contained 14,705 publications. The final model contained 14 distinct research themes. For improved interpretability, we enhanced the theme labels using a GPT-4o based system. For each theme, we provided the model with a sample of 500 publication titles and requested concise, descriptive labels along with subtopics and a brief summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4.3 Visualization\\n\\nWe created several visualizations to facilitate the exploration and understanding of the LIS research landscape:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nResearch Landscape Map: Using UMAP, we reduced the embeddings to 2 dimensions for visualization purposes. Each point in the resulting map (Figure 2) represents a publication, colored according to its assigned theme. The size of each point corresponds to its citation count. The landscape map provides an intuitive overview of the proximity and boundaries between different research areas in LIS.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nTheme Distribution by School Type: To analyze the relationship between organizational structure and research focus, we created visualizations showing the distribution of research themes across different types of LIS schools (Figure 4).\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\n\\nUniversity Positioning: We mapped individual universities in the research landscape based on the aggregated embeddings of their faculty publications (Figure 5) by using principal component analysis (PCA), revealing institutional specializations and positioning within the broader LIS research ecosystem.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.\\n\\nTrend Analysis: To visualize the evolution of institutional research profiles, we aggregated the 16 research themes into three foundational dimensions (see Section 4.2). For each university, we calculated the annual proportion of publications in each dimension from 2013 to 2024. We restricted this analysis to 37 schools that met the criteria of having at least 50 publications and data spanning at least 5 years. To identify robust long-term trends amidst year-to-year volatility, we applied linear regression to these annual proportions for each dimension. We then used the regression models to predict the composition of research for the start year (2013) and end year (2024). These predicted start and end points were mapped onto a ternary coordinate system, with arrows connecting the 2013 position to the 2024 position to visualize the magnitude and direction of the shift. This approach allows for a clear depiction of how schools are repositioning themselves within the triangular conceptual space defined by the field\\u2019s three pillars. To categorize these evolutionary trajectories, we analyzed the change in the proportional share of each dimension (LKO, HCT, CS) between the predicted 2013 and 2024 coordinates. We defined a significance threshold of 5 percentage points based on a heuristic evaluation. This threshold provides a robust margin to distinguish meaningful strategic shifts from noise or minor fluctuations. Additionally, sensitivity testing indicated that this cutoff effectively captures the primary evolutionary trends, yielding a reasonable number of significant moves across the dataset without over-interpreting marginal changes. For each dimension, a university was classified as moving \\u201cToward\\u201d that dimension if its share increased by \\u22655%\\\\geq 5\\\\%, and \\u201cAway from\\u201d it if its share decreased by \\u22655%\\\\geq 5\\\\%.

To address this, we applied the Centered Log-Ratio (CLR) transformation to the topic proportions.\\nAitchison distance (Euclidean distance on CLR-transformed data) was then calculated between all pairs of universities to form a distance matrix.\\nWe performed a global PERMANOVA test to assess whether significant overall differences existed among the groups.\\nFollowing a significant global result, we conducted pairwise PERMANOVA comparisons between all school type pairs.\\nWe employed Fisher\\u2019s Protected Least Significant Difference (LSD) procedure for pairwise comparisons to balance Type I and Type II error rates.\\n\\n\\n\", \"4 Results\": \"\\n\\n4 Results\\n\\n\\n4.1 Faculty and Publication Data\\n\\nAs shown in Table 2, faculty size varies substantially by organizational type.\\nComputer units have the largest faculties on average (mean 39.2; median 36.0).\\nInformation units are next (mean 28.2; median 22.0), followed by Communication (mean 18.3; median 20.0) and Education (mean 12.6; median 11.0).\\nArt&Science units are the smallest (mean 10.6; median 9.0).\\n\\n\\nPublication output also differs greatly across school types.\\nComputer exhibits the highest per-faculty productivity (mean 25.9; median 16.0; std 28.3).\\nInformation has the greatest total output (sum 8,837) with moderate per-faculty rates (mean 15.7; median 8.0; std 18.0).\\nCommunication shows mid-range rates (mean 14.2; median 9.0; std 15.8).\\nArt&Science and Education display lower per-faculty publication rates (means 10.6 and 10.9, respectively).\\n\\n\\nTable 2: Publications and Faculty Statistics by Academic Structure Type\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPublications (per faculty)\\nFaculty (per unit)\\n\\n\\nType\\nSum\\nMean\\nMedian\\nStd\\nSum\\nMean\\nMedian\\nStd\\n\\n\\nArt&Science\\n564\\n10.6\\n6.0\\n10.2\\n53\\n10.6\\n9.0\\n3.7\\n\\n\\nCommunication\\n1820\\n14.2\\n9.0\\n15.8\\n128\\n18.3\\n20.0\\n5.9\\n\\n\\nComputer\\n5068\\n25.9\\n16.0\\n28.3\\n196\\n39.2\\n36.0\\n19.2\\n\\n\\nEducation\\n957\\n10.9\\n6.0\\n11.8\\n88\\n12.6\\n11.0\\n6.9\\n\\n\\nInformation\\n8837\\n15.7\\n8.0\\n18.0\\n563\\n28.2\\n22.0\\n19.2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.2 Research Themes\\n\\nTo address RQ1 regarding the intellectual structure and foundational dimensions of the field, we first analyze the research themes emerging from publications. Our theme modeling analysis of 14,705 LIS faculty publications between 2013 and 2024 reveals the interdisciplinary nature of Library and Information Science research in the United States. The model identified 16 distinct research themes as shown in Table 3 and Figure 2. The table shows the label, count, and representation of each theme. The labels were generated by the GPT-4o using the publication title in each theme and adjusted by the authors. The representation is a list of keywords that are most representative of the theme detected by the c-TF-IDF algorithm. The subtopics of each research theme were identified by the GPT-4.1 based system. The count is the number of publications in the theme. The research landscape map (Figure 2) shows the distribution of publications in the 16 themes encoded by different colors. The landscape map provides an intuitive overview of the proximity and boundaries between different research themes in LIS.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: Research landscape of Library and Information Science in the United States from 2013 to 2024. Each point is a publication positioned by semantic similarity. Colors denote the 16 research themes; dense regions and larger labels mark higher volume. Neighboring clusters indicate intellectual proximity.\\n\\n\\nDrawing on the landscape visualization, topic modeling results, representative publications, and the field\\u2019s inherent interdisciplinarity, we identify three research dimensions that constitute the main pillars of LIS.\\nThese dimensions offer a higher-granularity framework for characterizing research interests and research portfolios across the field.\\nWe organize the dimensions and their constituent themes as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nLibrary and Knowledge Organization: Library Science, Metadata and Archives, Scholarly Communication\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nHuman-Centered Technology: Health Informatics and Technology, Social Media, Human-Computer Interaction, Digital Privacy and Well-Being, Computing Education, Health Information Behavior, Information Access and Equity, Extended Reality\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nComputing Systems: Biomedical Informatics, AI and Data Science, Cybersecurity, Information Retrieval, Autonomous Systems\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn Figure 2, traditional LIS sits at the top center with \\u201cLibrary Science\\u201d adjacent to \\u201cMetadata and Archives\\u201d and \\u201cScholarly Communication,\\u201d forming a coherent Library and Knowledge Organization dimension.

Computing Systems dimension, occupying the lower-right and technical fronts, includes \\u201cCybersecurity,\\u201d \\u201cAutonomous Systems,\\u201d \\u201cInformation Retrieval,\\u201d \\u201cBiomedical Informatics,\\u201d and \\u201cAI and Data Science.\\u201d\\n\\n\\nLibrary and Information Science is upheld by the three foundational research groups:\\nLibrary and Knowledge Organization is the discipline\\u2019s heritage and focuses on ensuring knowledge is systematically described, curated, and made discoverable;\\nHuman-Centered Technology keeps the field rooted in people\\u2019s information needs and societal impact, guiding the ethical and inclusive design and use of technologies; and\\nComputing Systems pushes the frontier by developing the algorithms, data infrastructures, and intelligent systems that enable large-scale information access and analysis.\\nTogether these dimensions balance information, human values, and technical innovation, defining the holistic scope of LIS [Saracevic1999, Bates1999, olson2009timelines, Dillon2012, bawden2022introduction].\\n\\n\\nTable 3: The 16 Research Themes Identified in LIS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLabel\\n\\n\\nCount\\n\\n\\nRepresentation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubtopics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\nLibrary Science\\n\\n\\n1593\\n\\n\\nlibrary, librarians, services, literacy, collections, community, education, outreach, policy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLibraries, Librarianship, Information services, and Education\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\nBiomedical Informatics\\n\\n\\n1275\\n\\n\\nbiomedical, ontology, protein, genes, diseases, clinical, semantic, drugs, trials\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBiomedical text mining, Ontologies, Clinical informatics, and Drug discovery\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\nAI and Data Science\\n\\n\\n1255\\n\\n\\nai, machine learning, data, visualization, graphs, modeling, networks, prediction, analytics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMachine learning, Data visualization, Network science, and Predictive analytics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\nMetadata and Archives\\n\\n\\n1231\\n\\n\\nmetadata, archival, curation, preservation, provenance, collections, standards, repositories, reuse\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDigital libraries, Curation, Preservation, and Metadata standards\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\nHealth Informatics and Technology\\n\\n\\n1100\\n\\n\\nhealth, clinicians, caregivers, telehealth, mhealth, devices, interventions, aging, patients\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTelehealth, mHealth, Aging and caregiving, and Health IT design\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\nSocial Media\\n\\n\\n1029\\n\\n\\nsocial media, misinformation, platforms, tweets, facebook, covid, public, news, communities\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSocial media, Misinformation, Online communities, and Credibility\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\nHuman-Computer Interaction\\n\\n\\n987\\n\\n\\nhci, design, usability, participation, accessibility, users, experiences, games, inclusion\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHuman-centered design, Accessibility, Inclusive design, and User experience\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\nDigital Privacy and Well-Being\\n\\n\\n903\\n\\n\\nprivacy, online safety, harassment, well-being, youth, consent, surveillance, policy, ethics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrivacy, Online safety, Digital well-being, and Policy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\nComputing Education\\n\\n\\n818\\n\\n\\nstudents, programming, curriculum, learning, assessment, cs education, analytics, diversity, pedagogy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCS education, Data science curriculum, Diversity, and Learning analytics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\nCybersecurity\\n\\n\\n806\\n\\n\\ncybersecurity, threats, cloud, iot, attacks, detection, blockchain, edge, resilience\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCybersecurity, IoT security, Cloud security, and Threat detection\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\nInformation Retrieval\\n\\n\\n790\\n\\n\\nretrieval, search, queries, relevance, recommendation, ranking, evaluation, user behavior, web\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSearch systems, Recommender systems, Evaluation, and User engagement\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\nHealth Information Behavior\\n\\n\\n657\\n\\n\\nhealth, information seeking, patients, vaccines, misinformation, behaviors, communities, support, public\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHealth information seeking, Vaccination, Public health communication, and Misinformation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\nInformation Access and Equity\\n\\n\\n651\\n\\n\\naccess, equity, digital divide, inclusion, libraries, underserved, community, justice, policy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInformation equity, Access policy, Digital inclusion, and Community engagement\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\nScholarly Communication\\n\\n\\n604\\n\\n\\ncitations, journals, publications, impact, open access, authorship, disciplines, science, metrics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScientometrics, Research evaluation, Collaboration, and Open science\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\nExtended Reality\\n\\n\\n514\\n\\n\\nvr, ar, xr, accessibility, blind, interaction, haptics, children, learning\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXR/VR/AR, Assistive technology, Interaction techniques, and Inclusive design\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\nAutonomous Systems\\n\\n\\n454\\n\\n\\nrobots, trust, autonomy, human-robot interaction, vehicles, agents, transparency, teamwork, safety\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHuman-robot interaction, Trust, Autonomous vehicles, and Agent-based systems\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 3: Publication trends across LIS research themes from 2014 to 2023.

The figures in the first row show the publication trends of LIS in total and the three overarching LIS research dimensions. Total publication output increased steadily over this period with a normalized annual growth rate of n=4.8%n{=}4.8\\\\%, rising from approximately 937 publications in 2013 to around 1,500 in 2024. Human-centered Technology is the fastest-growing research group (n=6.7%n{=}6.7\\\\%), followed by Computing Systems (n=4.5%n{=}4.5\\\\%) and Library and Knowledge Organization (n=1.5%n{=}1.5\\\\%).\\nThe fastest-growing research areas demonstrate expansion: Extended Reality leads with n=13.1%n{=}13.1\\\\% growth, followed by Digital Privacy and Well-Being (n=9.9%n{=}9.9\\\\%), Health Information Behavior (n=9.6%n{=}9.6\\\\%), AI and Data Science (n=9.4%n{=}9.4\\\\%), and Computing Education (n=8.7%n{=}8.7\\\\%).\\nThese emerging areas show clear upward trajectories.\\nStrong but more moderate growth characterizes Social Media (n=7.7%n{=}7.7\\\\%), Autonomous Systems (n=6.8%n{=}6.8\\\\%), while Health Informatics and Technology (n=4.9%n{=}4.9\\\\%), Biomedical Informatics (n=4.6%n{=}4.6\\\\%) continue steady expansion.

This visualization reveals how organizational positioning influences research focus, with clear specialization patterns emerging across different school types.\\n\\n\\nEducation schools demonstrate the strongest commitment to traditional library-oriented research, with Library Science constituting 30.8% of their publications.\\nMetadata and Archives represent another substantial focus area at 19.8%, reinforcing their dedication to information organization and preservation.\\nThese schools also devote considerable attention to Computing Education (8.6%), indicating the education-oriented research focus of the Education schools.\\n\\n\\nComputer schools present the most technically oriented research profile among all organizational types.\\nTheir focus on Biomedical Informatics (15.9%) and Privacy and Security (10.1%) significantly exceeds the LIS-wide averages, reflecting deep engagement with computational methods and data-intensive research domains.\\nNotably, Library Science accounts for merely 2.7% of their research output, representing the lowest proportion among all structural types and a fundamental shift toward technology-driven research.\\n\\n\\nCommunication schools maintain a more balanced research agenda that bridges traditional and emerging information concerns.\\nLibrary Science remains prominent at 26.8%, while Metadata and Archives (8.3%), Social Media research (8.0%), and Information Access and Equity (7.5%) constitute additional focal areas.\\nThis distribution suggests a research orientation that encompasses both institutional information practices and social dimensions of information phenomena.\\n\\n\\nArt&Science schools display similar research emphases as Communication schools. They demonstrate engagement with both traditional information science concerns and data-intensive research domains.\\nLibrary Science comprises 23.8% of their work, while Information Retrieval (13.1%) and Health Information Behavior (12.1%) feature prominently.\\n\\n\\nIndependent Information schools exhibit the most diversified research portfolio, with no single theme dominating their scholarly output.\\nTheir research spans multiple domains relatively evenly, though AI and Data Science (10.6%) emerges as areas of particular concentration.\\nThis balanced distribution suggests that Information schools cultivate broad interdisciplinary connections. Worth noting is that since the majority of the schools are Information schools, it is not surprising they present more diverse research profiles.\\n\\n\\nThe visual comparison across organizational types in Figure 4 reveals how structural positioning fundamentally shapes research agendas.\\nComputer schools clearly drive technical specializations, Education schools sustain traditional library science while incorporating education technologies, and Communication and Art&Science schools foster research on information behavior and social media.\\n\\n\\nTo statistically validate these observed differences, we performed a PERMANOVA using Aitchison distance. The global test revealed a statistically significant difference in research topic composition across the five school types (pseudo-F=1.77F=1.77, p=0.002p=0.002). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons using Fisher\\u2019s Protected LSD indicated that Computer Science-affiliated schools differ significantly from Education (p=0.001p=0.001), Information (p=0.003p=0.003), Communication (p=0.008p=0.008), and Art & Science (p=0.037p=0.037) schools. Additionally, Information schools significantly differ from Education schools (p=0.036p=0.036). Other pairwise comparisons were not statistically significant (p>0.05p>0.05). These results confirm that the \\u201cComputer\\u201d affiliation marks a distinct departure in research identity, while subtle differences also exist between other types of schools.\\n\\n\\nThese patterns observed from the visualization along with the statistical evidence demonstrate that organizational structure serves not merely as an administrative arrangement but as a powerful force shaping the intellectual direction of LIS scholarship.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3.2 Individual School Positioning\\n\\nSince schools of the same type may exhibit substantial variation, we further examine each university\\u2019s research positioning by analyzing the similarity between its publications and those of other institutions.\\nThe university positioning visualization (Figure 5) illustrates how individual institutions situate themselves within the broader research landscape through principal component analysis (PCA).\\nWe employ PCA because its linear nature enables meaningful comparisons of proximity across institutions.\\nThe visualization reveals several notable patterns in the research landscape.\\n\\n\\nFigure 5: Positioning of LIS schools in the research landscape. Each node represents a university, with node color indicating academic structure type. Proximity between institutions reflects similarity in research profiles, revealing clusters of schools with shared research emphases.\\n\\n\\nFirst, Computer schools (shown in green) form a distinct cluster on the right side of the plot, indicating their shared emphasis on computational and technical research areas.\\nSecond, Information schools (shown in blue) form the largest and most dispersed cluster, which reflects their diverse research portfolios spanning both traditional and emerging information science topics.\\nThird, schools from different organizational types cluster together too, suggesting that research focus can transcend structural boundaries. For instance, several Education schools position near Communication schools.\\nFourth, considerable within-type variation exists, demonstrating that organizational structure alone does not determine research direction. For example, University of California\\u2013Los Angeles and Long Island University Post are both Education schools but they are located in different parts of the plot. These patterns reveal that while organizational structure influences research priorities, other factors such as individual institutional cultures, faculty expertise, and strategic choices may also play important roles in shaping research identities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.4 Temporal Evolution and Bidirectional Movement\\n\\nFinally, to answer RQ3 about the evolution of research priorities and the influence of organizational type, we trace the trajectories of schools and school types over the 12-year period.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.4.1 Directional Shifts\\n\\nFigure 6 presents the aggregate temporal evolution (linear regression with 95% confidence interval) of research priorities across the five organizational types of LIS schools. Each arrow represents a school type\\u2019s collective trajectory within the research landscape defined by the three foundational dimensions. Computer schools exhibit a clear shift toward HCT and away from CS research, with slight movement away from LKO and relatively low uncertainty in their trajectories. Information schools also moved toward HCT and CS while retreating from LKO. Communication and Art&Science schools follow similar trajectories to Information schools, though Art&Science schools demonstrate stronger movement toward CS. Education schools display a unique evolutionary pattern, moving toward LKO and CS while shifting away from HCT. While these aggregate patterns reveal meaningful differences across organizational types, substantial heterogeneity exists within each category. Thus, we also examined individual school trajectories.\\n\\n\\nFigure 6: Temporal evolution of research priorities for five types of LIS schools from 2013 to 2024 using ternary plots. Each arrow represents an institution\\u2019s trajectory within the research landscape defined by three foundational dimensions. The band shows 95% confidence interval. The three vertices of each triangle represent 100% concentration in HCT, LKO, and CS, respectively.\\n\\n\\nSimilarly, Figure 7 visualizes the temporal evolution of research priorities for 37 LIS schools from 2013 to 2024 using ternary plots. Each arrow represents a school\\u2019s trajectory within the research landscape defined by three foundational dimensions. The percentage changes in research dimension shares of the schools can be found in Appendix.\\n\\n\\nFigure 7: Ternary plots depicting the directional shifts of LIS schools across three research dimensions from 2013 to 2024. Each of the six panels represents schools exhibiting a specific movement pattern. Each school is represented by an arrow connecting its starting position to its ending position, with colors indicating organizational structure type.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe most profound shift is a migration away from LKO. Panel a2 (Moving Away from LKO) captures the largest grouping, comprising 21 schools (56.8% of the sample) that reduced their relative focus on LKO. This migration spans all organizational types, with arrows originating near the LKO vertex and extending toward the HCT-CS axis, confirming the narrative of a fundamental transition in LIS research. However, the data challenges the assumption of a unidirectional drift. Panel a1 (Moving Toward LKO) reveals a counter-trend, where 14 schools increased their relative focus on LKO. Many of these institutions, already heavily invested in HCT and CS, appear to be re-balancing their portfolios by renewing their engagement with traditional library and information science foundations.\\nPanel b1 (Moving Toward HCT) highlights another primary trend: 19 schools shifting their portfolios toward Human-Centered Technology. This group largely overlaps with those moving away from LKO (Panel a2). Notably, many arrows in this panel are long and terminate near the HCT vertex, suggesting a radical transformation toward HCT rather than a subtle adjustment.\\n\\n\\nPanel c1 (Moving Toward CS) shows a smaller but significant cluster of 14 schools deepening their engagement with CS. Conversely, Panel c2 (Moving Away from CS) shows 11 schools retreating from CS research. These counter-movements are particularly visible among Computer-affiliated schools and schools with heavy investments in CS, which were among the most CS-focused in 2013. This suggests that even computationally intensive schools are seeking more balanced research portfolios.\\n\\n\\nIn summary, the evolution of LIS research is characterized not by a uniform technological drift, but by a complex dynamic of diversification and strategic re-balancing between human-centered, computational, and traditional information priorities. However, it is unclear the strategy of schools moving away and toward different dimensions. Thus, we analyze the pattern combinations of directional shifts to better understand the strategies in the next section.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.4.2 Pattern Combinations\\n\\nAnalysis of how directional movements combine reveals that LIS schools are following diverse evolutionary strategies (Figure 8). The most common pattern is moving Away from LKO. The pattern combined with Toward HCT (16 schools, 43.2%) and Toward CS (10 schools, 27.0%) form the most common evolutionary strategies in LIS. Within this broad trend of distancing from traditional foundations (LKO), a subgroup of 5 schools (13.5%) pursues a \\u201cDual-Diversification\\u201d strategy, simultaneously moving Away from LKO while expanding into both HCT and CS.\\n\\n\\nFigure 8: UpSet plot showing the distribution of schools across different research trend patterns within the three research dimensions.\\nThe horizontal bar chart (left) displays the size of each trend category, while the vertical bar chart (top) shows the composition of intersections by school types.\\nThe dot matrix (bottom right) indicates which trend patterns are combined in each intersection, with connected dots representing combinations.\\nTrend categories include movements toward or away from LKO, HCT, and CS.\\n\\n\\nIn contrast, two other primary evolutionary strategies involve a renewed emphasis on LKO: Away from CS + Toward LKO and Away from HCT + Toward LKO (both 8 schools, 21.6%). These patterns represent distinct pathways for schools re-engaging with LKO. Other salient strategies include Away from HCT + Toward CS (6 schools, 16.2%) and Away from CS + Toward HCT (5 schools, 13.5%). These disparate trajectories underscore that LIS schools are not undergoing a uniform transformation, but rather differentiating into specialized profiles through targeted strategic shifts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"5 Discussion\": \"\\n\\n5 Discussion\\n\\nThe Diversification of LIS and the Question of Disciplinary Coherence\\n\\nOur finding that LIS schools pursue concentrated yet divergent evolutionary strategies speaks directly to longstanding debates about disciplinary coherence and fragmentation [Bawden2008, Cronin2005]. Previous scholarship has expressed concern that LIS risks developing into disconnected subfields as schools pursue computational, social, or traditional library-focused research without shared intellectual foundations [Furner2015]. Our evidence suggests a more nuanced reality: while schools do specialize along distinct dimensions, they do so through systematic patterns rather than chaotic fragmentation. The bifurcation between Human-Centered Technology and Computing Systems pathways among schools leaving traditional LIS may reflect what [whitley2000intellectual] described as the \\u201corganizational fragmentation\\u201d typical of fields with high task uncertainty and low mutual dependence [vakkari2024characterizes, astrom2008formalizing]\\u2014multiple viable approaches exist to studying information phenomena, and schools choose based on resource dependencies and institutional contexts rather than a single disciplinary logic.\\n\\n\\nHowever, the persistence of Library and Knowledge Organization research across all organizational types, combined with the substantial \\u201creturn to foundations\\u201d pattern, challenges declinate narratives. This pattern aligns with [lou2021temporally] observation that information organization remains conceptually central even as methods evolve. The question is not whether LIS will survive computational transformation, but rather how effectively the field integrates new capabilities while preserving distinctive expertise that other disciplines cannot easily replicate.\\n\\n\\n\\nOrganizational Embeddedness and Research Autonomy\\n\\nThe asymmetric clustering patterns we observed\\u2014particularly the tight convergence of Computer schools versus the dispersion of independent Information schools\\u2014can be understood through resource dependence theory [Salancik1978]. Schools partnering with powerful disciplines like computer science gain access to infrastructure, funding networks, and legitimacy, but these benefits come with constraints on research autonomy. Our finding that Computer schools cluster tightly in computationally-intensive research space suggests that resource dependencies shape not just what research is feasible, but what research becomes normative within those institutional contexts.\\n\\n\\nYet resource dependence alone cannot explain our temporal findings. The observation that over half of Computer schools moved away from pure Computing Systems research (while maintaining computational orientation in other dimensions) suggests schools exercise agency in navigating structural constraints. This aligns with recent organizational scholarship emphasizing that embedded actors can strategically decouple from institutional pressures [glaser2018changing]. Computer schools may satisfy Computer Science partnership expectations through faculty hiring and infrastructure sharing while carving out distinctive research niches in computational social science or health informatics that differentiate them from generic Computer Science departments.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Human-Centered Technology Ascendancy\\n\\nPerhaps our most striking finding is that Human-Centered Technology, not Computing Systems, emerged as LIS\\u2019s dominant growth vector. This pattern contradicts conventional wisdom equating \\u201cdata science\\u201d with computational methods broadly, and challenges assumptions that LIS schools must compete with Computer Science departments on systems research to remain relevant. We propose three complementary explanations for HCT\\u2019s prominence. First, path dependence: LIS\\u2019s historical emphasis on user-centered librarianship and information behavior research provides intellectual and methodological foundations that translate more readily into human-computer interaction, social computing, and digital privacy research than into algorithms or systems architecture. Schools building on existing strengths may achieve higher quality output than those attempting to compete in areas where they lack comparative advantage. Second, labor market differentiation: As Computer Science departments flood markets with systems-oriented graduates, LIS programs may find better placement outcomes by preparing graduates who combine technical competence with deep understanding of human information needs\\u2014a skill combination Computer Science programs rarely emphasize. Student demand follows employment opportunities, creating feedback loops that reinforce HCT investment. Third, funding landscape evolution: Major funding agencies increasingly prioritize \\u201csocially-relevant computing\\u201d and \\u201chuman-AI interaction\\u201d over pure systems research (NSF\\u2019s focus on \\u201cAI for Social Good\\u201d, NIH\\u2019s emphasis on human-centered health IT) [tomavsev2020ai, NIH2025]. LIS schools may be responding rationally to these incentive structures.\\n\\n\\n\\nImplications for LIS Education and Accreditation\\n\\nOur findings raise challenges for accreditation bodies and professional organizations assuming uniform standards across organizationally diverse schools. If Computer schools produce 25.9 publications per faculty member focused heavily on computational methods while Education schools produce 10.9 publications per faculty emphasizing information literacy and pedagogy, can a single set of accreditation standards meaningfully assess both? Current ALA accreditation focuses on professional competencies rather than research profiles, but faculty expertise necessarily shapes what students learn.[salaba202321st]\\nThe field faces a choice: embrace organizational diversity by developing multiple accreditation pathways recognizing different institutional missions, or insist on core competencies that all graduates must demonstrate regardless of school type. The former risks fragmentation and loss of professional identity; the latter may impose unrealistic expectations on schools with limited resources.\\n\\n\\n\\nLimitations and Future Directions\\n\\nOur descriptive analysis documents co-occurrence patterns but cannot establish whether organizational structure shapes research, research drives structural choices, or both co-evolve. Our U.S.-focused sample may not generalize internationally, and publication-based measures exclude teaching, service, and professional impact. Future research should examine mechanisms linking structure to research: Do Computer Science partnerships influence outcomes through hiring, infrastructure, or disciplinary norms? Do different structures produce graduates with distinct competencies and career outcomes?

These mobile robotic systems are increasingly utilized in diverse domains such as agriculture, logistics, surveillance, environmental monitoring, and search and rescue operations. As these robots operate in complex, dynamic, and often unpredictable environments, there is a growing need to enhance their autonomy to perform tasks with higher accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability.\\n\\n\\nOne of the critical factors in achieving greater autonomy in mobile robotic systems is the effective use of knowledge. Mobile robots require comprehensive and precise knowledge about their environment, tasks, actions, and inherent capabilities to make informed decisions and execute tasks successfully across different contexts. Traditionally, this knowledge has been encoded in algorithms and static databases, which often lack the flexibility and scalability needed to handle the dynamic nature of real-world scenarios.\\n\\n\\nTo address these limitations, the concept of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) has emerged as a powerful tool for knowledge representation and reasoning. KGs provide a structured and semantically rich framework for organizing information, enabling both the representation of complex relationships and efficient algorithms for knowledge retrieval and reasoning. Integrating KGs into mobile robot systems can enhance their capability to perform these tasks autonomously by providing real-time situational awareness, contextual understanding, and decision support.\\n\\n\\nDespite these advantages, the development and implementation of KGs in mobile robotic systems present several challenges, including data integration from various sensors and sources, real-time knowledge updating, or multi-agent interaction.\\n\\n\\nThis paper aims to develop a comprehensive methodology for applying KG to existing ROS 2 based robotic systems using a \\u201dbrownfield\\u201d approach. Our goal is to enhance the explainability of the robot\\u2019s operations during various stages and to leverage this knowledge for informed decision-making processes.\\n\\n\\nTo this end, we provide the following contributions:\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nA detailed description of each step of the methodology, specifying the required inputs and the process to achieve the desired outputs to ensure clarity and precision in executing each phase effectively.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nSoftware tools to apply the described methodology to any ROS 2 based robotic system.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nA working example describing the application of the proposed methodology to Aerostack2 [2], a ROS 2 open-source framework to design and control aerial robotic systems.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI-A Related work\\n\\n\\nMobile robotic systems have seen significant advancements with the integration of knowledge-based systems, which enhance their decision-making and adaptability in dynamic environments. Various approaches have been explored in this domain, each one leveraging distinct methodologies and technologies to improve robotic autonomy and efficiency. This section delves into the diverse landscape of mobile robotic systems incorporating knowledge-based systems, highlighting key innovations, methodologies, and their respective contributions to the field.\\n\\n\\nCognitive architectures are comprehensive, computational frameworks designed to model the structures and processes of human cognition. These architectures serve as blueprints for understanding and replicating the intricacies of human thought, encompassing perception, memory, reasoning, and learning. They provide a unified platform for developing intelligent agents capable of performing complex tasks, offering significant advancements in fields ranging from robotics to human-computer interaction.\\n\\n\\nSOAR [4], was the first cognitive architecture integrated into real robots and used with multiple robots [1]. Its basic architecture is established by representing the state of an environment through a graph composed of discrete objects and continuous properties. This allows for a set of predicates to be independent and fixed within the architecture, while the decisions regarding which predicates should be extracted are determined by the specific task that an agent must perform [5].\\n\\n\\nACT-R [8] models human cognition by integrating symbolic and subsymbolic processing. Symbolic processing includes declarative memory, which stores knowledge as chunks (data and facts) with labels (slots), and procedural memory, which holds production rules in \\u201dif-then\\u201d statements to guide behavior based on current goals. Subsymbolic processing operates using a connectionist model, resolving conflicts by selecting the chunk with the highest activation level, determined by past utility and context relevance. Through cycles of perception, cognition, and action, ACT-R adapts to changing environments and tasks, effectively storing and managing knowledge.\\n\\n\\nLIDA [3], provides adaptation and continuous learning by utilizing a multilayer working memory system. Each layer within this system has a distinct purpose and stores various types of information: perceptual, declarative, memory, and procedural. Active working memory serves as the interface that connects all these layers, allowing for the manipulation of stored information. LIDA employs a distributed representation where information is encoded through the activation patterns of artificial neural networks, offering a robust mechanism for adapting to dynamic environments.\\n\\n\\nAside from cognitive architectures, other systems focus more specifically on concrete knowledge representation methods. These methods, used in modern advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and neural networks, often emphasize structured data storage, pattern recognition, and internal learned representations.\\n\\n\\nThe proposed ontology structure by [9] comprises three hierarchical layers where each layer regards more specific knowledge than the former: a metaontology that represents generic concepts, an ontology schema defining domain-specific knowledge, and an ontology instance that captures specific information about individual objects and their attributes. These layers are organized into six classes: Feature, Object, Actor, Space, Context, and Action, each with varying levels of detail. This structure provides a comprehensive, object-oriented, and frame-based language while the hierarchical structure that allows for knowledge to be effectively used through reasoning.\\n\\n\\nThe system proposed in [6] utilizes a knowledge-based system that integrates explicit expert knowledge with implicit learned knowledge, allowing the system to update its model based on the acquired information continuously. Through a knowledge acquisition module explicit knowledge provided by the operator is captured and converted into machine-readable form and then integrated with implicit knowledge. Implicit knowledge is captured by training a model to imitate the adjustments made by the operator, ultimately leading to full automation of robot programming. By learning from the operator\\u2019s adjustments, the system enhances its flexibility, adaptability, and performance, addressing the challenges of industrial robot programming and improving overall efficiency in production processes.\\n\\n\\nKnowledge Graphs (KG) were first introduced in [10] and later popularized by Google, and have evolved significantly, becoming powerful tools for structuring and managing complex relationships between data in various fields, including autonomous systems and robotics. In [7], authors discuss the use of KGs in enhancing robot manipulation tasks. They introduce a multi-layer knowledge-representation model that incorporates various elements such as scenes, objects, agents, tasks, actions, and skills. This hierarchical structure allows for a more nuanced understanding of manipulation tasks compared to traditional flat representations. The authors propose a heterogeneous graph-embedding method that assigns different weights to various relations within the KG to enhance reasoning capabilities. This approach allows the system to differentiate the significance of different connections, facilitating more nuanced reasoning about how various factors influence manipulation tasks.\\n\\n\\nCompared to traditional cognitive architectures, KGs offer a more flexible and scalable approach to representing information. While cognitive architectures are highly specialized in replicating human-like reasoning and learning, they are limited in adaptability across various tasks or domains. KGs, in contrast, provide a dynamic, interconnected representation of entities and their relationships, allowing for more granular, real-time information querying and updating.\\n\\n\\n\", \"II METHODOLOGY\": \"\\n\\nII METHODOLOGY\\n\\n\\nFigure 1: A full overview of the described methodology. Circles represent each step described in the proposed methodology while rectangular boxes contain the outcomes of each step.\\n\\n\\nThe proposed methodology\\u2019s objective is to integrate KGs into ROS 2 systems providing a structured approach for leveraging the full potential of KGs, thus enabling more informed decision-making and improved mission performance in diverse ROS 2 based applications. This methodology is composed of several key steps: defining initial and target conditions, structuring tasks and sub-tasks, planning their sequence, representing task-related data in a KG, and designing the mission using a high-level language. Each step builds on the previous one, ensuring a cohesive process from initial setup to final execution. A full overview of the methodology is shown in Figure 1.\\n\\n\\n\\nII-A Definition\\n\\n\\nIn the definition step, initial conditions of the mission and expected outcomes are defined. This foundational step involves a thorough understanding of the mission\\u2019s goals and constraints, providing a clear vision of the desired outcomes. This step aims to establish a baseline against which the subsequent steps will be measured, ensuring that all efforts align with the ultimate mission objectives.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII-B Structuring\\n\\n\\nThe structuring step involves breaking down the mission into a detailed list of tasks necessary to achieve the defined target conditions. Each task is further subdivided into sub-tasks, with a focus on identifying and specifying the inputs and outputs associated with each sub-task, helping to understand essential activities, their interconnections, and decision points necessary for mission success. These inputs and outputs form the foundational elements necessary for a robust mission and will be mapped to the KG in a later step.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII-C Planning\\n\\n\\nOnce the tasks and sub-tasks are defined, the planning step requires establishing a valid sub-tasks ordering. This ordering should reflect a logical sequence that ensures all prerequisites are met before moving on to subsequent tasks. The primary goal in this step is to verify that the proposed sequence will effectively lead to the achievement of the mission\\u2019s target conditions as outlined in the definition step. A well-ordered plan serves as a roadmap for the subsequent stages, facilitating smooth execution and integration.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII-D Representation\\n\\n\\nThe representation step involves mapping the inputs and outputs of each sub-task to a KG representation. This step is critical for translating the relevant data identified through the task list into a form that can be effectively utilized within the KG framework. By aligning the inputs and outputs with the KG, it is ensured that the necessary information is available and properly organized for efficient querying and control.\\n\\n\\n\\nII-D1 Knowledge Extraction\\n\\nTo apply this methodology to any given ROS 2 based system, it is essential to design a data extraction method tailored to the system\\u2019s specific architecture, data sources and domain ensuring accurate and efficient information retrieval.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII-D2 Concept Design\\n\\nDuring the concept design step, the designer should define how the data will be represented as distinct entities and identify the relationships that connect these entities in the KG. Accurately mapping the data to the KG is essential to ensure that the KG properly represents the system\\u2019s components and their interactions. This alignment is crucial for the system\\u2019s decisions and actions to be consistent with its overall goals.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII-D3 Knowledge Mapping\\n\\nIn this phase, mechanisms are developed to transform raw data into a structured format compliant with the entities and relationships defined in the concept design stage. Given that the methodology is designed to be applied to any ROS 2 system, it is essential to customize these mechanisms to fit the specific system in use.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII-E Mission Design\\n\\n\\nWith the KG structure established, a high-level language is used to specify the mission during this step, including detailed control sequences and queries to interact with the KG. This enables the robot to execute the mission autonomously, with continuous mapping of inputs and outputs to the KG to adapt to changes and make informed decisions. Additionally, during this step, the designer should validate that the specified mission produces the outcomes defined in the definition step.\\n\\n\\n\", \"III ROS 2 KG Implementation\": \"\\n\\nIII ROS 2 KG Implementation\\n\\n\\nOne of the most relevant parts of the methodology is the representation step, which involves the knowledge representation within the KG. To deal with the issues that arise from the handling of knowledge, we have developed different ROS 2 modules that can be used to integrate knowledge graphs into an existing ROS 2 based system. These modules fulfill three main functions:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nKnowledge Base: A ROS 2 node that is in charge of storing the KG data. This node allows for inserting, querying, and deleting both nodes in the KG and edges between them. Additionally, these KG nodes can also store numerical values in terms of properties, which can be quite useful in the robotics domain.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nKnowledge Extractors: These components are different ROS 2 nodes in charge of interfacing with the current robotic system to be able to extract the relevant knowledge to be added to the KG. Those ROS 2 nodes subscribe to the different available topics and process the published data to generate knowledge. Additionally, they also handle data already contained in the KG to generate new knowledge.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\n\\nKnowledge Retrievers: These components allow to query the KG about the entities contained within it and the relationships between them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn terms of software architecture, the knowledge base ROS 2 node centralizes all the information related to the system, while the extractor and retriever ROS 2 nodes interact with it in an N-to-1 fashion during the execution of a given mission.\\n\\n\\nAdditionally, to handle multi-agent missions, the software generates a local KG for each agent and then merges them into a single KG ensuring there are no duplicate entities. This strategy allows each drone to perform independent missions, reducing read and reaction times. For example, when two drones share airspace, the shared KG benefits mission execution by including entities such as the operator\\u2019s position or flight status. Furthermore, the drones can infer new knowledge, such as the relative position between them (e.g., \\u201dclose\\u201d)\\n\\n\", \"IV USE CASE: SEARCH AND RESCUE SCENARIO\": \"\\n\\nIV USE CASE: SEARCH AND RESCUE SCENARIO\\n\\n\\nIn this section, the objective is to test the proposed methodology and the software tools developed during this work in a multi-drone search and rescue mission.\\n\\n\\nThe original robotic system that we will improve using KGs is Aerostack2. Aerostack2 is an open-source software framework designed to create autonomous multi-robot aerial systems. Its modular architecture and multi-robot orientation make it a versatile platform-independent environment capable of addressing a wide range of capabilities for autonomous operation. ROS 2, on the other hand, is an evolution of the popular Robot Operating System (ROS), designed to overcome the limitations of its predecessor. It provides tools, libraries, and conventions for building complex robotic systems and supports multiple programming languages, making it accessible to a wide variety of developers.\\n\\n\\nThe presented use case involves a mission where a set of drones must locate a target in an environment. This mission will be simulated in a Gazebo environment as shown in Figure 2, with the drones autonomously executing the mission using Aerostack2. Knowledge extractors specifically tailored for Aerostack2 will be employed as described in Section III and Figure 3 to enable efficient knowledge handling, integrating the KG capabilities into Aerostack2. This setup will demonstrate how the drones, powered by the advanced knowledge representation and decision-making processes, can effectively carry out the mission in a simulated scenario.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: The Gazebo simulation environment.\\n\\n\\nFigure 3: A graphical view of the application of the methodology to enhance Aerostack2. Green components are the ones introduced to the system through the application of the methodology, while blue ones are related to Aerostack2. Knowledge extraction is allocated in each one of the agents, while the knowledge base and the knowledge retrievers are centralized.\\n\\n\\nDefinition Stage: The mission objective is to inspect a specific area and determine the location of a desired object. The requirements are two drones that can execute autonomous flights, able to perceive their environment, and locate the object of interest. Additionally, the drones must have the capability to continuously monitor the state of their battery and their own location.\\n\\n\\nThis mission aims to evaluate the behavior of the KG both when a single agent knowledge is introduced and when the knowledge expected by multiple agents is integrated into a unified graph. This evaluation will allow us to determine the efficiency and effectiveness of the KG in situations with varying levels of complexity and coordination among multiple autonomous agents.\\n\\n\\nStructuring Stage: The mission can be divided into two main tasks: traversing a defined area and searching for an object, in addition to the tasks responsible for the continuous monitoring of the drones. The full list of identified tasks and sub-tasks is presented in Table I.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTask\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSub-task\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTraverse a defined area\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDetermine the current position of the agent\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCurrent position of each drone\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDetermine the required route to cover the remaining area\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCurrent position of each drone\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRemaining path to cover the area\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSearch and localization of the object\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCapture environmental information\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUse onboard cameras\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRecognize the desired object in the camera image\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCamera image\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLabel the image as contains or does not contain the object\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDrone supervision\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBattery status\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHigh or low level\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelative position between drones\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClose or not close\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMaintain position or move\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNavigation status\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLanded/Flying\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable I: Tasks and sub-tasks identified for the mission consisting of locating a person in an environment.\\n\\n\\nPlanning Stage: Initially, each drone operates independently. The first task is to check its battery status to ensure mission continuity. This check must be performed periodically throughout the mission; if a low battery level is detected, an emergency landing must be carried out if the drone has already taken off, or the takeoff must be prevented if it has not. Additionally, the other drone will take on the responsibility of inspecting the entire area.\\n\\n\\nAfter verifying the battery, the drone will take off and head to its inspection area, where it will start sweeping the zone. If it detects the individual, it will send a signal and wait for the other drone to approach so that they can send the individual\\u2019s coordinates to the operator. Conversely, if the drone does not locate the individual but receives a signal from the other drone, it will halt its trajectory and proceed to the indicated position.\\n\\n\\nFinally, if neither drone locates the individual, both will complete the inspection of their respective areas and return to the origin station, where they will proceed to land.\\n\\n\\nRepresentation Stage:\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nKnowledge Extraction: With the necessary parameters and information for successful mission execution determined by an expert technician, the next step is to extract and maintain this knowledge. Utilizing Aerostack2, we can subscribe to relevant topics like position and battery status, ensuring that these data are continuously updated and readily available for accurate and reliable mission execution.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nConcept Design: The identified entities in the KG are listed in Table II. Since the relevant knowledge to be stored is related to the current state of each drone, the most important edges between are the ones connecting the drone to the person to indicate if it has located the person, those linking a drone to a status entity to describe its current activity, and the edges linking drones to other drones to indicate proximity and avoid collisions.

This involves converting the information into entities and relationships that the graph can support. After completing this step, the KG state in the initial situation defined in the mission is shown in Figure 4.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 4: Initial state of the KG. It represents both drones in their respective home stations, with their batteries highly charged and ready to begin the search and rescue mission.\\n\\n\\nMission Design Stage: The planned mission is translated into Python using the tools provided by Aerostack2 and leveraging the capabilities of the KG to perform queries and monitor the current status of the mission at all times.\\nA rule-based system is used, which analyzes sensitive data through queries and generates consequences. Table IV outlines some examples of queries during the mission.

Figure 5 below shows the knowledge graph when the person has been located.\\n\\n\\nFigure 5: After locating the person, the KG should represent the fact that the two drones are close to each other, that one of them has located the person, and that both of them are still flying.\\n\\n\", \"V CONCLUSIONS\": \"\\n\\nV CONCLUSIONS\\n\\n\\nThe proposed methodology for implementing knowledge graphs in ROS 2 systems offers a robust framework for enhancing knowledge management and decision-making in autonomous missions. By systematically defining, structuring, planning, and representing mission-critical tasks, and by tailoring data extraction methods to specific systems, this approach ensures accurate and efficient integration of knowledge graphs. This integration enables more sophisticated data handling and analysis, ultimately improving the system\\u2019s ability to make informed decisions autonomously. Through this methodology, robotic systems can achieve greater reliability, adaptability, and performance in complex mission scenarios.\\n\\n\\nOne of the primary challenges of the proposed methodology is that it places the responsibility on the user to manually design how perceived information is mapped to nodes and edges in the knowledge graph. This task requires careful consideration of how system data, such as sensor readings or mission status, should be represented in the graph structure. While this approach provides flexibility, it can also be complex and time-consuming, as it requires a deep understanding of both the system and the knowledge graph to ensure accurate and meaningful representation.\\n\\n\\nThe practical application of this methodology is demonstrated through a mission to locate a person using drones, implemented within the Aerostack2 framework. By employing the proposed steps, from defining mission objectives to mapping data onto a knowledge graph, the system was able to effectively coordinate drone operations and enhance situational awareness. The structured representation of tasks and the tailored data extraction facilitated precise control and real-time decision-making. This implementation underscores the methodology\\u2019s potential to improve the operational capabilities of autonomous systems, showcasing its effectiveness in a real-world scenario and highlighting its versatility in handling complex missions within the Aerostack2 framework.\\n\\n\\nFuture work could focus on enhancing the methodology and software components by developing new tools to automate the defined steps, thereby streamlining the entire process. Additionally, incorporating support for reasoning methods beyond rule-based approaches, such as probabilistic or machine learning-based reasoning, could improve decision-making capabilities. Experimenting with different knowledge graph implementations would also be valuable to identify the most efficient solutions for real-time computation, further enhancing the system\\u2019s performance and responsiveness.\\n\\n\"}, \"bibliography\": {\"[1]\": \"\\n[1]\\nD.

We introduce FreeFix, a fine-tuning-free approach that pushes the boundary of this trade-off by enhancing extrapolated rendering with pretrained image diffusion models. We present an interleaved 2D-3D refinement strategy, showing that image diffusion models can be leveraged for consistent refinement without relying on costly video diffusion models.

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [18] and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [9] have achieved high-fidelity rendering, with 3DGS in particular becoming the mainstream choice for its real-time rendering capability. However, both methods require densely captured training images, which are often difficult to obtain, and they tend to produce artifacts at extrapolated viewpoints, namely those outside the interpolation range of the training views. These limitations hinder their use in downstream applications such as autonomous driving simulation and free-viewpoint user experiences.\\n\\n\\nRecent work has explored addressing artifacts in extrapolated view rendering with 3DGS. Existing approaches fall into two categories: adding regularization terms during training or augmenting supervision views using generative models. The regularization terms are often derived from 3D priors [48, 52, 10, 50, 32], or additional sensors [21], but they are typically hand-crafted and limited to specific scene types. Moreover, their lack of hallucination capability further restricts their applicability.\\nIn leveraging diffusion models (DMs), some approaches fine-tune them with paired data, e.g., by using sparse LiDAR inputs or extrapolated renderings with artifacts to generate refined images. Many of these methods train on domain-specific datasets, such as those for autonomous driving [41, 36, 20, 35], which inevitably compromises the generalization ability of DMs. More recently, Difix3D+ [37] fine-tunes SD Turbo [25] on a wider range of 3D datasets, improving generalization. However, the substantial effort required to curate 3D data and the high fine-tuning cost make this approach time-consuming and expensive to extend to other DMs.\\nAn alternative line of work seeks to improve extrapolated rendering without fine-tuning, typically by providing extrapolated renderings as guidance during the denoising step. This preserves the generalization capacity of DMs trained on large-scale data, but such methods still lag behind fine-tuned approaches that are specifically adapted to the task.\\n\\n\\nGiven the generalization\\u2013fidelity trade-off, we ask: can extrapolated view rendering be improved with DMs without sacrificing generalization? To address this challenge, we focus on fine-tuning-free methods and enhance their effectiveness for NVS extrapolation. This is achieved with our proposed 2D\\u20133D interleaved refinement strategy combined with per-pixel confidence guidance for fine-tuning-free image refinement. Specifically, given a trained 3DGS, we sample an extrapolated viewpoint, render the 2D image, refine it with a 2D image diffusion model (IDMs), and integrate the refined image back into the 3D scene by updating the 3DGS before proceeding to the next viewpoint.\\nThis interleaved 2D-3D refinement ensures that previously enhanced views inform subsequent 2D refinements and improve multi-view consistency. Importantly, we introduce a confidence-guided 2D refinement, where a per-pixel confidence map rendered from the 3DGS highlights regions requiring further improvement by the 2D DM. This contrasts with previous training-free methods that rely solely on rendering opacity, leaving the DM to identify artifact regions on its own. While our confidence guidance could in principle be applied to video diffusion models (VDMs), advanced video backbones are typically more computationally expensive and use temporal down-sampling, which prevents the direct use of per-pixel guidance. We show that our 2D\\u20133D interleaved optimization strategy achieves consistent refined images without relying on VDMs.\\n\\n\\nOur contribution can be summarized as follows: 1) We propose a simple yet effective approach for enhancing extrapolated 3DGS rendering without the need for fine-tuning DMs, featuring a 2D\\u20133D interleaved refinement strategy and per-pixel confidence guidance. 2) Our method is compatible with various DMs and preserves generalization across diverse scene contents. 3) Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing fine-tuning-free methods and achieves comparable or even superior performance to training-based methods.\\n\\n\", \"2 Related Work\": \"\\n\\n2 Related Work\\n\\nNumerous works have made efforts on improving quality of NVS. In this section, we will discuss related works in NVS and 3D reconstruction. Furthermore, we will explore efforts that improve NVS quality by incorporating priors from geometry, physics or generative models.\\n\\n\\nNovel View Synthesis: \\nNVS aims to generate photorealistic images of a scene from novel viewpoints. Early methods primarily relied on traditional image-based rendering techniques, such as Light Field Rendering [14], Image-Based Rendering [28], and Multi-Plane Image [55, 30]. These approaches typically interpolate between existing views and are often limited by dense input imagery and struggle with complex occlusions. The advent of deep learning revolutionized NVS, led by two major paradigms: NeRF [18] and 3DGS [9]. NeRF implicitly represents a scene and achieves high-quality results, but its training and rendering speeds are slow. In contrast, 3DGS offers rapid training and real-time rendering. However, a significant limitation of 3DGS is the occurrence of visual artifacts in extrapolated views, which are viewpoints far from the training data. These artifacts compromise the realism and geometric fidelity of the synthesized images. Mitigating these artifacts is the focus of this paper.\\n\\n\\nNVS with Geometry Priors: \\nTo enhance the robustness of NVS models and reduce reconstruction ambiguity, many works have introduced geometry priors. These priors provide key information about the scene\\u2019s 3D structure, which can be explicitly provided by external sensors like LiDAR or depth cameras [21, 41, 36, 23, 40, 17, 8]. Other methods utilize strong structural priors often found in real-world scenes, such as the assumption that the ground is a flat plane [52, 10, 5], the sky can be modeled as a dome [4, 43], or that walls and tables in indoor scenes are predominantly orthogonal [48]. These structural assumptions help regularize the reconstruction process. While these geometry priors can mitigate some reconstruction challenges, they often fall short of completely solving the artifact problem in extrapolated views, especially when the initial geometric prior is itself inaccurate.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: Method. FreeFix improves the rendering quality of extrapolated views in 3DGS without fine-tuning DMs, as illustrated in the bottom left of the pipeline. We propose an interleaved strategy that combines 2D and 3D refinement to utilize image diffusion models for generating multi-frame consistent results, as shown at the top of the pipeline. In the 2D refinement stage, we also introduce confidence guidance and overall guidance to enhance the quality and consistency of the denoising results.\\n\\n\\nNVS with Generative Priors: \\nGenerative priors leverage pre-trained generative models to assist NVS tasks, particularly when dealing with data scarcity or missing information. Early works explored using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to improve rendering quality [39, 24, 26], where the GAN\\u2019s discriminator ensured the local realism of synthesized images. More recently, DMs [33, 22, 13, 31, 42, 11, 12, 34] have gained prominence for their powerful generative capabilities. Their application in NVS falls into two main categories. The first involves fine-tuning a pre-trained DM, which has learned powerful priors from datasets [37, 41, 35, 38, 54, 49, 47]. This process adapts the model\\u2019s knowledge to scene-specific appearances but can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. The second category, which aligns with our proposed method, leverages a pre-trained DM as a zero-shot prior without fine-tuning. The key challenge here is determining what part of the rendered image should be used as guidance for the DM, and how to maintain multi-view consistency. Using the opacity channel of the rendered image as guidance is a common but often crude solution [45, 16, 46], as areas with high opacity can still be artifacts. Additionally, ensuring consistency across different novel views using IDMs is a critical problem. While VDMs [33, 31, 42, 11] can inherently handle this, they are often computationally heavy and not suitable for all applications.\\n\\n\", \"3 Method\": \"\\n\\n3 Method\\n\\nThe FreeFix pipeline is illustrated in Fig.\\u00a02.

VDMs are widely used for improving 3DGS [9] because of the inherent capability to apply attention across frames, ensuring multi-frame consistency. However, the temporal attention mechanism also introduces a computational burden,\\nwhich also limits the output length of VDMs, as the computation complexity is quadratic in relation to the sequence length. Furthermore, recent advanced VDMs [42, 11, 31] utilize 3D VAE as their encoder and decoder, which performs temporal down-sampling, making it challenging to apply per-pixel confidence guidance.\\n\\n\\nDue to the above reasons, we select IDMs as the backbone in FreeFix. However, most existing IDMs are not designed for the novel view synthesis task and do not take reference views as input. IP-Adapter [44] accepts image prompts as input, but it is intended for style prompts rather than novel view synthesis. Directly applying IDMs can lead to inconsistency across frames and finally result in blurriness in refined 3DGS. To tackle the problem, we propose an interleaved refining strategy, multi-level confidence guidance, and overall guidance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3 Interleaved Refinement Strategy\\n\\n2D Refinement: \\nAs mentioned in Sec.\\u00a03.1, the trajectory of extrapolated views \\ud835\\udcafext={\\ud835\\udcb10e,\\ud835\\udcb11e,\\u2026,\\ud835\\udcb1me}\\\\mathcal{T}_{\\\\textit{ext}}=\\\\{\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{0},\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{1},...,\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{m}\\\\} in our task definition is intended to be continuous. This continuous trajectory setting ensures that adjacent views \\ud835\\udcb1ie\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i} and \\ud835\\udcb1i+1e\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i+1} undergo only small transformations. A naive approach to keep consistency would be warping pixels from \\ud835\\udcb1ie\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i} to \\ud835\\udcb1i+1e\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i+1} and using DMs for inpainting. However, both rendered depth and predicted depth are not reliable for warping. Instead, we propose an interleaved refining strategy to enhance multi-view consistency.\\n\\n\\nSpecifically, the refining process is interleaved and incremental along the trajectory \\ud835\\udcaf\\\\mathcal{T}. Given the current view \\ud835\\udcb1ie\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i}, the current 3DGS \\ud835\\udca2i\\u22121\\\\mathcal{G}_{i-1} and rendered image \\u2110^ie=\\u03c0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb1ie;\\ud835\\udca2i\\u22121)\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e}_{i}=\\\\pi(\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i};\\\\mathcal{G}_{i-1}), we utilize denoising with guidance, as discussed in Sec.\\u00a03.4, to obtain the fixed image \\u2110^ie,f\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{i}. We also maintain a fixed image set \\u2131i\\u22121={(\\ud835\\udcb10e,\\u2110^0e,f),(\\ud835\\udcb11e,\\u2110^1e,f),\\u2026,(\\ud835\\udcb1i\\u22121e,\\u2110^i\\u22121e,f)}\\\\mathcal{F}_{i-1}=\\\\{(\\\\mathcal{V}_{0}^{e},\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{0}),(\\\\mathcal{V}_{1}^{e},\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{1}),...,(\\\\mathcal{V}_{i-1}^{e},\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{i-1})\\\\}. We refine the current 3DGS \\ud835\\udca2i\\u22121\\\\mathcal{G}_{i-1} to \\ud835\\udca2i\\\\mathcal{G}_{i} by using the training set \\ud835\\udcaet\\u200br\\u200ba\\u200bi\\u200bn\\\\mathcal{S}_{train}, the previous refined view set \\u2131i\\u22121\\\\mathcal{F}_{i-1} and the current refined image \\u2110^ie,f\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{i}.\\n\\n\\n3D Refinement: \\nThe supervision during 3D Refinement for \\ud835\\udca2i\\\\mathcal{G}_{i} comes from current refined view (\\ud835\\udcb1ie,\\u2110^ie,f)(\\\\mathcal{V}_{i}^{e},\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{i}), \\u2131i\\u22121\\\\mathcal{F}_{i-1} and St\\u200br\\u200ba\\u200bi\\u200bnS_{train}. The detailed sampling strategy for training is illustrated in the supplements.\\n\\n\\nThe generated results do not guarantee 3D consistency with training views, so we employ a smaller training loss for the generated views to prevent inaccurately generated areas from distorting 3D scenes. Additionally, the generated results exhibit slightly color bias compared to training views, which are often difficult for humans to distinguish. However, when applying the interleaved refining strategy, these slight color biases will accumulate, which may lead to a blurry and over-gray effect. We implement a simple yet efficient technique similar to [53] to tackle the problem. For each generated view, we define two optimizable affine matrices \\ud835\\udc9cf\\u2208\\u211d3\\u00d73\\\\mathcal{A}_{f}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{3\\\\times 3} and \\ud835\\udc9cb\\u2208\\u211d3\\u00d71\\\\mathcal{A}_{b}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{3\\\\times 1}. The rendering results used for computing the training loss are applied to these affine matrices to avoid learning color bias:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2110^e\\u2032=\\ud835\\udc9cf\\u00d7\\u2110e^+\\ud835\\udc9cb\\\\displaystyle\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e^{\\\\prime}}=\\\\mathcal{A}_{f}\\\\times\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}^{e}}+\\\\mathcal{A}_{b}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2112=(1\\u2212\\u03bbs)\\u200b\\u2016\\u2110^e\\u2032\\u2212\\u2110^e,f\\u20161+\\u03bbs\\u200bSSIM\\u200b(\\u2110^\\u2032,\\u2110^e,f)\\\\displaystyle\\\\mathcal{L}=(1-\\\\lambda_{s})||\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e^{\\\\prime}}-\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}||_{1}+\\\\lambda_{s}\\\\textit{SSIM}(\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{{}^{\\\\prime}},\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f})\\n\\n(4)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRendered RGB w Artifacts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u03b3c=0.001\\\\gamma_{c}=0.001\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u03b3c=0.01\\\\gamma_{c}=0.01\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u03b3c=0.1\\\\gamma_{c}=0.1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 4: Multi-Level Certainty Masks. FreeFix employs multiple \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} to obtain multi-level certainty masks as guidance. Each level of mask guides a different stage of denoising. A small \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} with high overall certainty is used for the early stages of denoising, while a large \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} which offers greater accuracy, is applied during the later stages of denoising.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4 Denoising with Guidance\\n\\nGiven the rendered results of an extrapolated view, even though the image contains artifacts, most areas can still be regarded as photo-realistic rendering results. These regions with relatively high fidelity can provide essential information for generating an image free of artifacts, while maintaining almost the same content.\\n\\n\\nExperiments in Difix3D+ [37] have demonstrated that adding noise to images with artifacts and directly applying denoising using DMs can effectively remove these artifacts; however, the strength of the added noise is quite sensitive. For regions with significant artifacts, a larger scale of noise is needed to repaint those areas, while a smaller scale of noise is sufficient for areas with minimal artifacts. Although it may seem intuitive to apply different levels of noise to different regions, this approach does not align the data distribution of DMs. Instead, employing guidance during the diffusion denoising step is more practical and has been widely adopted in [16, 45].\\n\\n\\nConfidence Map: \\nUtilizing appropriate guidance is an effective method for generating high-fidelity images while preserving accurate rendering results. However, current approaches that use warp masks or rendering opacities as guidance weights do not account for the presence of artifacts. For example, as illustrated in Fig.\\u00a03 (a), even when severe artifacts are present, the rendering opacities remain high, indicating that these artifacts continue to act as strong guidance during the denoising process.\\nTo tackle this issue, we propose utilizing confidence masks as guidance weights, as shown in Fig.\\u00a03 (c). The confidence scores are derived from Fisher information, which is also referenced in [7, 6]. Specifically, Fisher information measures the amount of information that the observation (x,y)(x,y) carries about the unknown parameters ww that model pf\\u200b(y|x;w)p_{f}(y|x;w). In the context of novel view synthesis, Fisher information can be defined as:\\n\\n\\n\\npf\\u200b(\\u03c0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)|\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)p_{f}(\\\\pi(\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})|\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})\\n\\n(5)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udcb1\\\\mathcal{V} and \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G} represent viewpoint and 3DGS respectively, while \\u03c0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)\\\\pi(\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}) denotes the volume rendering results at the specific view \\ud835\\udcb1\\\\mathcal{V}.\\n\\n\\nThe negative log likelihood of Fisher information in Eq.\\u00a05, which serves as the uncertainty \\ud835\\udc9e\\u00af\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{\\\\bar{C}}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}} of \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G} at view \\ud835\\udcb1\\\\mathcal{V}, can be approximately derived as a Hessian matrix, the detailed derivation can be found in the supplementary materials:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9e\\u00af\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\\\displaystyle\\\\mathcal{\\\\bar{C}}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}\\n=\\u2212log\\u2061pf\\u200b(\\u03c0|\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)\\\\displaystyle=-\\\\log p_{f}(\\\\pi|\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n=\\ud835\\udc07\\u2032\\u2032\\u200b[\\u03c0|\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2]\\\\displaystyle=\\\\mathbf{H}^{{}^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}}[\\\\pi|\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n=\\u2207\\ud835\\udca2\\u03c0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)T\\u200b\\u2207\\ud835\\udca2\\u03c0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)\\\\displaystyle=\\\\nabla_{\\\\mathcal{G}}\\\\pi(\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})^{T}\\\\nabla_{\\\\mathcal{G}}\\\\pi(\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})\\n\\n(6)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[7, 6] renders the attribute \\ud835\\udc9e\\u00af\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{\\\\bar{C}}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}} in volume rendering to obtain the uncertainty map. However, uncertainty is not a numerically stable representation, as its value can range from [0,+\\u221e)[0,+\\\\infty). As illustrated in Fig.\\u00a03 (b), the numeric instability of uncertainty may render an inaccurate uncertainty map. This often occurs when there are Gaussians with low opacity and high uncertainty, which can overwhelm the volume rendering. Instead, we use the complementary value as guidance, certainty \\ud835\\udc9e\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}, also referred to as confidence in this paper, which has a stable numeric range of [0,1][0,1].\\nThe certainty \\ud835\\udc9e\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\u03b3c\\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}^{\\\\gamma_{c}} is defined as:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9e\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\u03b3c=exp\\u2061[\\u2212\\u03b3c\\u200b\\ud835\\udc9e\\u00af\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2]\\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}^{\\\\gamma_{c}}=\\\\exp[-\\\\gamma_{c}\\\\mathcal{\\\\bar{C}}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}]\\n\\n(7)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} is a hyperparameter.

The larger the value of \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c}, the more sensitive the rendered confidence map becomes to artifacts. Selecting a single appropriate \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} is not trivial. Therefore, we apply multi-level confidence maps as guidance. Since DMs generate a coarse structure of image rather than detailed appearance in the early denoising stages [27], we provide \\u2133\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\u03b3c\\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}^{\\\\gamma_{c}} with a small \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} to offer more comprehensive guidance. In the later denoising stages, DMs tend to generate detailed appearances, so we provide \\u2133\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\u03b3c\\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}^{\\\\gamma_{c}} with a large \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} to ensure that the guidance is sufficiently accurate.\\n\\n\\nConfidence Guidance: \\nGiven the rendered image I^\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\\\hat{I}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}} and the corresponding confidence map \\u2133\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\u03b3c\\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}^{\\\\gamma_{c}}, we can provide denoising guidance to DMs.\\nWe denote the rendered image after VAE encoding as x0rx_{0}^{r}, and the resized confidence map that aligns with the shape of the latent space as \\u2133c\\\\mathcal{M}^{c}. As illustrated in Eq.\\u00a02, the predicted x0tx_{0}^{t} at tt timestep is given by xt\\u2212\\u03c3t\\u200b\\ud835\\udd3d\\u03b8\\u200b(xt,t)x_{t}-\\\\sigma_{t}\\\\mathbb{F}_{\\\\theta}(x_{t},t). We guide the model prediction as x0t,gx_{0}^{t,g} by blending the rendered image using confidence mask:\\n\\n\\n\\nx0t,g=\\u2133c\\u2299x0r+(1\\u2212\\u2133c)\\u2299x0tx_{0}^{t,g}=\\\\mathcal{M}^{c}\\\\odot x_{0}^{r}+(1-\\\\mathcal{M}^{c})\\\\odot x_{0}^{t}\\n\\n(9)\\n\\n\\nHowever, the input for the next denoising step cannot be directly obtained using Eq.\\u00a03 since the model prediction x0tx_{0}^{t} has been changed. Instead, we derive the new xt\\u22121x_{t-1} by solving the following equations:\\n\\n\\n\\nxt\\u22121\\\\displaystyle x_{t-1}\\n=x0+\\u03c3t\\u22121\\u200b\\ud835\\udd3d\\u03b8\\u200b(xt,t)\\\\displaystyle=x_{0}+\\\\sigma_{t-1}\\\\mathbb{F}_{\\\\theta}(x_{t},t)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nxt\\u22121\\\\displaystyle x_{t-1}\\n=xt+(\\u03c3t\\u22121\\u2212\\u03c3t)\\u200b\\ud835\\udd3d\\u03b8\\u200b(xt,t)\\\\displaystyle=x_{t}+(\\\\sigma_{t-1}-\\\\sigma_{t})\\\\mathbb{F}_{\\\\theta}(x_{t},t)\\n\\n(10)\\n\\n\\nThe representation of xt\\u22121x_{t-1} derived from x0t,gx_{0}^{t,g} and xtx_{t} is:\\n\\n\\n\\nxt\\u22121=\\u03c3t\\u22121\\u03c3t\\u200bxt\\u2212\\u03c3t\\u22121\\u2212\\u03c3t\\u03c3t\\u200bx0t,gx_{t-1}=\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{t-1}}{\\\\sigma_{t}}x_{t}-\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{t-1}-\\\\sigma_{t}}{\\\\sigma_{t}}x_{0}^{t,g}\\n\\n(11)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOverall Guidance: \\nAlthough the interleaved refining strategy provides higher fidelity rendering results and ensures that the rendering is more consistent with the generated content, using IDMs may still encounter issues of inconsistency in areas with low confidence. Particularly in regions with weak textures like ground and sky, the confidence map tends to be low, and allowing denoising to proceed freely in these areas can result in high inconsistency and blurriness in 3DGS. To address this issue, we propose an overall guidance approach, which combines confidence guidance in the very early stages of denoising to provide structural hints for the images.\\nThe combination of certainty and overall guidance is defined as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\nx0t,g=\\\\displaystyle x_{0}^{t,g}=\\n\\u2133c\\u2299x0r+\\\\displaystyle\\\\mathcal{M}^{c}\\\\odot x_{0}^{r}+\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(1\\u2212\\u2133c)\\u2299(\\u03b2\\u200b\\u2133\\u03b1\\u200bx0r+(1\\u2212\\u03b2\\u200b\\u2133\\u03b1)\\u200bx0t)\\\\displaystyle(1-\\\\mathcal{M}^{c})\\\\odot(\\\\beta\\\\mathcal{M}^{\\\\alpha}x_{0}^{r}+(1-\\\\beta\\\\mathcal{M}^{\\\\alpha})x_{0}^{t})\\n\\n(12)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u03b2\\\\beta is a hyperparameter that controls the strength of the overall guidance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLLFF [19]\\n\\n\\nMip-NeRF 360 [1]\\n\\n\\nWaymo \\u2009 [29]\\n\\nDM Type\\nw/o Finetune\\nOnly RGBs\\n3D Render\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPSNR\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nSSIM\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nLPIPS\\u2193\\\\downarrow\\n\\n\\nPSNR\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nSSIM\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nLPIPS\\u2193\\\\downarrow\\n\\n\\nKID\\u2193\\\\downarrow\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3DGS [9]\\n\\n18.10\\n0.633\\n0.265\\n21.83\\n0.643\\n0.239\\n0.155\\nN/A\\nN/A\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\nFreeFix + SDXL\\n19.93\\n0.695\\n0.237\\n22.68\\n0.685\\n0.213\\n0.150\\nImage\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\nFreeFix + Flux\\n20.12\\n0.700\\n0.221\\n23.02\\n0.689\\n0.208\\n0.147\\nImage\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\n\\nViewExtrapolator [16]\\n\\n18.27\\n0.614\\n0.338\\n20.84\\n0.591\\n0.332\\n0.180\\nVideo\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\n\\nNVS-Solver [45]\\n\\n11.99\\n0.351\\n0.560\\n12.45\\n0.266\\n0.631\\n0.289\\nVideo\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2718\\n\\n\\n\\nDifix3D+ [37]\\n\\n18.86\\n0.658\\n0.239\\n22.43\\n0.661\\n0.210\\n0.143\\nImage\\n\\u2718\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\n\\nStreetCrafter [41]\\n\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\n0.157\\nVideo\\n\\u2718\\n\\u2718\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 1: Quantitative Comparison with Baselines.

We select LLFF [19] as the evaluation dataset for forward-facing scenes, Mip-NeRF 360 [1] for object-centric scenes, and Waymo [29] for driving scenes.\\nFor the LLFF and MipNeRF datasets, which contain relatively dense captured images, we select sparse or partially observed views as the training set and choose an extrapolated view trajectory that is distant from the views in the training set. The Waymo dataset only provides captured images from a single pass down the street, making it relatively sparse. We only utilize the front cameras as the training set and then translate or rotate the training cameras to create the test views. Details on the design of the training and testing views are provided in the supplementary materials.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWaymo / 143481\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWaymo / 177619\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3DGS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nViewExtrapolator [45]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStreetCrafter [41]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDifix3D+ [37]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFreeFix\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 7: Qualitative Comparisons on Waymo [29]. FreeFix provide superior performance compared to ViewExtrapolator and StreetCrafter, and is comparable to Difix3D+ in the Waymo dataset. In some cases, FreeFix refines the scene even better than Difix3D+.\\n\\n\\n\\nModel Settings and Baselines: \\nFreeFix utilizes two powerful IDMs as its backbone: SDXL [22] and Flux [13], to showcase the capabilities of our method.\\nFor baseline selection, we consider various methods with different settings. For fine-tuning-free methods, we select ViewExtrapolator [16], and NVS-Solver [45] as the baseline. While ViewExtrapolator refines 3DGS with generated views like ours, NVS-Solver employs VDMs as the final renderer, without using 3D renderers, which consumes more computational resources during rendering.\\nFor methods that require fine-tuning of DMs, we choose Difix3D+ [37] and StreetCrafter [41] as baselines. StreetCrafter focuses on urban scenes and requires both LiDAR and RGB observations as input, while Difix3D+ is more generalizable and only requires RGB images. For all methods with a 3D renderer, we apply nearly the same 3D refining steps, ensuring that there are sufficient refining steps for the models to converge.\\n\\n\\nEvaluation Metrics: \\nFor the experiments on LLFF and MipNeRF, we adopt the most common settings for quantitative assessments, which include the evaluation of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS [51]. In the case of the Waymo dataset, where no ground truth is available for the test images, we utilize KID [2] for quantitative assessments.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.1 Comparison with Baselines\\n\\nWe evaluate FreeFix using SDXL [22] and Flux [13] as the diffusion backbone on the LLFF, Mip-NeRF 360, and Waymo datasets. This includes a quantitative comparison in Tab.\\u00a01 and qualitative comparisons in Fig.\\u00a05 and Fig.\\u00a07 against baseline methods. Although FreeFix utilizes only IDMs as the backbone and does not require fine-tuning of the DMs, it still demonstrates performance that is comparable to, or even surpasses, methods that use VDMs or require fine-tuning, both in quantitative and qualitative assessments.\\n\\n\\nSpecifically, ViewExtrapolator [16], which uses opacity masks as guidance, shows slight improvements in LLFF, although the improvement is less significant compared to our confidence-guided solution.\\nMoreover, it fails to provide improvements in Mip-NeRF 360 and Waymo.\\nThis is due to the fact that ViewExtrapolator uses the nearest view from a set of training views as the reference view to generate the test views in a video diffusion model.\\nWhile using the nearest training view as the reference view in SVD performs well in the forward-facing scenes in LLFF, where the test views are closer to the training views, this is usually not the case for Mip-NeRF 360 and Waymo, hence ViewExtrapolator yields degraded performance.\\n\\n\\nDifix3D+ demonstrates the most generalizability and powerful performance across our baselines. FreeFix surpasses Difix3D+ [37] in LLFF and Mip-NeRF 360, while providing comparable performance in Waymo.\\nWe attribute this to the generalizability of DMs. Although Difix3D+ is finetuned on DLV3D [15] and may have encountered similar scenes to those in LLFF and Mip-NeRF 360, the domain gap between datasets still weakens the generalizability of Difix3D+. In contrast, our method maintains the original generalizability of DMs learned from web-scale datasets. Regarding the Waymo dataset, Difix3D+ is fine-tuned on a large-scale in-house driving dataset, where driving scenes are highly structured and exhibit relatively small inter-class differences, making them easier for models to learn.\\n\\n\\nStreetCrafter [41] is tailored for urban scenes and requires LiDAR as input; for this reason, we only conduct experiments with this model on the Waymo dataset. In contrast to the original setting in StreetCrafter, our setup only provides the front camera to color the LiDAR points, which highlights the limitations of StreetCrafter in this context.\\nNVS-Solver produces less satisfying results compared to other methods, which may be attributed to inaccurate depth estimation and warping results. We provide NVS-Solver results in supplementary materials.\\n\\n\\nPlease note that we compute the average score across scenes for each dataset. We provide a quantitative comparison for each scene, along with additional qualitative comparisons in the supplementary materials.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.2 Ablation Study\\n\\nImage Diffusion Models vs Video Diffusion Models: \\nFreeFix can also be applied to VDMs without temporal down-sampling, such as SVD [3]. Although SVD offers inherent consistency across frames, it suffers from blurriness compared to more advanced IDMs. We conduct an ablation study on the scene from MipNeRF-360/Garden to provide quantitative and qualitative comparisons in Tab.\\u00a02 and Fig.\\u00a06. Additionally, we include the results from ViewExtrapolator [16] on the same scene. While ViewExtrapolator also uses SVD as its backbone, it employs an opacity mask as guidance, which disentangles the effects of the differences in diffusion model backbones and helps demonstrate the effectiveness of our confidence guidance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPSNR\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nSSIM\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nLPIPS\\u2193\\\\downarrow\\n\\nGuidance\\n\\n\\n3DGS\\n18.38\\n0.415\\n0.357\\nN/A\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVE [16] + SVD\\n\\n17.86\\n0.409\\n0.505\\nOpacity\\n\\n\\nFreeFix + SVD\\n19.03\\n0.453\\n0.331\\nCertainty\\n\\n\\nFreeFix + SDXL\\n19.41\\n0.517\\n0.294\\nCertainty\\n\\n\\nFreeFix + Flux\\n19.72\\n0.520\\n0.287\\nCertainty\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 2: Quantitative Ablation on Diffusion Models Selection. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPSNR\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nSSIM\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nLPIPS\\u2193\\\\downarrow\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRaw Flux [13]\\n\\n19.23\\n0.390\\n0.389\\n\\n\\n+ Confidence Guidance\\n19.32\\n0.435\\n0.349\\n\\n\\n+ Interleave Strategy\\n19.65\\n0.517\\n0.293\\n\\n\\n+ Overall Guidance\\n19.72\\n0.520\\n0.287\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 3: Ablation Study on Modules of FreeFix. We incorporate each module from the raw Flux model to illustrate its necessity. \\n\\n\\nEffectiveness of Interleaved 2D-3D Refinement: \\nThe interleaved refining strategy, confidence guidance, and overall guidance are crucial for ensuring that the generation aligns with the original scenes and enhances consistency across frames. We conduct an ablation study of these modules on the scene from MipNeRF-360/Garden, as shown in Tab.\\u00a03. We perform experiments starting from a raw Flux model, which we slightly modify to function as an image-to-image model. We progressively add components from FreeFix to demonstrate the necessity of these techniques.\\n\\n\\n\", \"5 Conclusion\": \"\\n\\n5 Conclusion\\n\\nIn this paper, we present FreeFix, a method for fixing artifacts and improving the quality of 3DGS without fine-tuning DMs. FreeFix demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across various datasets and possesses strong capabilities for deployment with future, more advanced DMs.\\nHowever, FreeFix still has certain limitations. It may encounter failure cases when extrapolated views lead to excessive artifacts with minimal credible guidance. Additionally, the updating process for 3DGS is relatively slow and challenging to converge over dozens of refining steps. These challenges suggest opportunities for future work on designing more robust and efficient methods for integrating 3D reconstruction with 2D generative models.\\n\\n\\nAcknowledgements:\\nThis work is supported by NSFC under grant 62202418, U21B2004, and 62441223, the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2021ZD0114501, and Scientific Research Fund of Zhejiang University grant XY2025028.\\n\\n\\n\", \"6 3DGS Fisher Information Derivation\": \"\\n\\n6 3DGS Fisher Information Derivation\\n\\nThe uncertainty attribute of 3DGS in this paper is defined as:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9e\\u00af\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2=\\u2212log\\u2061pf\\u200b(\\u03c0|\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)\\\\mathcal{\\\\bar{C}}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}=-\\\\log p_{f}(\\\\pi|\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})\\n\\n(13)\\n\\n\\nUnder the following regularity conditions, \\u2212log\\u2061pf\\u200b(\\u03c0|\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)-\\\\log p_{f}(\\\\pi|\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}) can be viewed as a loss term for Fisher information.

The process for generating testing views in the Waymo dataset is straightforward; we translate the camera by 2 to 3 meters or rotate it by 10 to 15 degrees horizontally. However, the design for LLFF and Mip-NeRF 360 is not as straightforward, as we aim to construct extrapolated views that have ground truth images. For this reason, we cannot generate trajectories freely; instead, we need to create partitions for the testing and training sets. We present visualizations of the training and testing cameras in Fig.\\u00a08 from these scenes to illustrate the design of the extrapolated views. For some scenes where obvious extrapolated trajectories cannot be directly extracted, we aim to make the training views sparse in order to produce relative extrapolated trajectories.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLLFF\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfern\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhorns\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nleaves\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfortress\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntrex\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMip-NeRF 360\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngarden\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstump\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbicycle\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncounter\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nkitchen\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 8: Design of Training and Testing Views Design.

We demonstrate the application of our approach based on the case study of robot cutting of unknown materials. Compared to baseline methods, including our previous work, CycleGAN, and conditional variational autoencoder-based time series translation, our approach achieves improved task completion time and behavioural stability with minimal real-world data. Our framework demonstrates robustness to geometric and material variation, and highlights the feasibility of policy adaptation in challenging contact-rich tasks where real-world reward information is unavailable.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20846v1\", \"timestamp\": 1769625955, \"sections\": {\"Introduction\": \"\\nIntroduction\\n\\nEmerging applications for robotics have fostered increasing interest in low-volume, high-mix disassembly processes in industry. These processes are characterised by a high degree of uncertainty coupled with demands of logistical flexibility, which traditionally implies the requirement for expensive reprogramming and reconfiguration of robots. This is of interest in domains such as nuclear decommissioning, robotic disassembly of complex products for recycling and re-use, and even areas such as robotic surgery or demolition with robotised demolition equipment. Nonetheless, challenges exist in automated planning and task execution for destructive operations. Whereas manufacturing paradigms centre around achieving high dimensional tolerances and precise control on a known workpiece, for disassembly, the precise location of cutting is less important (few mm as opposed to \\u03bc\\\\mum) while the precise sequence of cutting operations may not be known in advance. This uncertainty has motivated various approaches to robotic cutting, consisting of goal-conditioned trial-and-error & revision [25, 26], 3D reconstruction & planning [9], and online learning & adaptation [18, 22].\\n\\n\\nReinforcement learning (RL) has been applied with success to a variety of contact-rich tasks [2, 23], including robotic cutting [31, 15], particularly with difficult-to-model environments with complex robot-environment interactions, but are nonetheless data intensive. Whereas simulation environments offer reduced complexity and overhead of data collection, differences between simulated and physical cutting processes limit the applicability of adaptive methods to real-world tasks. Examples of such differences include motor backlash, tool wear, chattering, cross-domain mismatch of process and model parameters and other disturbances. These differences motivate the use of domain adaptation methods to align representations or behaviours across domains with minimal real-world supervision. These can be broadly separated into unified feature representation learning, model-based correction, and model-free synthesis of target domain examples.\\n\\n\\nDomain adaptive methods include [29] in which policies are trained on a cross-domain latent feature representation by aligning source and target domain distributions. A related concept applied to milling was proposed in [31] based on a cross-domain meta-model, trained on pairwise unified feature representations. Similarly, adversarial losses using domain discriminators have been employed for cross-domain tool wear classification [20]. Reconstruction-based methods have also been employed to jointly model observation and class distributions[12]; this concept has been further developed based on conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs) [33] wherein CVAE feature representations were used to train an RL policy, while feature representations are aligned across domains.\\n\\n\\nModel-based approaches have previously also been employed for domain adaptation, wherein a source domain task model is augmented with a corrective model based on physics-informed approaches [24], neural networks [13, 5] or Gaussian process (GP) models [19, 27] learned from target domain data. In our previous work, [16] we proposed an imitation learning framework in which a GP corrective model was learned from multiple cutting demonstrations. Nonetheless, model-based approaches incur limitations of modelling assumptions under which the models are introduced, and incur a dataset overhead, particularly for deep predictive modelling approaches.\\n\\n\\nRelating to the aforementioned approaches is direct alignment of observations across domains via translation or generative models. In the context of milling, [4] proposed a domain adaptation method for condition monitoring of different milling tools based on a generative CNN. Similarly, [30], proposed a domain adaptive imitation learning framework from visual demonstrations based on CycleGAN [32]. Generation at object level has also been proposed [17] wherein a StyleGAN image translation model is trained object-wise on weakly-paired cross-domain datasets for 6D pose estimation. CVAEs have also been employed for domain adaptation via synthesis of novel target domain examples [28].\\n\\n\\nNeural style transfer has been extensively researched in the context of image processing [11, 10]. Recently, this concept has been extended to motion execution. Thus far, its application has been limited largely to expressive stylised motions mirroring that of human operators [8, 7]. Nonetheless, its applicability to synthesise novel trajectories with characteristics of diverse human operators presents a compelling case for its application to other domain adaptation problems. Recently, this has been applied for dataset augmentation tasks [6]. A limitation of the aforementioned methods is lack of a suitable pairing mechanism for style and content, as well as lack of feature extractor backbones prevalent in image processing tasks. For transfer learning, addressed this problem [3] by building on the concept of conditional adversarial domain adaptation [21] to achieve feature-level style transfer for transfer learning. Nonetheless, adversarial alignment can be difficult to train, with well-known problems of mode collapse and vanishing gradients. Whereas these developments have been applied to time series classification problems, application of style transfer for RL policy transfer is, to the best of our knowledge, largely unexplored.\\n\\n\\nThis paper extends our previous example-based approach for sim-to-real adaptation to arbitrary real world examples. As with our previous work, our approach does not require re-training of classifiers or encoder networks to adapt to new scenarios (different disturbance forces, differing sensor dynamics, etc.). In contrast to prior work that applies neural style transfer primarily for stylised motion synthesis or dataset augmentation, we apply it as a trajectory-level domain adaptation mechanism for robotic skill transfer. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a latent-space pairing mechanism for content and style that operates without paired examples or retraining; (2) a novel transfer framework based on neural style transfer that does not require labelled or reward-supervised data from the target domain; and (3) empirical evaluation on robotic cutting, a task where conventional reinforcement learning pipelines are difficult to apply due to the absence of reward signal in the real-world deployment environment. An overview of our framework is provided in Figure 1.\\n\\n\\nFigure 1: Overview of proposed framework. In the first stage, a simulation of cutting mechanics is used to generate an expert policy and a variational autoencoder (VAE) is trained on simulated trajectory windows. In the second stage, the VAE encoded representations are used to generate pairings between a simulated and real world dataset which are used as style targets. Finally, expert trajectories are used to train a learner target domain policy with the generated observation windows.\\n\\n\", \"Style transfer framework\": \"\\nStyle transfer framework\\n\\nVariational autoencoder\\n\\nThe variational autoencoder (VAE) consists of two neural networks: an encoder q\\u03d5\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc9b|\\ud835\\udc99)q_{\\\\phi}(\\\\boldsymbol{z}|\\\\boldsymbol{x}) that approximates the posterior over latent variables \\ud835\\udc9b\\u2208\\u211dL\\\\boldsymbol{z}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{L}, and a decoder p\\u03b8\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc99|\\ud835\\udc9b)p_{\\\\theta}(\\\\boldsymbol{x}|\\\\boldsymbol{z}) that reconstructs the data from the latent representation.

Training was carried out with the Adam optimiser, with model hyperparameters established via manual search, reported in Table Style transfer. Both encoder and decoder networks were implemented as strided convolutional networks with 3 layers. Batch normalisation was further employed to accelerate convergence and reduce training instability. The encoder architecture is visualised in Figure 2.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: Overview of VAE encoder architecture; layer indices for style transfer are demarcated.\\n\\n\\nThe VAE training dataset consisted of a mixture of 680 on-policy and off-policy simulated trajectories. We consider a trajectory as a multivariate time series of length TT which comprises a sequence of state-action pairs:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u03c4={(\\ud835\\udc99t,\\ud835\\udc9at)}t=1T\\\\tau=\\\\{(\\\\boldsymbol{x}_{t},\\\\boldsymbol{y}_{t})\\\\}_{t=1}^{T}\\n\\n(4)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udc99t\\u2208\\u211dNS\\\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{N_{S}}, \\ud835\\udc9at\\u2208\\u211dNA\\\\boldsymbol{y}_{t}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{N_{A}} are the states, actions at time tt respectively. Each trajectory \\u03c4\\\\tau is divided into overlapping windows of length NN, resulting in a set of state and action windows:\\n\\n\\n\\nx(i)=\\\\displaystyle x^{(i)}=\\n[xt,xt+1,\\u2026,xt+N]\\u2208\\u211dN\\u00d7NS\\\\displaystyle[x_{t},x_{t+1},\\\\dots,x_{t+N}]\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\times N_{S}}\\n\\n(5)\\n\\n\\n\\ny(i)=\\\\displaystyle y^{(i)}=\\n[yt,yt+1,\\u2026,yt+N]\\u2208\\u211dN\\u00d7NA\\\\displaystyle[y_{t},y_{t+1},\\\\dots,y_{t+N}]\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\times N_{A}}\\n\\n(6)\\n\\n\\nThe window width NN and latent code dimensionality emerge as tunable parameters for which a trade-off exists between the temporal context afforded to the model, reproduction accuracy and saliency of the latent space. Through preliminary experiments, this was reflected in increased RMS error of the autoencoder reconstructions and reduced average cosine similarity between simulated and real world embeddings with increasing NN and dimensionality respectively. A window size of N=100N=100 samples (2 seconds) was identified as providing the best trade-off between these factors.\\n\\n\\n\\nPolicy adaptation\\n\\nWe adopt a similar approach to our previous work [16] to adapt a pre-trained policy to observations synthesised from unlabelled target domain data. In this procedure, an \\u201cexpert\\u201d policy \\u03c0e\\\\pi_{e} is initially trained in a simulation environment with a physically-informed cutting model, as introduced in our previous work [14], with model parameters from Table Style transfer. The expert was trained initially for 32000 episodes using the proximal policy optimisation (PPO) algorithm with domain randomisation of material properties. A translation function f:\\u211dN\\u00d7NS\\u2192\\u211dN\\u00d7NAf:\\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\times N_{S}}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\times N_{A}} is applied to each state window:\\n\\n\\n\\nx(g,i)\\u2063\\u2217=f\\u200b(x(c,i))x^{(g,i)*}=f(x^{(c,i)})\\n\\n(7)\\n\\n\\nand translated states paired with the corresponding expert action on x(c)x^{(c)} to generate a labelled dataset\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9f={(x(g,i),\\u03c0e\\u200b(x(c,i)))}.\\\\mathcal{D}=\\\\{(x^{(g,i)},\\\\pi_{e}(x^{(c,i)}))\\\\}.\\n\\n(8)\\n\\n\\nWe subsequently train a target domain policy \\u03c0g\\\\pi_{g}, initialised as \\u03c0g=\\u03c0e\\\\pi_{g}=\\\\pi_{e} on \\ud835\\udc9f\\\\mathcal{D} using behavioural cloning. We note this procedure can be extended to alternative imitation learning algorithms (such as DAgger) provided ff can be inferred during generation of source windows x(c,i)x^{(c,i)}. Under the assumption that the environment satisfies the Markov property, the policy learning process is unaffected by the windowing procedure. As the full trajectories do not need to be reconstructed, limitations of other methods such as requirement for blending or enforcing temporal consistency are inapplicable to this work [7]. Furthermore, as each trajectory is decomposed into T\\u2212N+1T-N+1 windows, the windowing approach has the effect of significantly augmenting the training data.\\n\\n\\n\\nStyle transfer\\n\\nIn this work, we consider neural style transfer[11] as a translation function wherein x(g)\\u2063\\u2217x^{(g)*} arise from solving the style transfer optimisation problem:\\n\\n\\n\\nx(g,i)\\u2063\\u2217=arg\\u2061minx(g,i)\\u2061(wc\\u200bLc\\u200b(x,x(c,i))+ws\\u200bLs\\u200b(x,x(s,j)))x^{(g,i)*}=\\\\arg\\\\min_{x^{(g,i)}}\\\\left(w_{c}L_{c}(x,x^{(c,i)})+w_{s}L_{s}(x,x^{(s,j)})\\\\right)\\n\\n(9)\\n\\n\\nwhere wcw_{c} and wsw_{s} are the content and style weights, respectively and LcL_{c}, LsL_{s} are content and style loss contributions respectively. The content loss is defined as:\\n\\n\\n\\nLc=\\u2211l\\u2211i,j12\\u200bNl\\u200b(Fi\\u200bj(c,l)\\u2212Fi\\u200bj(g,l))2L_{c}=\\\\sum_{l}\\\\sum_{i,j}\\\\frac{1}{2N_{l}}\\\\left(F^{(c,l)}_{ij}-F^{(g,l)}_{ij}\\\\right)^{2}\\n\\n(10)\\n\\n\\nwhere F(c,l)F^{(c,l)}, F(g,l)F^{(g,l)} are the feature outputs of layer ll for the content and generated output respectively. The style loss similarly is expressed as\\n\\n\\n\\nLs=\\u2211l\\u2211i,j14\\u200bNl2\\u200bMl2\\u200b(Gi\\u200bj(s,l)\\u2212Gi\\u200bj(g,l))2L_{s}=\\\\sum_{l}\\\\sum_{i,j}\\\\frac{1}{4N^{2}_{l}M^{2}_{l}}\\\\left(G^{(s,l)}_{ij}-G^{(g,l)}_{ij}\\\\right)^{2}\\n\\n(11)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udc06(s,l)\\\\mathbf{G}^{(s,l)} is the style Gram matrix of layer ll outputs F(s,l)F^{(s,l)}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc06(s,l)=F(s,l)\\u200bF\\ud835\\uddb3\\u200b(s,l)\\\\mathbf{G}^{(s,l)}=F^{(s,l)}F^{\\\\mathsf{T}(s,l)}\\n\\n(12)\\n\\n\\nand similarly for \\ud835\\udc06(c,l)\\\\mathbf{G}^{(c,l)}. The generated windows were initialised as\\n\\n\\n\\nx(g,i)=x(c,i)x^{(g,i)}=x^{(c,i)}\\n\\n(13)\\n\\n\\nand (9) optimised by gradient descent using the Adam optimiser. The relative content-style weighting wc/w\\u200bsw_{c}/w{s} was tuned manually through a grid-search procedure. Figure 3 shows the effect of content-style weighting on their relative loss contributions. At low values of wc/w\\u200bsw_{c}/w{s}, the total loss is dominated by increasing content reconstruction error; the generated windows diverge substantially from the original windows with marginal effect on style reconstruction. Hence, wc/w\\u200bsw_{c}/w{s} was reduced until diminishing returns on the (unweighted) style reconstruction loss was observed. We report relevant optimisation parameters in Table Style transfer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 3: Effect of content-style weight ratio wc/wlw_{c}/w_{l} on normalised (unweighted) content-style loss, averaged over 5 content-style batches (batch size 256), with chosen value wc/ws=0.02w_{c}/w_{s}=0.02 indicated (dotted line). Decreasing ratio results in diminishing returns on style while diverging substantially from the original content windows. Increasing ratio tends towards identity (generated windows correspond to unaltered simulated windows).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 1: Selected hyperparameters for encoder network and style transfer framework.\\n\\n\\n\\nParameter\\nValue\\n\\n\\nEncoder learning rate\\n1\\u00d710\\u221231\\\\times 10^{-3}\\n\\n\\nEncoder output channels\\n[128,256,512]\\\\left[128,256,512\\\\right]\\n\\n\\nEncoder kernel size\\n3\\n\\n\\nEncoder batch size\\n128\\n\\n\\nEncoder kernel stride\\n2\\n\\n\\nWindow size\\n100\\n\\n\\nLatent dimensions\\n130\\n\\n\\nContent-style ratio wc/wsw_{c}/w_{s}\\n\\n0.02\\n\\n\\nStyle transfer learning rate\\n0.01\\n\\n\\nStyle transfer iterations\\n1000\\n\\n\\nContent layer indices (Fig. 2)\\n[x]\\n\\n\\nStyle layer indices (Fig. 2)\\n[2, 5, 7]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 4: Convergence plot for style transfer optimisation with parameters from Table Style transfer for a batch of 256 content-style pairings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 2: Table of model parameters for cutting simulation (source domain)\\n\\n\\n\\nParameter\\nValue\\n\\n\\nPitch angle [rad]\\n0.126\\n\\n\\nHelix angle [rad]\\n0.0\\n\\n\\nRadius [m]\\n0.025\\n\\n\\nCutter width [m]\\n0.0005\\n\\n\\nCutting elements (flutes)\\n50\\n\\n\\nSpindle speed [rpm]\\n1000\\n\\n\\nMaterial cutting\\n\\n\\n\\n-mechanistic constant (KcK_{c}) [N/mm2]\\nvariable\\n\\n\\nMaterial edge\\n\\n\\n\\n-mechanistic constant (KeK_{e}) [N/mm]\\nvariable\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 5: t-SNE embedding diagram of content-style pairings. The points are coloured according to their class (simulation, blue / real world, red) with intensity according to the cosine similarity of their closest match, diverging from 0.5. The area of each real world embedding point is directly proportional to the number of times the corresponding window was matched.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA compelling advantage of encoder or classifier-based approaches is that they operate on unpaired cross-domain datasets. To improve the realism of generated trajectories, we employ a pairing mechanism that takes advantage of the unsupervised feature representations learned from the source domain data to generate weakly paired content and style windows. An intuitive analogue would be matching images with similar composition and subjects, reminiscent of the weak paring mechanism in [17]. In the first stage, the real world dataset is encoded in entirety by the encoder network to generate a dataset of embeddings. In the second stage, the simulated content window(s) are encoded and a content-style pairing matrix is constructed by the pairwise cosine similarity between x(c,i)x^{(c,i)}, x(s,j)x^{(s,j)} representations as\\n\\n\\n\\nSi\\u200bj=zi\\u22c5zj\\u2016zi\\u2016\\u22c5\\u2016zj\\u2016S_{ij}=\\\\frac{z_{i}\\\\cdot z_{j}}{||z_{i}||\\\\cdot||z_{j}||}\\n\\n(14)\\n\\n\\nIn the last stage, the closest match real embedding is paired with the simulated embedding. For each row ii, the index of the most similar pairing was obtained by:\\n\\n\\n\\nj\\u2217\\u200bi=arg\\u2061max\\u2061j,Si\\u200bjj^{*}i=\\\\arg\\\\max{j},S_{ij}\\n\\n(15)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor windows where the pairing diverged substantially from the content, the optimisation process introduced mean shifts into the observations, as well as introducing artefacts from the encoding process. Following the intuition of [10], qualitatively, we observed that pre-aligning the means of the content and style windows resulted in higher quality generated outputs. Figure 5 shows a representation of the content-style pairings generated by the pairing procedure. The data show the formation of distinct clusters according to simulated and real world trajectories. Unsurprisingly, the real world embeddings with the most matches were found predominantly at the intersections of the clusters. This parasitic behaviour is reminiscent of the mode-collapse phenomenon in generative-adversarial networks. Nonetheless, around 50% of real world points were matched at least once, with matched windows dispersed throughout the latents, indicating good coverage of the real world dataset.\\n\\n\\nFor adaptation, 50 episodic trajectories were collected in source domain with the expert policy, which formed the content dataset. For this work, the style dataset consisted of 148 off-policy trajectories collected from the real world. We note this is not a hard requirement; dataset size is motivated primarily by avoiding breakdown of the pairing and style transfer mechanism where content and style windows diverge substantially.\\n\\n\\n\\nExperimental setup\\n\\nAs with our previous work, experimental validation was carried out on a KUKA LBR iiwa R820 14kg collaborative robot equipped with a wrist-mounted motorised slitting saw tool. The iiwa was connected via the Fast Research Interface (FRI) to a Robot Operating System (ROS) workstation with a communication frequency of 500Hz. The workstation consisted of an Intel i7-8086K CPU, NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti GPU with 11GB VRAM, and 32GB RAM. The robot was equipped with a motorised slitting saw tool; whereas geometric parameters of the tool reflect the training parameters in Table Style transfer, the number of teeth was doubled to introduce further cross-domain mismatch.\\n\\n\\nThe cutting task was represented as a single conventional milling pass over an material with variable geometry, following a nominal trajectory defined at the material surface. As proof of principle, the reference path was defined manually with respect to the surface for all case studies. During the cutting task, the policy provides as output a translational stiffness, incremental offset to the depth of cut (DoC), and the feed rate, relative to the planned (nominal) trajectory. The nominal feed rate was chosen as 0.75 m/min. The controller damping gain \\ud835\\udc0ad\\\\mathbf{K}_{d} was adjusted independently according to the stiffness to provide a damping ratio of 1.0 (i.e. critically damped). Trajectory tracking was achieved according to the operational space control law\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udeaa=\\ud835\\udc09\\ud835\\uddb3\\u200b[\\u039b^\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc92)\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc0ad\\u200b(t)\\u200b\\ud835\\udc86\\u02d9+\\ud835\\udc0ap\\u200b(t)\\u200b\\ud835\\udc86)+\\ud835\\udf41^\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc92,\\ud835\\udc92\\u02d9)+\\ud835\\udf46^\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc92)]\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Gamma}=\\\\mathbf{J}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}\\\\left[\\\\hat{\\\\Lambda}(\\\\boldsymbol{q})\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{K}_{d}(t)\\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{e}}+\\\\mathbf{K}_{p}(t)\\\\boldsymbol{e}\\\\right)+\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}}(\\\\boldsymbol{q},\\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{q}})+\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\rho}}(\\\\boldsymbol{q})\\\\right]\\n\\n(16)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udeaa\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Gamma} are the commanded joint torques, \\ud835\\udc09\\\\mathbf{J} the robot Jacobian, and \\u039b^\\\\hat{\\\\Lambda}, \\ud835\\udf41^\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}}, \\ud835\\udf46^\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\rho}} are the estimated operational space inertia matrix, Coriolis & centrifugal forces, and gravitational forces respectively.\\n\\n\\nDuring the cutting task, the process force was monitored via an FT-AXIA 80 force-torque sensor, mounted at the robot wrist. However, our method in principle is applicable to different types of sensors, such as those built in to the iiwa, provided real world examples collected with such sensors. Prior to each trial, the force sensor was biased at the start of the trajectory.

To demonstrate the performance of each method on a range of materials, cutting trials were carried out on polyurethane foam, cardboard, corrugated plastic, mica and aluminium. We further establish 3 separate case studies on each material to evaluate the policy performance under different path planning conditions. We evaluate each method by task completion time, average path deviation, average tool load, material removed volume (MRV), and similarity of the adopted action trajectories to the source domain expert actions, averaged over 5 trials per material for each strategy, and aggregated over all materials. To mitigate effects of drift (e.g. tool wear, temperature, calibration errors), trials for each strategy were interleaved.\\n\\n\\nComparison methods\\n\\nFor the subsequent real world experiments, we adopt the following terminology to denote comparison methods: \\u2018Expert\\u2019 refers to the unadapted source simulation expert policy, as transferred directly to the real world task. \\u2018BC\\u2019, or standalone behavioural cloning, represents our previous work, in which the simulation is augmented with a Gaussian process (GP) regression model trained on aligned demonstrations from 14 preliminary experiments on aluminium and mica. \\u2018CVAE\\u2019 represents a conditional variational autoencoder using the same real world dataset as adopted for style transfer. Note in this instance, the encoder itself is trained on the entire dataset of both real world and simulation data, conditioned on a one-hot domain label (simulation or real world). Simulated data are encoded as with the style transfer approach, however, at decoding time, the one-hot class label is swapped to generate a synthetic window of the desired class. \\u2018CycleGAN\\u2019 is also introduced as a comparison method. In this instance, the surrogate real world dataset is synthesised by the sim-to-real generator network. With all methods, the generator / encoder architecture was chosen equivalent to Table Style transfer. For CycleGAN, a smaller discriminator network, with output channels [64,128,256][64,128,256] was used due to mitigate the well-known \\u2018vanishing gradient\\u2019 problem during GAN training. All other hyperparameters were chosen to be equivalent to the CycleGAN study. All methods were employed with behavioural cloning as per the self-supervision procedure introduced in this work. Additionally, as a benchmark, we include a \\u201cbaseline\\u201d strategy in which the process parameters are held constant at the nominal feed rate (0.75m/min) and depth of cut of 1 mm, applied to all materials.\\n\\n\\n\\nPlanar material case study\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) Flat\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) DoC offset\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(c) Curved\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 7: Boxplot summary of performance metrics for the style transfer trained policy and comparison methods, aggregated over all materials. Metrics include task completion time, average path deviation, average load force, average (normalised) dynamic time warping (DTW) distance between each strategy and the simulation expert policy (lower better), and material removed volume (MRV, higher better).\\n\\n\\nEach strategy was initially tested on a planar material, with the reference path calibrated at the material surface. For the calibration procedure, the surface was modelled as a warped plane interpolated between 4 corner points obtained via guarded move with a force threshold of 1N, with the exception of foam, where contact was confirmed visually. The performance of each strategy for the planar case study is outlined in Figure 7(a). To aid interpretation, the significance of the difference in metrics was tested via one-way ANOVA. The normality and homoscedasticity assumptions of ANOVA were tested via the Shapiro-Wilk and Levene methods respectively. A significance level of \\u03b1=0.05\\\\alpha=0.05 was used for all tests. Metrics that did not satisfy the assumptions were transformed via Box-Cox transform:\\n\\n\\n\\ny={x\\u03bb\\u22121if\\u200b\\u03bb\\u22600log\\u2061(x)otherwisey=\\\\begin{cases}x^{\\\\lambda}-1&\\\\mathrm{if}\\\\,\\\\lambda\\\\neq 0\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\log(x)&\\\\mathrm{otherwise}\\\\end{cases}\\n\\n(18)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u03bb\\\\lambda is chosen to maximise the log-likelihood of the transformed data under a normality assumption. In the case of completion time and average force, the assumptions of ANOVA were satisfied (Shapiro p=0.361p=0.361, p=0.355p=0.355; Levene p=0.0689p=0.0689, p=0.0983p=0.0983, respectively). Average path deviation and MRV did not satisfy the normality assumption after transformation, and in this case the Kruskal-Wallis test was adopted without transformation. For both task completion time and average force, one-way ANOVA revealed significant effects of strategy on performance (F=61.1F=61.1, p=1.14\\u00d710\\u221227p=1.14\\\\times 10^{-27}; F=6.74F=6.74, p=6.52\\u00d710\\u22125p=6.52\\\\times 10^{-5} respectively) between strategy and these performance metrics.\\n\\n\\nTo examine the effect of individual strategy on the performance metrics, the Tukey Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) was used for ANOVA, and the Dunn post-hoc test for Kruskal-Wallis. No significant difference in task completion times was found between style transfer and BC, whereas the former outperformed all other methods. Style transfer had the largest effect relative to GAN (\\u22121.00-1.00 s) and the smallest relative to the Expert (\\u22120.329-0.329 s). For path deviation, style transfer significantly differed from the Expert (\\u22121.50-1.50 mm, p=0.000196p=0.000196) and GAN (0.4510.451 mm, p=0.005074p=0.005074) strategies, however, results were inconclusive for BC (p=0.560p=0.560) and CVAE (p=0.109p=0.109). Style transfer was further found to significantly outperform the Expert and BC strategies in minimising average force (\\u22121.273-1.273 N, p=0.0001p=0.0001; \\u22120.651-0.651 N, p=0.0352p=0.0352), however, no significant difference was found between style transfer and the CVAE and GAN strategies (p=0.867p=0.867, p=0.611p=0.611). The choice of strategy was found to have no conclusive effect on MRV (Kruskal H=2.87H=2.87, p=0.578p=0.578). This result appears surprising in light of the differing action selection apparent for each strategy, particularly in DoC.\\n\\n\\nTo examine the effect of the adaptation methods on the agent actions, the actions taken during each trial were compared with 50 simulated experiments (i.e. source domain) carried out with the source domain expert, and the similarity of action trajectories evaluated by normalised dynamic time warping (DTW) distance. The strategies that adopt actions that are more broadly similar to the source domain expert will score lower on this metric than those that deviate substantially from the expert behaviour. The expert policy itself was included in this comparison since it is being applied to the target domain. We report effect sizes as Hedges\\u2019 gg. Clear differences between the strategies were indicated (Kruskal H=1930H=1930, p=0.0p=0.0), with style transfer yielding large improvements relative to the Expert g=0.875g=0.875 and GAN g=2.18g=2.18, a moderate improvement for CVAE g=0.575g=0.575 and a small reduction in performance relative to BC g=\\u22120.370g=-0.370. Post-hoc testing indicated a high significance level in these effects (p\\u22643.65\\u00d710\\u221217p\\\\leq 3.65\\\\times 10^{-17}) for all comparisons.\\n\\n\\nTo examine the behaviour of each strategy in more detail and enable qualitative comparisons between each strategy, the action trajectories adopted by each policy during an example trial on foam and mica are presented in Figure 8. From Figure 8(a), 8(d), 8(g), 8(j), the action trajectories were broadly similar between BC and style transfer across both materials. Style transfer adopts a more correct behaviour of reducing the feed rate prior to engagement with the material, as compared with BC. Conversely, the GAN policy diverges substantially from the expert behaviour which corroborates the DTW metric results. All adapted policies adopted a more consistent DoC throughout both trials than the unadapted expert policy. Differences between the policy behaviour on each material were mainly evident in the DoC behaviour, transverse stiffness (KxK_{x}) and, to a lesser extent, the normal stiffness (KzK_{z}).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFlat\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2005DoC offset\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2002\\u200aCurved\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) Foam - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) Foam - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(c) Foam - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(d) Foam - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(e) Foam - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(f) Foam - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(g) Mica - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(h) Mica - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(i) Mica - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(j) Mica - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(k) Mica - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(l) Mica - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 8: Comparison of agent actions for foam and mica for planar, DoC offset and curved case studies respectively. Actions include the relative to nominal feed rate adjustment, with 0 corresponding to no change and 1 to double the nominal feed rate, depth of cut (DoC), and controller stiffness in transverse, feed direction and normal directions respectively (Kp,xK_{p,x}, Kp,yK_{p,y}, Kp,zK_{p,z}. Units of KpK_{p} are chosen consistent with (16)).\\n\\n\\n\\nRobustness to path planning offset\\n\\nTo examine the robustness of the method to path planning errors - for example, due to errors in calibration, surface position estimation or noise, we further examine the performance of all strategies with a path planning offset of 1mm, inset into the ground truth material surface. The performance of each strategy was evaluated over 3 trials per strategy, per material.\\n\\n\\nSimilarly to the planar case, strategy significantly impacted task completion times (ANOVA F=17.0F=17.0, p=9.94\\u00d710\\u221210p=9.94\\\\times 10^{-10}); style transfer again differed significantly from all strategies except BC (Tukey HSD p=0.0694p=0.0694), and improvements over other strategies being similar to the planar case study, albeit more consistent across strategies (effect size range \\u22120.658-0.658-\\u22120.850-0.850 s). Whereas path deviation was also influenced by strategy (ANOVA F=4.61F=4.61, p=0.00235p=0.00235), post-hoc testing indicated only GAN differed significantly from the BC (p=0.0047p=0.0047) and Expert (p=0.0125p=0.0125) strategies. Although group means were more concentrated than in the planar case, path deviation was notably more consistent across trials for style transfer, CVAE, and GAN, implying these strategies were better able to tolerate the path planning offset and maintain stable path tracking across materials. MRV was again unaffected by strategy (Kruskal-Wallis H=2.61H=2.61, p=0.624p=0.624), and contrasting the planar case study, no significant differences were observed in average tool load (ANOVA F=1.06F=1.06, p=0.382p=0.382). Similarly to the planar case study, there was a clear separation between the strategies in terms of similarity to expert actions (Kruskal H=688H=688, p=9.33\\u00d710\\u2212148p=9.33\\\\times 10^{-148}). Post-hoc testing indicated style transfer was distinct from the comparison methods, with the least significant result being with CVAE (p=0.0314p=0.0314), small negative effects for BC g=\\u22120.321g=-0.321 and CVAE g=\\u22120.151g=-0.151 and positive effects relative to Expert g=0.682g=0.682 and GAN g=1.31g=1.31 strategies.\\n\\n\\nFigure 8(b), 8(e), 8(h), 8(k) shows the agent actions for the offset case study. All strategies exhibited a more sporadic DoC behaviour than the planar case study, with style transfer exhibiting the most consistent DoC behaviour across both materials, and matching more closely to the planar case study behaviour, supporting observations regarding the consistency of the path deviation. All strategies exhibited a more aggressive variation in stiffness relative to the planar case study, indicating a compensatory response to the offset cutting depth.\\n\\n\\n\\nNon-planar surfaces\\n\\nWe further showcase the performance of each strategy when both material and surface geometry are altered to varying degrees of curvature. Consistent with the planar case study, the reference path with respect to the surface was assumed already known; however, we note that numerous path-planning methods have been proposed in the context of milling, including the case where surface geometry is unknown [9]. For this case study, we assume the material is a thin plate under pure bending, with the surface modelled as a section of a truncated oblique cone \\u2013 in other words, an interpolation between two circular arcs. The arc parameters for each endpoint were derived from a 3-point estimation obtained similarly to the planar case study. Curvatures ranged between 2.36 m-1 and 4.04 m-1 across materials. Cardboard was excluded from the set of materials since the maximum curvature generated during preliminary experiments did not meaningfully differ from the previous case studies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) Polyurethane foam\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) Corrugated plastic\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(c) Mica\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(d) Aluminium\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 9: 3D plot of TCP paths adopted by each strategy with respect to the material surface - qualitative defects are shown in the \\u201cexpert\\u201d and \\u201cGAN\\u201d strategies, which exhibit transverse path deviations on the stiffer materials.\\n\\n\\nAs with the prior case studies, strategy had a significant effect on completion time (Kruskal H=38.5H=38.5, p=8.44\\u00d710\\u22128p=8.44\\\\times 10^{-8}) and in post-hoc testing, style transfer outperformed all strategies except BC (p=0.529p=0.529). The effect of style transfer largely reflected the planar case study, with \\u22121.00-1.00 s relative to GAN, and \\u22120.413-0.413 s relative to the Expert. Differences in path deviation were inconclusive compared to the planar case study, (Kruskal H=9.77H=9.77, p=0.0445p=0.0445) with the most significant result from post-hoc testing arising between GAN and style transfer (p=0.0589p=0.0589); however, differences in average force were more pronounced (ANOVA F=7.71F=7.71, p=0.000025p=0.000025), with style transfer significantly outperforming GAN (\\u22121.25-1.25 N, p=0.0001p=0.0001) but not the other strategies. Corroborating the previous case studies, MRV did not significantly differ between strategies (Kruskal H=2.15H=2.15, p=0.708p=0.708). Furthermore, action similarity again revealed clear separation between strategies (Kruskal H=1390H=1390, p=2.64\\u00d710\\u2212300p=2.64\\\\times 10^{-300}), with style transfer exhibiting the largest deviation from GAN (g=2.14g=2.14) and significant differences from all others (BC g=\\u22120.264g=-0.264, CVAE g=0.503g=0.503, Expert g=0.487g=0.487).\\n\\n\\nThe agent actions, as shown in Figure 8(c), 8(f), 8(i), 8(l), show similar behaviours to the offset case study, with differences in DoC behaviour becoming more pronounced, particularly for the expert policy. CycleGAN adopted a highly sporadic action profile in feed rate and stiffness, particularly for the foam trials. A hypothesis for this behaviour is that the curved material presents a more challenging case for the agent and the much lower cutting forces limit information available to the agent to make decisions. Therefore, the actions resemble those at the beginning of the planar trials in which the agent is in free space and has no information about the contact state or tool engagement. Style transfer and BC both exhibited less consistent DoC behaviour than the planar case studies on foam, however, produced smoother action trajectories that were strongly correlated to the engagement state - for example, contact initiation was well-demarcated for both strategies.\\n\\n\\nFigure 9 shows a representative example of the 3D TCP positions adopted by each strategy for a single cutting trial. The TCP trajectories adopted exhibited clear defects for the expert and GAN trials, which were evident across both low and high stiffness materials. On the low stiffness materials, such as in Figure 9(a) these were evident as low-frequency irregularities, resembling a random walk, whereas for the high stiffness materials, this was exhibited as a higher frequency \\u201cwobble\\u201d, which were unrelated to known phenomena such as chattering. These defects were suppressed or entirely absent during the BC, CVAE and style transfer trials, with these methods yielding similar qualitative improvements across all materials.\\n\\n\\n\", \"Discussion\": \"\\nDiscussion\\n\\nFor the cutting task, the proposed method was evaluated based on task completion times, average path deviation, tool load (average force), material removed volume, behavioural similarity to expert action trajectories in source domain, and qualitatively by the action trajectories, ability to maintain consistent cutting conditions (e.g. depth of cut), as well as TCP trajectories. Relative to the comparison methods \\u2013 consisting of the unadapted source domain expert policy (Expert), our previous work (BC), conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) and CycleGAN (generative adversarial network) \\u2013 the proposed method based on style transfer consistently achieved significant reductions in task completion time across all case studies. Compared to BC and CVAE, style transfer showed comparative performance but did not uniformly surpass them across all metrics.\\n\\n\\nThe reduced influence of strategy in the offset path case study is consistent with the constraint imposed by insetting the path into the material, which limits the ability of the agent to regulate the true DoC. It also implies a common limitation of these methods in modelling out-of-distribution task conditions, wherein offsetting the reference path and nominal feed rate introduces concept shift in the optimal actions across domains in addition to covariate shift in the observations. Although path deviation was more consistent across style transfer, CVAE and GAN strategies than for BC and the expert policy, overall improvements were primarily inconclusive. It is plausible that the inconclusive effects may be attributable to the reduced number of samples for the offset case study.\\n\\n\\nQualitatively, the style transfer trained policy demonstrated improved behavioural stability relative to the model-free approaches, with smoother action trajectories and more consistent control of depth-of-cut and stiffness, which was robust to perturbations in surface geometry and cutting path, and corroborated by higher action similarity to the source domain expert relative to all strategies except BC. The irregular path deviations observed in the TCP trajectories were attributable to the largely sporadic action trajectories of the expert policy, and, to a lesser extent, the GAN strategy. For the stiffer materials, deviations in the path are caused by contact instabilities resulting from interaction between the policy stiffness and the environment stiffness. These behaviours were largely absent with the BC, CVAE and style transfer strategies.\\n\\n\\nWe hypothesise that the poorer performance of CycleGAN-based domain adaptation arises from its limited capacity to preserve task-relevant structure in the translated observations, which has been documented in related work [1]. While CycleGAN has been effective in visual domains where semantic content remains invariant under style changes\\u2014e.g. image-to-image translation, its application to time-series control tasks may disrupt temporal dependencies or distort dynamics-critical features, leading to degraded policy performance.\\n\\n\", \"Conclusion\": \"\\nConclusion\\n\\nAn example-based approach for sim-to-real transfer in robotic control was proposed based on the principle of neural style transfer. Empirical results on a robotic cutting task demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable or superior performance to our previous work, conditional variational autoencoders, and CycleGAN-based time series translation across diverse materials and geometric scenarios, while substantially relaxing the assumptions of our previous example-based work. The proposed method is sample-efficient, demonstrated with 148 off-policy real world trajectories versus 32000 for initial policy training, and avoids the need for training domain discriminator, generator or corrective models, a crucial limitation of previously proposed adaptation methods.\\n\\n\\nWe note the limitation that this work does not explicitly address differing cross-domain target (action) distributions or compatibility of generated trajectories with robot kinematic and dynamic constraints. We posit such constraints could be formulated as part of the optimisation process wherein physical feasibility losses are jointly optimised with style and content losses, and represents a possible extension of this work. Additionally, the quality of generated trajectories and pairings is expected to deteriorate with low coverage of real-world examples, weak content-style match similarity, or parasitic matching where a small subset of real trajectories dominate the pairing.\\n\\n\", \"Data availability\": \"\\nData availability\\n\\nThe datasets generated during and/or analysed during the current study are available in the Figshare repository, DOI 10.6084/m9.figshare.28983659.\\n\\n\", \"Funding Declaration\": \"\\nFunding Declaration\\n\\nThis work was supported by the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) project \\u201cResearch and Development of a Highly Automated and Safe Streamlined Process for Increase Lithium-ion Battery Repurposing and Recycling\\u201d (REBELION) under Grant 101104241.\\n\\n\", \"Acknowledgements\": \"\\nAcknowledgements\\n\\nThe authors would further like to acknowledge Abdelaziz Wasfy Shaarawy, Carl Meggs and Christopher Gell respectively for assistance with experimental validation, design of material holder and cutter tool for experiments herein.\\n\\n\", \"Author contributions\": \"\\nAuthor contributions\\n\\nConceptualisation - A.R. and J.H.; data curation - J.H.; formal analysis - J.H.; funding acquisition - A.R. and R.S.; investigation - J.H.; methodology - J.H. and A.R.; project administration - A.R. and R.S.; software - J.H.; resources - J.H., A.R. and R.S.; supervision - A.R. and R.S.; validation - J.H. and A.R.; visualisation - J.H.; writing (original draft) - J.H.; writing (review & editing) - J.H. and A.R. and R.S.\\n\\n\", \"Competing interests\": \"\\nCompeting interests\\n\\nThe authors declare no competing interests.\\n\\n\"}, \"bibliography\": {\"[1]\": \"\\n[1]\\nH.

naturally reason about object functionality, identify the relevant functional element (e.g., a heater knob or thermostat), and interact with it using an appropriate body configuration.\\nHowever, performing such functionally-correct interactions in a novel 3D environment remains challenging for embodied intelligent agents, as it requires a holistic understanding of scene semantics and the human actions that the environment affords\\u00a0[7, 4].\\nIn this work, we investigate to generate realistic and functional interactions between a 3D human body and a novel scene, conditioned on open-vocabulary task descriptions.\\nAn effective solution to this problem benefits a wide range of applications, including embodied AI, robotics, game production, and video generation, among many others.\\n\\n\\nThe synthesis of 3D human-scene interaction (HSI) has been extensively studied, with existing methods broadly falling into two paradigms.\\nData-driven approaches learn generative models from paired 3D interaction data, achieving high visual fidelity and realistic human poses in controlled settings.\\nFor example, COINS\\u00a0[47] models human body poses conditioned on scene geometry and text commands, while TriDi\\u00a0[29] learns a joint distribution over human pose, object geometry, and interaction signals using diffusion models.\\nDespite their effectiveness, such methods rely on large-scale, high-quality paired interaction datasets and typically require explicit interaction specifications (e.g., \\u201csitting on a sofa\\u201d), limiting their ability to generalize to diverse novel scenes.\\nTo alleviate data dependency, recent work has explored zero-shot or training-free pipelines that leverage pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to generate human-scene interactions.\\nRepresentative examples include GenZI\\u00a0[18], which reconstructs 3D human bodies from multi-view image synthesis, and GenHSI\\u00a0[20], which integrates image-based object grounding with 3D body fitting from a single input image.\\nWhile these methods improve flexibility and support open-vocabulary task prompts, they are primarily effective for general human-scene interactions describing physical relations or motions, e.g., \\u201csitting on a sofa\\u201d or \\u201cwalking on a bridge\\u201d.\\n\\n\\nIn contrast, many real-world tasks like \\u201copen the window\\u201d involve interactions at a functional level, where a human must identify and interact with fine-grained functional elements in the 3D scene to complete the task, such as finding and contacting a window handle to open a window, as shown in Fig.\\u00a01.\\nWe refer to this setting as functional human-scene interaction.\\nThis problem poses fundamental challenges, as it requires reasoning about both the semantics of functional elements in 3D scenes and the 3D human poses needed to establish appropriate contacts.\\nExisting methods typically lack explicit reasoning about object functionality and the corresponding human-scene contact, leading to interactions that are either geometrically implausible or functionally incorrect.\\n\\n\\nIn this work, we propose FunHSI, a training-free, functionality-driven\\nframework that enables functional human-scene interactions from\\nopen-vocabulary task prompts.\\nGiven a set of posed RGB-D images and a task prompt, FunHSI reasons about the functionality of the 3D scene and synthesizes a 3D human that interacts with the scene in a functionally correct manner to accomplish the specified task.\\nAs illustrated in Fig.\\u00a02, FunHSI is built upon three key components.\\nFirst, we introduce a functionality-aware contact reasoning module to identify task-relevant functional elements in the scene, reconstruct their 3D geometry, and infer high-level interaction patterns via contact graph reasoning.\\nThe resulting contact graph explicitly encodes the contact relationships between the human body and both functional and supporting scene elements, serving as a structured representation that bridges high-level task intent and low-level physical interaction.\\nSecond, we propose a functionality-aware body initialization module that synthesizes a human performing the task in the image and estimates the corresponding initial 3D body and hand poses.\\nTo mitigate hallucinations during human synthesis, we introduce a human inpainting optimization strategy that automatically evaluates and improves the generated human pose configuration.\\nIn addition, since image-based synthesis may produce left-right hand inconsistencies with the inferred contact graph, we further refine the contact graph to align contact specifications with the synthesized human.\\nFinally, a body refinement module places the initialized 3D human into the scene and performs stage-wise optimization to jointly refine body pose and human-scene contacts, ensuring both physical plausibility and functional correctness.\\n\\n\\nWe conduct experiments on the SceneFun3D dataset\\u00a0[4] under both functional and general human-scene interaction settings.\\nExtensive qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our design and the superior performance of our framework compared to existing baselines.\\nIn addition, we show that FunHSI is compatible with recent feed-forward 3D reconstruction methods, such as MapAnything\\u00a0[15], and can generate realistic human-scene interactions in reconstructed city scenes.\\nIn summary, our contributions are as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nWe propose FunHSI, a training-free framework that generates functionally correct human-scene interactions from open-vocabulary task prompts. FunHSI extends beyond general interactions to support functional interaction scenarios across diverse scenes and actions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nWe introduce a robust optimization strategy for inpainting humans and contact graph refinement scheme, providing valuable insights for functional human-scene interactions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that FunHSI achieves strong performance in both functional and general HSI tasks compared to existing baselines.

Mat. Fig.\\u00a011) and are fixed across all experiments.\\nWe then prompt a large language model (LLM), e.g., GPT-4o\\u00a0[25] or Gemini, with the task description, the detected functional elements, the predefined body-part set, and additional structured instructions that encourage task-complete and human-like interactions.\\nThe LLM outputs a contact graph \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G}, which specifies the involved body parts, the functional and supporting scene elements, and their corresponding contact relations (see Fig.\\u00a02).\\nSimilar to functional elements, inferred supporting elements (e.g., the floor) are segmented in each image and lifted to 3D masks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3 Functionality-aware Body Initialization\\n\\nAlthough the inferred contact graph \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G} provides high-level interaction constraints, directly fitting a 3D human body to the scene remains challenging due to the strong sensitivity of optimization-based methods to initialization.\\nTo obtain a reliable initial body configuration, we first synthesize a human performing the task in the image and then estimate the corresponding 3D body and hand poses.\\nSince image-based synthesis may introduce left-right inconsistencies with the inferred contact graph, we update the contact graph to align its laterality with the initialized human body.\\n\\n\\nHuman inpainting with contact-aware reasoning.\\n\\nWe employ a vision-language model (VLM), specifically Gemini\\u00a0[2], to synthesize human pixels in the input image.\\nTo encourage the generated human to perform the specified task and establish appropriate contacts with the scene, we introduce a contact-aware prompting strategy.\\nIn addition to the input image without humans and the task description, the inpainting prompt incorporates the inferred contact graph and the detected object bounding boxes.\\nThese cues explicitly specify task-relevant functional and supporting elements, guiding the model to generate human body parts in spatial proximity to the target objects.\\nHowever, image inpainting models may hallucinate, unintentionally altering scene structures or introducing spurious objects, as illustrated in Fig.\\u00a03.\\nTo mitigate this issue, we adopt an iterative generator-critic scheme inspired by LLM-based optimization\\u00a0[40].\\nA separate Gemini model is used as a critic to compare the inpainted image with the original input and verify that (1) the generated human performs the specified task, (2) contacts with functional elements are plausible, and (3) no irrelevant or non-existent objects are introduced.\\nIf any criterion is violated, the generator is prompted to regenerate the human appearance.\\nThis process is repeated until all criteria are satisfied or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\\nIn practice, we find that 3-4 iterations are sufficient and outperform single-pass image generation.\\n\\n\\nFigure 3: Visualization of the human inpainting optimization process. By automatically evaluating the human inpainting results, the image generation process is optimized to produce more reliable outcomes, thus strongly facilitating the subsequent body optimization step.\\n\\n\\n\\n3D human estimation.\\n\\nGiven the human-inpainted image, we estimate SMPL-X parameters to initialize the 3D human body.\\nSpecifically, we estimate the global translation \\ud835\\udc2b\\\\mathbf{r}, root orientation \\ud835\\udf4b\\\\bm{\\\\varphi}, and body pose \\ud835\\udf3db\\\\bm{\\\\theta}^{b} using CameraHMR\\u00a0[26], and estimate hand pose parameters \\ud835\\udf3dh\\\\bm{\\\\theta}^{h} using WiLoR\\u00a0[30].\\nFor cases where the hands are occluded in the image, \\ud835\\udf3dh\\\\bm{\\\\theta}^{h} is initialized to the default relaxed hand pose of SMPL-X.\\nThe estimated SMPL-X body is then transformed from the camera coordinate system to the world coordinate system using the known camera pose, ensuring that the human body and the scene are represented in a common reference frame.\\nThe resulting SMPL-X parameters provide a task-specific and geometrically plausible initialization, which substantially simplifies the subsequent body refinement stage.\\n\\n\\n\\nContact graph refinement.\\n\\nWe observe that image generation models may fail to consistently capture left-right spatial relations.\\nFor example, as shown in Fig\\u00a09, the synthesized image may depict the left hand contacting a handle, even when the inferred contact graph specifies contact with the right hand.\\nSuch laterality inconsistencies between the initialized body configuration and the contact graph can lead to invalid human-scene interactions during subsequent refinement.\\nTo address this issue, we refine the contact graph by aligning its laterality with the inpainted image.\\nSpecifically, we project the left and right wrist joints of the estimated 3D body onto the 2D image plane and compute their distances to the center

and\\n\\ud835\\udc30left,\\ud835\\udc30right\\\\mathbf{w}_{\\\\text{left}},\\\\mathbf{w}_{\\\\text{right}} are the 3D wrist joints.\\nIf dleft>dright+\\u03b4d_{\\\\text{left}}>d_{\\\\text{right}}+\\\\delta, where \\u03b4\\\\delta is a small tolerance to account for projection noise and pose estimation errors, we apply a symmetric left-right swap to all hand-related nodes in the contact graph \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G} (e.g., palm and finger nodes).\\nOtherwise, the contact graph remains unchanged.\\nThis simple distance-based criterion is effective at resolving left-right ambiguities across different scenes and camera viewpoints.\\nThe refined contact graph is denoted as \\ud835\\udca2\\u2217\\\\mathcal{G}^{*}.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4 Optimization-based Body Refinement\\n\\nTo refine the body pose, global configurations, and the contact, a conventional solution is to jointly optimize all SMPL-X parameters.\\nHowever, we find in our trials that such joint optimization often leads to unrealistic HSI results, such as unnatural facing orientation and penetration to the scene.\\nTherefore, we propose a two-stage coarse-to-fine optimization method to gradually refine the initial body state.\\nThis will not only preserve nuances in the initial body pose, but also improve the body-scene contact, making the 3D human body performing the specified task.\\n\\n\\nOptimization objective.\\n\\nTo penalize body-scene interpenetration, we define a collision loss based on the signed distance field (SDF) of the SMPL-X body.\\nGiven a scene point cloud \\ud835\\udcab={\\ud835\\udc29j}j=1N\\\\mathcal{P}=\\\\{\\\\mathbf{p}_{j}\\\\}_{j=1}^{N}, the collision loss is formulated as\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2112col=\\u2211j=1Nmax\\u2061(0,\\u2212\\u03a8\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc29j;\\u03b2,r,\\u03c6,\\u03b8)),\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{col}}=\\\\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\\\max\\\\bigl(0,\\\\;-\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{p}_{j};\\\\beta,r,\\\\varphi,\\\\theta)\\\\bigr),\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n\\nwhere

current SMPL-X body configuration, computed using VolumetricSMPL\\u00a0[24].\\nThis loss penalizes scene points that lie inside the body volume and evaluates to zero when no interpenetration occurs.\\n\\n\\nTo further enforce task-consistent body-scene contact, we introduce a contact loss guided by the refined contact graph \\ud835\\udca2\\u2217\\\\mathcal{G}^{*}.\\nFor each contact pair

The symbol * denotes that the baselines are their modified versions for fair comparison.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvaluation Metrics.\\n\\nWe evaluate HSI synthesis using 4 complementary metrics, i.e. semantic consistency score (SCS), non-collision score (NCS), non-functional contact distance (N-FCD), and functional contact distance (FCD), respectively.\\nThe semantic consistency score measures the alignment between the synthesized 3D interaction and the input text prompt.\\nWe compute a CLIP score\\u00a0[31] by rendering each synthesized interaction into three views, extracting image-text cosine similarities using CLIP ViT-B/32, and averaging the scores across views.\\nFor non-collision score, we compute a non-collision score based on penetration between the SMPL-X body mesh and the reconstructed scene point cloud, following VolumetricSMPL\\u00a0[24].\\nFor non-functional contact distance, we use the average Chamfer distance between the human body mesh and supporting scene elements (e.g., the floor or chair).\\nThe functional contact distance assesses whether the synthesized interaction has appropriate contact with task-relevant functional elements, e.g., a hand touching a door handle in the task of \\u201copen the door\\u201d.\\nThis metric is computed as the Chamfer distance between the functional element region and the interacting human hands.\\n\\n\\n\\nBaselines.\\n\\nTo our knowledge, no existing method explicitly targets functional human-scene interactions in 3D.\\nWe therefore compare our approach with the most closely related baselines.\\nGenZI\\u00a0[18] synthesizes human appearances in individual views and reconstructs a 3D body via multi-view fitting.\\nFor a fair comparison, we adapt GenZI to operate on the same three posed RGB-D images used in our benchmark.\\nGenHSI\\u00a0[20] proposes a training-free pipeline for generating long human-scene interaction videos by combining keyframe planning, 3D-aware inpainting, and motion animation.\\nWe extend GenHSI with functional element detection, perform human inpainting from randomly sampled views, and apply its original body-fitting strategy to our inputs.\\nDue to these adaptations, the resulting baselines are denoted as GenZI* and GenHSI*, respectively.\\n\\n\\nFigure 4: Qualitative results on SceneFun3D for general human-scene interaction.\\nWe compare GenZI*, GenHSI*, and our FunHSI with non-functional prompts such as sitting, squatting, and walking.\\n\\n\\nFigure 5: Qualitative results on SceneFun3D for functional human-scene interaction.\\nGiven open-vocabulary functional commands (e.g., adjusting temperature, dialing a number, switching a radio station) and posed RGB-D inputs, we compare GenZI*, GenHSI*, and our FunHSI.\\nExisting methods struggle to reason about task intent and often interact with incorrect objects or miss fine-grained functional components.\\nIn contrast, FunHSI accurately identifies task-relevant functional elements and generates physically plausible 3D human poses that establish correct contacts with both large objects and small functional parts (e.g., knobs, dials, cabinet handles), demonstrating robust functional grounding and contact reasoning.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.1 Comparison to Baselines\\n\\nQuantitative Evaluation.\\n\\nTable\\u00a01 summarizes the quantitative comparison between our FunHSI method and the modified baselines.\\nOverall, FunHSI performs competitively in the general HSI setting and substantially outperforms the baselines in functional HSI.\\nFor general HSI, FunHSI achieves comparable semantic consistency (0.2498) while improving physical plausibility.\\nIn particular, it attains the lowest contact distance (0.7481), outperforming GenZI* (0.8496) and GenHSI* (0.7599), together with a slightly higher non-collision score (0.9929), indicating that improved contact quality is not achieved at the cost of increased body-scene penetration.\\nFor functional HSI, FunHSI consistently yields the best results, with the lowest functional contact distance (0.2968) and the lowest overall contact distance (0.1837), significantly outperforming GenZI* and GenHSI*.\\nAlthough GenHSI* achieves a marginally higher non-collision score (0.9925 vs. 0.9917), FunHSI maintains comparable physical plausibility and semantic consistency (0.2540).\\n\\n\\nFigure 6: Illustration of functionality awareness of FunHSI.\\nGiven the same 3D scene, FunHSI generates distinct human-scene interactions conditioned on different high-level task prompts.\\n\\n\\nFigure 7: Qualitative results on in-the-wild scenes.\\nWe show our FunHSI results on real-world scenes captured by smart phone in Munich.\\n\\n\\n\\nQualitative Evaluation.\\n\\nFig.\\u00a04 and Fig.\\u00a05 show qualitative comparisons under both general and functional human-scene interaction scenarios.\\nFor functional tasks that require identifying and interacting with task-relevant elements (e.g., operating knobs, opening drawers, or interacting with small appliances), the baseline methods often fail to localize the correct functional targets or produce inaccurate hand-object contacts.\\nIn contrast, FunHSI consistently grounds interactions on the appropriate functional elements and generates realistic human-scene interactions.\\nFor general interaction prompts such as sitting, squatting, or standing near scene objects, FunHSI produces perceptually plausible body poses and interactions, achieving performance comparable to the baseline methods.\\nFig.\\u00a06 further illustrates the functional awareness of FunHSI: given different high-level task prompts abouth the same scene or object, the generated bodies accomplish the intended tasks with diverse and appropriate poses.\\nAdditional visual results are provided in the supplementary material.\\n\\n\\n\\nGeneralization to City Scenes.\\n\\nFig.\\u00a07 presents qualitative results on in-the-wild city scenes captured using a smartphone in public spaces in a city.\\nGiven multi-view RGB images reconstructed into 3D scenes, FunHSI successfully generates plausible human-scene interactions for diverse real-world tasks, such as opening an emergency door, buying a parking ticket, and sitting on a bench.\\nDespite the challenges posed by cluttered environments, noisy geometry, and incomplete reconstructions, our method robustly grounds interactions to the correct functional elements and produces physically plausible body poses.\\nThese results demonstrate that FunHSI generalizes beyond curated indoor datasets and is compatible with real-world feedforward 3D reconstruction pipelines.\\nMore visualizations are provided in Fig.\\u00a012 of the supplementary material.\\n\\n\\nFigure 8: User study of 3D human\\u2013scene interaction synthesis on our curated dataset.

Study\\n\\nWe conduct a perceptual user study to evaluate the visual quality and interaction realism of synthesized 3D human\\u2013scene interactions.\\nThe study is performed on the SceneFun3D benchmark under both functional HSI and general HSI settings.\\nParticipants are presented with rendered interaction results generated by FunHSI and the baseline methods, and are asked to select the most plausible and realistic human\\u2013scene interaction for each task.\\nThe evaluation focuses on overall perceptual quality, including the appropriateness of body pose, physical plausibility of contact, and consistency with the given task prompt.\\nFig.\\u00a08 summarizes the user preference results.\\nOverall, FunHSI is strongly preferred over the baseline methods across all evaluation settings.\\nWhen taking GenHSI as a representative baseline, FunHSI achieves an overall preference rate of 71.1%.\\nWhen evaluated separately, FunHSI obtains a preference rate of 76.8% for functional HSI and 66.0% for general HSI, indicating a clear advantage in scenarios that require functional reasoning and affordance-aware interaction.\\nMoreover, the preference margins are more pronounced in functional HSI, indicating that users are particularly sensitive to correct functional grounding and realistic contact with task-relevant elements.\\nThese results demonstrate that FunHSI not only improves quantitative metrics, but also produces perceptually more convincing human\\u2013scene interactions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMethod\\nNCS \\u2191\\\\uparrow\\nN-FCD \\u2193\\\\downarrow\\nFCD

(green).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3 Ablation Studies\\n\\nContact graph refinement.\\n\\nWe ablate the contact graph refinement module by directly using the initial contact graph predicted by the LLM, without aligning left-right relations to the inpainting image.\\nAs shown in Table\\u00a02 and Fig.\\u00a09, removing this refinement leads to degraded contact accuracy, particularly for supporting elements such as the floor, while only marginally affecting the functional distance.\\nThis behavior indicates that ambiguities in left-right correspondence between the contact graph and the generated image can cause failures in the body fitting stage, highlighting the importance of contact graph refinement for stable and accurate interactions.\\n\\n\\n\\nBody & hand pose estimation.\\n\\nWe evaluate the importance of body and hand pose estimation by removing this module from our pipeline and initializing the SMPL-X body with a T-pose prior to refinement.\\nAs shown in Table\\u00a02 and Fig.\\u00a010, this modification leads to consistent degradation across all metrics.\\nThis observation indicates that accurate body and hand pose estimation from the inpainted image plays a critical role in guiding the optimization.\\n\\n\\nFigure 10: Effect of body and hand pose initialization.\\nBody and hand pose initialization provides a consistent starting point, enabling correct hand placement and stable refinement for functional interactions.\\n\\n\\n\\nBody refinement.\\n\\nWe ablate the body refinement stage by directly using the estimated SMPL-X pose without further optimization.\\nAs shown in Table\\u00a02, this results in increased body-scene penetration and less realistic contacts, indicating that the initial pose alone is insufficient to resolve geometric inconsistencies.\\nThese results confirm the necessity of body refinement for producing physically plausible and functionally correct HSI.\\n\\n\\n\\nFunctional element detection.\\n\\nTo evaluate the impact of detection accuracy, we replace the predicted functional element masks with ground-truth annotations (i.e., oracle detection).\\nAs reported in Table\\u00a02, oracle detection leads to a noticeable reduction in functional contact distance (from 0.2968 to 0.2662) while preserving comparable non-collision performance.\\nThis improvement suggests that our generation framework can directly benefit from more robust upstream detection modules.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"5 Conclusion\": \"\\n\\n5 Conclusion\\n\\nIn this work, we studied the problem of functional human-scene interaction synthesis, where a human must reason about object functionality and establish appropriate physical contact to accomplish an open-vocabulary task in a novel 3D scene.\\nWe proposed FunHSI, a training-free and functionality-driven framework that generates 3D human-scene interactions from posed RGB-D observations and open-vocabulary task prompts, without relying on explicit action-object descriptions.\\nBy integrating functionality-aware contact graph reasoning, human initialization, and optimization-based body refinement, FunHSI bridges high-level task intent and physically plausible interaction.\\nExtensive evaluations on a benchmark derived from SceneFun3D show that FunHSI consistently outperforms existing baselines, particularly for functional interactions, while maintaining strong physical plausibility.\\nWe believe FunHSI represents a step toward more semantically grounded human-scene interaction synthesis and opens up future directions for long-horizon and real-world embodied interaction.\\n\\n\\nLimitations and future work.\\n\\nOur method currently focuses on single-step functional human-scene interactions, where a single human pose is synthesized to accomplish a given task.\\nAs a result, it does not explicitly model long-horizon or multi-step interactions that require sequential planning or temporal reasoning across multiple actions (e.g., opening a door and then walking through it).\\nExtending FunHSI to support temporally coherent, multi-step functional interactions remains an interesting direction for future work.\\nIn addition, the scales of city scenes are estimated from RGB images. Unifying the body and the scene scales is also a future work.\\n\\n\\n\", \"Acknowledgement\": \"\\nAcknowledgement\\n\\nWe sincerely thank Alexandros Delitzas and Francis Engelmann for the guidance on SceneFun3D, Priyanka Patel on the guidance of CameraHMR, Muhammed Kocabas for fruitful discussions on foundation models.\\nWe also sincerely thank Nitin Saini and Nathan Bajandas for kind help and explorations on Unreal Engine.

executable contact reasoning, we annotate the SMPL-X body surface using a hierarchical part decomposition.\\nAt the coarse level, we partition the body surface into 15 semantic parts following the SMPL-X template\\u00a0[27]:\\nhead, left upper arm, right upper arm, left forearm, right forearm,\\nleft hand, right hand, back, buttocks,\\nleft thigh, right thigh, left calf, right calf, left foot, and right foot,\\nas illustrated in Fig.\\u00a011.\\nEach part corresponds to a fixed subset of vertices on the SMPL-X mesh, yielding consistent semantic labeling across different poses and body shapes.\\nSince functional interactions in indoor environments are primarily performed by the hands and often involve small-scale objects (e.g., knobs, switches, dials), we further introduce a fine-grained hand annotation.\\nSpecifically, each hand is subdivided into six sub-parts: one palm and five fingers.\\nEach sub-part is associated with a predefined vertex set on the SMPL-X mesh, as shown in Fig.\\u00a011.\\nThis design allows the representation of both whole-hand contacts (e.g., palm-handle) and finger-level functional interactions (e.g., index finger-button) without introducing unnecessary anatomical complexity.\\nThis hierarchical annotation plays a dual role in our pipeline.\\nFirst, it provides a structured and semantically grounded vocabulary for LLM-based contact graph reasoning, enabling the model to express contacts using interpretable body-part names (e.g., \\u201cleft index finger touches the switch\\u201d).\\nSecond, it establishes a direct mapping from contact semantics to geometric constraints: each contact node bb in the contact graph is mapped to its corresponding vertex set \\ud835\\udcb1b\\\\mathcal{V}_{b}, which is used to compute contact losses during body refinement.\\nBy grounding language-level contact reasoning in mesh-level geometry, this annotation enables precise functional interactions while maintaining physical

approach for human-scene interaction (HSI) synthesis under fair and controlled settings, we construct a new benchmark derived from the SceneFun3D dataset.\\nWe select 30 indoor scenes covering diverse spatial layouts and functional contexts, including living rooms, bedrooms, kitchens, and bathrooms.\\nAll scenes contain common household objects that afford human interaction, such as doors, drawers, cabinets, switches, radiators, and supporting furniture.\\nFor each scene, we provide three canonical RGB-D views captured from different viewpoints, where each view consists of an RGB image, a depth image, and pixel-level mask annotations for key affordance-bearing elements (e.g., door handles, knobs, floors, and supporting surfaces).\\nUsing known camera parameters, the three views are back-projected and fused into a unified 3D point cloud, which serves as the geometric input for all interaction synthesis methods.\\nFor each scene, we manually define two types of interaction settings: functional human-scene interaction (functional HSI) and non-functional human-scene interaction (general HSI).\\nFunctional HSI requires the human to interact with a specific functional element to accomplish a task objective (e.g., open the door, adjust the room temperature, dial a number on the telephone), while non-functional HSI involves generic body-scene interactions that do not rely on object functionality (e.g., sit on the floor, stand in front of the window).\\nEach interaction setting is paired with a single text prompt per scene, resulting in a total of 60 curated interaction tasks (30 functional and 30 non-functional).\\nThe functional interaction prompts are designed to cover a diverse range of manipulation affordances, including pinch_pull, hook_pull, tip_push, rotate, plug_in, unplug, and key_press.\\nMost tasks involve fine-grained hand-object interactions, intentionally emphasizing functional reasoning and precise contact modeling rather than coarse body placement alone.\\nAll methods are evaluated on the same set of scenes, views, and text prompts without additional training or scene-specific tuning.\\nThe reconstructed scene geometry and affordance annotations are reused across different interaction prompts within each scene to ensure consistent and fair comparison.\\n\\n\\n\\nReal-world city scenes.\\n\\nTo evaluate the generalization ability of FunHSI under open-world conditions, we additionally collect a set of real-world city scenes captured in public environments.\\nAll data are captured using an iPhone 14 Pro Max. For each scene, we take multiple RGB images from different viewpoints. We use GeoCalib\\u00a0[36] to estimate the camera intrinsic parameters and the gravity direction, and use MapAnything\\u00a0[15] to estimate the camera poses, the depth maps, and the 3D scene point cloud.\\n\\n\\nThe collected scenes include diverse outdoor and semi-outdoor environments such as building entrances, staircases, ticket machines, escalators, benches, and public facilities, featuring challenging factors including clutter, reflective surfaces, varying illumination, and unconstrained object layouts.\\nWe apply the same processing pipeline as in indoor scenes without any scene-specific tuning.\\nThis experimental setting allows us to assess whether FunHSI can generalize beyond curated indoor datasets and reliably synthesize function-aware human-scene interactions in real-world, unconstrained environments.\\n\\n\\n\", \"Appendix C Implementation Details\": \"\\n\\nAppendix C Implementation Details\\n\\nAll our experiments are conducted on a single NVIDIA A6000 GPU.\\nFor functionality grounding and contact reasoning, we use Gemini-2.5-Flash for functional element identification, Gemini Robotics-ER-1.5 for bounding box localization, and GPT-4o for contact graph generation.\\nAll vision-language model queries are performed in a zero-shot manner, without task-specific fine-tuning.\\nScene reconstruction is performed by back-projecting three posed RGB-D views into a unified point cloud using known camera parameters.\\nFunctional and supporting elements are segmented using SAM-ViT-H and lifted into 3D.\\nThe reconstructed scene geometry and functional element annotations are cached and reused across different interaction prompts within the same scene.\\nHuman body initialization is obtained via image-space human inpainting using Gemini.\\nTo reduce hallucinations, we apply a generator-evaluator loop with at most four iterations.\\nInitial 3D human parameters are estimated using CameraHMR\\u00a0[26] for body pose and WiLoR\\u00a0[30] for hand pose.\\nFor occluded hands, we initialize the hand pose using the relaxed SMPL-X default configuration.\\nBody refinement is performed using the two-stage optimization procedure described in Algorithm\\u00a01.\\nWe use the AdamW optimizer for both stages.\\nIn Stage\\u00a01, we optimize the 3D translation, gravity-axis global rotation, and arm pose parameters for K1=400K_{1}=400 iterations with learning rate \\u03b71=1\\u00d710\\u22122\\\\eta_{1}=1\\\\times 10^{-2}.\\nIn Stage\\u00a02, we optimize the full body pose and translation for K2=200K_{2}=200 iterations using a reduced learning rate \\u03b72=\\u03b71/5\\\\eta_{2}=\\\\eta_{1}/5, together with the VPoser prior.\\nUnless otherwise specified, all hyperparameters are fixed across scenes and prompts.\\n\\n\", \"Appendix D More Experimental Analysis\": \"\\n\\nAppendix D More Experimental Analysis\\n\\nAdditional results on real-world cenes.\\n\\nFig.\\u00a012 presents additional qualitative results of our FunHSI on real-world scenes captured in public environments.\\nThese scenes exhibit significantly higher visual and geometric complexity than indoor datasets, including cluttered backgrounds, irregular lighting conditions, reflective surfaces, and diverse object appearances.\\nGiven three posed RGB-D views and a task-level text prompt, FunHSI successfully synthesizes functionally appropriate human-scene interactions without scene-specific tuning.\\nAs shown in the figure, our method correctly identifies task-relevant functional elements and generates plausible interactions for a wide range of actions, such as taking escalators or elevators, buying tickets from vending machines, opening doors, pinning objects to a whiteboard, and interacting with urban furniture.\\nThese results demonstrate that FunHSI generalizes beyond curated indoor datasets and is capable of handling open-world scenes while preserving functional grounding, contact correctness, and physical plausibility.\\n\\n\\n\\nGeneration Diversity.\\n\\nFig.\\u00a013 illustrates the diversity of human-scene interactions generated by FunHSI under the same scene and task prompt.\\nFor each example, we visualize multiple valid 3D human poses that differ in body configuration, viewpoint, and spatial arrangement, while consistently preserving the intended functional contact.\\nSpecifically, FunHSI produces diverse interaction realizations for tasks such as opening a drawer, dialing a telephone, and opening a door, all of which maintain correct contact with the task-relevant functional elements.\\nThese variations arise from differences in initial image synthesis and subsequent geometric refinement, rather than changes in task specification.\\nThis result demonstrates that FunHSI does not collapse to a single canonical pose, but instead supports diverse yet functionally consistent human-scene interaction generation.\\n\\n\\n\\nHuman Inpainting Examples.\\n\\nFig.\\u00a03 presents representative examples of task-conditioned human inpainting in our pipeline.\\nGiven an input RGB image and a task-level functional prompt, the inpainting model synthesizes a human that is spatially consistent with the scene layout and roughly aligned with the intended interaction region.\\nImportantly, the inpainted humans already reflect coarse functional intent (e.g., reaching, crouching, or bending), providing a semantically meaningful and visually grounded initialization that reduces ambiguity in subsequent 3D reconstruction.\\n\\n\\n\\nBody and Hand Pose Estimation Examples.\\n\\nBased on the inpainted images in Fig.\\u00a03, we estimate the initial 3D SMPL-X body pose together with articulated hand poses.\\nThe estimated poses capture coarse body configuration and hand-object alignment in image space, including which hand is used and its approximate contact location.\\nThese estimates serve as strong initialization for our geometry-aware body refinement, significantly improving optimization stability, accelerating convergence, and reducing failure cases such as incorrect hand assignment or implausible body configurations.\\n\\n\\nFigure 15: \\nLayout of the perceptual study. Below the instructions, participants are presented with a target task label and three images: the original empty scene in the middle, and two candidate images on the sides depicting rendered human-scene interactions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"Appendix E User Study Details\": \"\\n\\nAppendix E User Study Details\\n\\nWe conduct a perceptual study on the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform over results rendered in 30 different scenes, evaluating a functional and a non-functional interaction prompt for each scene.\\nDuring the study, we present users with paired results\\u2014one from our method and one from a baseline. Users choose the result they prefer according to our criteria, and we report the percentage of cases in which the baseline is preferred over our method.\\nThe layout of the perceptual study is shown in Fig.\\u00a015.\\n\\n\\nWe take several precautions in our study design to ensure reliable results. We only allow participants that are experienced (\\u22655000\\\\geq 5000 accepted submissions) and highly rated (\\u226598%\\\\geq 98\\\\% acceptance rate).\\nEach assignment contains 36 comparisons, i.e. pairs of images. The first three are intended as warm-up tasks, and the answers to these are discarded during evaluation. There are three so-called catch trials scattered among the remainder of the assignment. These are intentionally very obvious comparisons that help us identify participants who are providing random inputs. We discard all submissions where even a single one of the three catch trials is failed: 25 out of a total of 120 completions. To further reduce bias, the order of the comparisons is shuffled within an assignment, and the two sides of each comparison are randomly swapped too.\\n\\n\"}, \"bibliography\": {\"[1]\": \"\\n[1]\\nB.

Recent systems  (lu2024aiscientist; yamada2025aiscientistv2; gottweis_towards_2025) demonstrate that LLM-based agents can autonomously execute an end-to-end research loop, including literature review, code generation, experiment execution, and manuscript drafting. These results suggest that automated scientific discovery is becoming practically feasible and that LLM-based agents are approaching a level of functional completeness required for autonomous research (jin_agentreview_2024; sahu_reviewertoo_2025; ajith2024litsearch; zhang_noveltybench_2025; zhang2026opennovelty).\\n\\n\\nDespite this progress, existing systems remain constrained by a fundamental inefficiency in their execution paradigm, which limits their scalability and robustness in practice. In particular, most current research agents (wang_openhands_2025; yang_swe-agent_2024; mitchener_kosmos_2025; luo2025llm4sr) rely on an on-the-spot computation strategy, where nearly all information acquisition, reasoning, and synthesis are performed online at runtime. Under this paradigm, each new research attempt requires the agent to dynamically retrieve large volumes of scientific literature, read and summarize long and heterogeneous documents in real time, and explore a broad space of candidate methods and experimental designs through open-ended generation and trial-and-error. As a result, the cost of producing a single effective scientific discovery remains substantial. For example, a complete execution of the overall pipeline often requires several hours and, in some cases, up to 15 hours to progress from ideation to experimentation (lu2024aiscientist). Similarly, in (schmidgall_agent_2025), literature review and experimental planning alone account for a significant portion of total inference time and place heavy demands on the language model\\u2019s ability to maintain coherent reasoning over long contexts. More importantly, this runtime-centric design repeatedly forces the model to re-process large volumes of unstructured and partially redundant information, even when much of the underlying scientific knowledge is already well established, thereby increasing computational overhead and exacerbating the risk of hallucination and reasoning errors (wang2025repomaster; shin_mind_2025).\\n\\n\\nTo address the efficiency and reliability limitations of existing autonomous research agents, we propose Idea2Story, a scientific discovery framework that explicitly separates offline knowledge construction from online research generation, with the goal of reducing repeated reasoning over scientific literature and alleviating the context window bottleneck of large language models. Most current systems rely on runtime-centric execution, where agents repeatedly retrieve, read, summarize, and reason over large collections of highly overlapping papers for each new research attempt, resulting in substantial computational cost and prolonged execution time. Idea2Story mitigates this inefficiency by shifting literature understanding from online reasoning to an offline stage. In the offline phase, the system periodically collects recently accepted, peer-reviewed papers together with their full review feedback, extracts core methodological units and research patterns, and organizes these units and their observed composition relations into a continuously updated structured knowledge graph. This knowledge graph serves as a compact and reusable representation of established scientific methods and their empirical compatibility, replacing repeated processing of raw documents at runtime. Building on this offline knowledge infrastructure, Idea2Story performs online research generation by aligning underspecified user research intents with existing research paradigms encoded in the knowledge graph. Rather than relying on open-ended generation and trial-and-error, the system retrieves high-quality research patterns as structured compositions of method units, which act as stable methodological blueprints for downstream experimental design and execution. Guided by these validated research patterns, Idea2Story conducts feasibility-driven experimentation and ultimately generates a complete, submission-ready paper in an end-to-end manner.\\n\\n\\nFigure 1:  Overview of the two-stage framework in Idea2Story. The offline stage constructs a structured knowledge graph by extracting and organizing reusable method units from a curated paper corpus. The online stage retrieves and composes research patterns from the knowledge graph to ground underspecified user intent into concrete and coherent research directions.\\n\\n\\nOur work makes the following contributions to autonomous scientific discovery :\\n(1) We introduce Idea2Story, a framework that formalizes autonomous research as a\\npre-computation\\u2013driven process, where scientific knowledge is extracted, structured, and\\nmaintained in a continuously updated methodological knowledge graph, addressing the inefficiency and\\nunreliability of runtime-centric research agents. (2) We propose a knowledge-grounded planning and execution pipeline that alleviates the context window bottleneck and reduces repeated runtime reasoning over literature by converting paper reading into retrieval over a pre-built knowledge graph. (3) We conduct preliminary empirical studies and comparative evaluations, demonstrating that Idea2Story can produce several high-quality research demos and establishing the practical feasibility of the proposed paradigm in an end-to-end setting.\\n\\n\", \"2 Related Work\": \"\\n\\n2 Related Work\\n\\n\\n2.1 Autonomous Scientific Discovery\\n\\nRecent advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven growing interest in autonomous scientific\\ndiscovery agents that aim to automate the full research lifecycle, from code generation to experimental\\nexecution  (hu_controlled_2026; zhang2025evolving; lin_se-agent_2025). Early systems such as The AI Scientist (v1) (lu2024aiscientist) demonstrate the\\nviability of end-to-end automation but rely heavily on manually crafted code templates and largely\\nlinear exploration workflows, which restrict discovery depth and adaptability. Later approaches, including\\nThe AI Scientist-v2 (yamada2025aiscientistv2) and Kosmos (mitchener_kosmos_2025), reduce reliance on\\nexplicit template through the incorporation of agentic tree search and experiment management agents, enabling iterative and multi-round exploration.\\n\\n\\nIn research ideation, LLM-generated ideas are often perceived as highly novel during initial screening; however, prior studies (si2024can) uncover a critical paradox whereby such ideas tend to underperform after implementation relative to human-generated ideas, indicating limited feasibility and practical\\nutility. As more ideas are generated, LLM outputs exhibit growing similarity, leading to diminished meaningful diversity. Similar limitations have also been observed in research evaluation and peer\\nreview (liang2024can; xu2025can; thakkar_can_2025; zhang2026opennovelty). Existing AI-based reviewers display systematic blind\\nspots: shin_mind_2025 shows that LLM reviewers place disproportionate\\nemphasis on technical correctness while undervaluing novelty, deviating from human\\nexpert judgment, while sahu_reviewertoo_2025 demonstrates that AI reviewers\\nstruggle to distinguish fine-grained acceptance categories and are susceptible to sycophancy, with\\nreview scores increasing unreasonably after exposure to author rebuttals. Although recent approaches\\nsuch as AgentReview (jin_agentreview_2024) seek to mitigate these deficiencies by simulating\\ndiverse reviewer roles, automated evaluation systems remain less reliable than human experts in\\nidentifying robust accept/reject decision boundaries.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2.2 LLM-Driven Agents\\n\\nLLM-driven agents still struggle to interact effectively with complex real-world environments.\\nDespite their strong generative capabilities, many existing systems\\u2014such as OpenHands (wang_openhands_2025)\\nand SWE-Agent (yang_swe-agent_2024)\\u2014exhibit limited performance when applied to realistic\\ncodebases. These limitations largely stem from insufficient reasoning over hierarchical dependencies\\nand structural constraints, as well as the inherent restrictions imposed by finite context windows.\\nAs a result, LLM-driven agents achieve relatively low task completion rates on challenging benchmarks\\nsuch as MLE-bench (chan_mlebench_2024) and SciCode (tian_scicode_2024).\\nRepoMaster (wang2025repomaster) further identifies inadequate modeling of codebase structure,\\nincluding function call graphs and module dependency graphs, as a key bottleneck for LLM-driven agents\\noperating in large and complex environments.\\n\\n\\nBeyond execution limitations, LLM-driven agents also exhibit notable deficiencies in scientific rigor\\nand evaluative judgment. When tasked with autonomous assessment, these agents are prone to hallucination and overconfidence. For instance, Agent Laboratory (schmidgall_agent_2025) reports that automated evaluations produced by LLM-driven agents substantially overestimate paper quality compared to human reviewers. Evaluations of Kosmos (mitchener_kosmos_2025) further reveal a tendency to invent opaque quantitative metrics and to conflate statistical significance with scientific value, leading to weak interpretability of experimental conclusions. Moreover, long-horizon autonomous execution exacerbates these issues by introducing behavioral\\ndrift (arike2025tech), where LLM-driven agents gradually deviate from intended research trajectories or generate overly strong and insufficiently justified claims (lu2024aiscientist; schmidgall2025agent; baek_researchagent_2025; hong_metagpt_2023; wu_autogen_2023; lin_se-agent_2025; hu_controlled_2026). This drift further undermines reliability and highlights the\\nneed for stronger structural grounding and validation mechanisms in LLM-based autonomous research\\nsystems.\\n\\n\\n\", \"3 General Idea Generation\": \"\\n\\n3 General Idea Generation\\n\\nIdea2Story is designed to interact with users through high-level and often informal research ideas\\nthat reflect human intuition rather than fully specified technical plans.

Instead of performing document-level reasoning at runtime, Idea2Story\\npre-computes a structured representation of prior work that captures both methodological\\nabstractions and their observed compatibility in accepted research. This stage consists of three\\nmain components: (i) constructing a curated paper pool from peer-reviewed venues, (ii) extracting\\ncore method units that represent reusable methodological contributions, and (iii) organizing these\\nunits and their composition relations into a structured knowledge graph. Together, these components\\nform a persistent methodological memory that decouples literature understanding from downstream\\nidea grounding and research generation.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1.1 Paper Pool Construction\\n\\nWe construct a paper pool from accepted machine learning papers and their associated peer reviews\\ncollected from top-tier conferences. Let \\ud835\\udc9e={NeurIPS,ICLR}\\\\mathcal{C}=\\\\{\\\\text{NeurIPS},\\\\text{ICLR}\\\\} denote the\\nset of venues considered, and let \\ud835\\udcaf\\\\mathcal{T} denote the most recent three-year time window.\\nThe resulting paper pool is defined as\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udcab={p\\u2223p\\u200b\\u00a0is an accepted paper from\\u00a0\\u200bc\\u2208\\ud835\\udc9e\\u200b\\u00a0during\\u00a0\\u200b\\ud835\\udcaf},\\\\mathcal{P}=\\\\{\\\\,p\\\\mid p\\\\text{ is an accepted paper from }c\\\\in\\\\mathcal{C}\\\\text{ during }\\\\mathcal{T}\\\\,\\\\},\\n\\n\\n\\nwhich consists of approximately 5,000 papers from NeurIPS and 8,000 papers from ICLR.

Formally, we model method unit extraction as a mapping\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2130:p~\\u2192\\ud835\\udcb0p={up(1),\\u2026,up(Kp)},\\\\mathcal{E}:\\\\tilde{p}\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathcal{U}_{p}=\\\\{u_{p}^{(1)},\\\\dots,u_{p}^{(K_{p})}\\\\},\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere p~\\u2208\\ud835\\udcab~\\\\tilde{p}\\\\in\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}} denotes a single paper and \\ud835\\udcb0p\\\\mathcal{U}_{p} is a small set\\nof method units that capture its essential technical ideas.\\n\\n\\nAs illustrated in Figure 2, the extraction procedure leverages the standardized structure of\\nacademic papers and analyzes different sections to collect complementary methodological signals.\\nLet \\ud835\\udc31p=(introp,methodp,expp)\\\\mathbf{x}_{p}=(\\\\text{intro}_{p},\\\\text{method}_{p},\\\\text{exp}_{p}) denote the partition of a paper\\ninto its introduction, method, and experiments sections. The introduction is used to identify the\\nhigh-level research motivation and the precise problem formulation, the method section provides\\nsignals about core technical mechanisms such as modeling assumptions, learning objectives, model\\narchitectures, and optimization strategies, and the experiments section reflects how these\\nmechanisms are instantiated and evaluated in practice. By jointly aggregating information from\\nthese sections, the extractor isolates method units that correspond to the primary algorithmic or\\nmodeling contributions of the paper, rather than surface-level experimental details.\\n\\n\\nWe define a method unit u\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb0pu\\\\in\\\\mathcal{U}_{p} as a self-contained description of how a research\\nproblem is formulated or solved, abstracted away from specific implementation choices and\\nexperimental configurations. Elements that primarily involve dataset selection, hyperparameter\\ntuning, or engineering-level optimizations are excluded unless they induce substantive changes to\\nthe problem formulation, model structure, or learning objective. In practice, most papers yield one\\nor a small number of method units. Each extracted unit is further normalized into structured\\nmethodological attributes, including atomic meta-methods, which correspond to indivisible\\nmethodological elements, and composition-level patterns, which describe how multiple method\\nunits are combined within a single paper.\\n\\n\\nAfter extracting method units for all papers, we represent each paper p\\u2208\\ud835\\udcab~p\\\\in\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}}\\nby a vector embedding derived from its associated method units. Formally, let\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc33p=g\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb0p),\\\\mathbf{z}_{p}=g(\\\\mathcal{U}_{p}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udcb0p\\\\mathcal{U}_{p} denotes the set of extracted method units for paper pp and\\ng\\u200b(\\u22c5)g(\\\\cdot) is an embedding function that maps a set of method units to a fixed-dimensional\\nrepresentation.\\n\\n\\nTo induce higher-level research patterns, we first apply a nonlinear dimensionality reduction\\noperator\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc32p=UMAP\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc33p),\\\\mathbf{y}_{p}=\\\\mathrm{UMAP}(\\\\mathbf{z}_{p}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhich projects the high-dimensional embeddings into a lower-dimensional space while preserving\\nlocal semantic neighborhoods. We then perform density-based clustering on the reduced\\nrepresentations using DBSCAN, yielding a partition\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9e={C1,\\u2026,CM},\\\\mathcal{C}=\\\\{C_{1},\\\\dots,C_{M}\\\\},\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere each cluster Cm\\u2282\\ud835\\udcab~C_{m}\\\\subset\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}} corresponds to a coherent research pattern.\\n\\n\\nThese induced clusters serve as higher-level abstractions over individual papers, capturing\\nrecurring methodological structures that are reused across the literature. The resulting research\\npatterns form the basis for subsequent retrieval and composition.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2:  Offline knowledge graph construction in Idea2Story. Academic papers and their associated review artifacts are first anonymized and safety-filtered, then deconstructed into layered methodological representations. These layers capture complementary aspects of a paper, including its core research idea, domain context, high-level story skeleton, and packaging actions. The extracted elements are normalized into atomic method units and meta-methods, which are connected through composition and similarity relations. Reviewer feedback is incorporated as additional signals to refine relations and validate abstractions. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1.3 Knowledge Graph Construction\\n\\nBuilding on the extracted method units, we organize reusable methodological components into a\\nstructured knowledge graph that supports systematic method discovery and composition. While\\nindividual method units capture isolated algorithmic or modeling ideas, effective research methods\\nin practice typically arise from structured combinations of multiple method units. The knowledge\\ngraph provides a unified representation that explicitly encodes canonicalized method units,\\nmeta-methods, and their empirically observed composition relations in prior work.\\n\\n\\nFormally, we define the knowledge graph as a directed graph\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udca2=(\\ud835\\udcb1,\\u2130),\\\\mathcal{G}=(\\\\mathcal{V},\\\\mathcal{E}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere each node v\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb1v\\\\in\\\\mathcal{V} corresponds to a canonicalized method unit or a meta-method.\\nCanonicalization groups semantically similar method units across the corpus into shared\\nmeta-method abstractions, reducing surface-level variation while preserving core methodological\\nintent. As a result, nodes in the graph represent atomic or minimally indivisible methodological\\nelements that are reused across papers.\\n\\n\\nEdges in the graph encode composition relations between method units. For a given paper\\np\\u2208\\ud835\\udcab~p\\\\in\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}} with extracted method unit set \\ud835\\udcb0p\\\\mathcal{U}_{p}, we add directed edges\\nbetween pairs of method units (ui,uj)\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb0p\\u00d7\\ud835\\udcb0p(u_{i},u_{j})\\\\in\\\\mathcal{U}_{p}\\\\times\\\\mathcal{U}_{p} to indicate that\\nthey are jointly instantiated as part of the same methodological pipeline. These edges capture\\nempirical evidence of method compatibility observed in prior work, reflecting how different\\nmethod units are combined in practice rather than hypothetical or manually specified relations.\\n\\n\\nAggregating composition relations across the full corpus yields a graph structure that encodes both\\nmethodological abstraction and empirical compatibility. In particular, the graph captures two\\ncomplementary levels of structure: (i) reusable methodological elements represented as\\ncanonicalized method units and meta-methods, and (ii) composition constraints induced from\\nco-occurrence statistics in accepted papers. This separation allows Idea2Story to reason about\\nmethods at a higher level of abstraction than individual papers, while remaining grounded in\\nobserved research practice.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2 Online Research Generation.\\n\\nGiven a target research objective, Idea2Story treats method discovery as a graph-based retrieval and\\ncomposition problem over \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G}. The system retrieves relevant subgraphs and composes\\ncompatible method units by following connectivity constraints in the graph, producing candidate\\nresearch patterns that correspond to structured combinations of method units. These research\\npatterns serve as high-level methodological blueprints that bridge abstract research intent and\\nconcrete experimental design, enabling downstream planning, feasibility analysis, and end-to-end\\npaper generation.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2.1 Research Pattern Retrieval\\n\\nGiven a user-provided research idea expressed in natural language, we formulate research pattern\\nidentification as a structured retrieval problem over the knowledge graph \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G}. Let\\nqq denote the input research idea, and let \\ud835\\udc9e={C1,\\u2026,CM}\\\\mathcal{C}=\\\\{C_{1},\\\\dots,C_{M}\\\\} denote the set of\\nresearch patterns induced from the paper corpus. The goal is to rank patterns in \\ud835\\udc9e\\\\mathcal{C}\\naccording to their relevance to qq.\\n\\n\\nRather than relying on a single similarity metric, Idea2Story adopts a multi-view retrieval\\nformulation that aggregates complementary signals from different semantic abstractions. Formally,\\nfor each research pattern CmC_{m}, we compute a relevance score\\n\\n\\n\\ns\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)=\\u2211v\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb1\\u03bbv\\u200bsv\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q),s(C_{m}\\\\mid q)=\\\\sum_{v\\\\in\\\\mathcal{V}}\\\\lambda_{v}\\\\,s_{v}(C_{m}\\\\mid q),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udcb1={idea,domain,paper}\\\\mathcal{V}=\\\\{\\\\text{idea},\\\\text{domain},\\\\text{paper}\\\\} indexes the retrieval views,\\nsv\\u200b(\\u22c5)s_{v}(\\\\cdot) denotes a view-specific scoring function, and \\u03bbv\\\\lambda_{v} are fixed weighting\\ncoefficients that balance the contribution of different views.\\n\\n\\nIdea-level retrieval.\\n\\nAt the idea level, the system retrieves previously observed research ideas that are semantically\\nsimilar to the input query qq. Let \\u2110\\\\mathcal{I} denote the set of stored research ideas extracted\\nfrom the corpus, and let simidea\\u200b(q,i)\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{idea}}(q,i) denote a semantic similarity function\\nbetween qq and an idea i\\u2208\\u2110i\\\\in\\\\mathcal{I}. The idea-level score of a research pattern CmC_{m} is\\ncomputed by aggregating the similarity scores of ideas associated with the pattern:\\n\\n\\n\\nsidea\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)=maxi\\u2208\\u2110\\u200b(Cm)\\u2061simidea\\u200b(q,i),s_{\\\\text{idea}}(C_{m}\\\\mid q)=\\\\max_{i\\\\in\\\\mathcal{I}(C_{m})}\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{idea}}(q,i),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u2110\\u200b(Cm)\\\\mathcal{I}(C_{m}) denotes the set of ideas linked to pattern CmC_{m}.\\n\\n\\n\\nDomain-level retrieval.\\n\\nAt the domain level, the system interprets the input idea qq in terms of its underlying research\\ndomains and methodological themes. Let \\ud835\\udc9f\\\\mathcal{D} denote the set of research domains, and let\\nsimdomain\\u200b(q,d)\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{domain}}(q,d) measure the relevance between qq and domain d\\u2208\\ud835\\udc9fd\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}.\\nThe domain-level score of pattern CmC_{m} is computed as\\n\\n\\n\\nsdomain\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)=\\u2211d\\u2208\\ud835\\udc9f\\u200b(Cm)simdomain\\u200b(q,d)\\u200bw\\u200b(d,Cm),s_{\\\\text{domain}}(C_{m}\\\\mid q)=\\\\sum_{d\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}(C_{m})}\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{domain}}(q,d)\\\\,w(d,C_{m}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udc9f\\u200b(Cm)\\\\mathcal{D}(C_{m}) denotes the domains associated with pattern CmC_{m}, and w\\u200b(d,Cm)w(d,C_{m}) captures\\nempirical effectiveness signals derived from the knowledge graph.\\n\\n\\n\\nPaper-level retrieval.\\n\\nAt the paper level, the system retrieves papers whose technical content is semantically aligned\\nwith the input idea. Let \\ud835\\udcab\\u200b(Cm)\\\\mathcal{P}(C_{m}) denote the set of papers instantiating pattern CmC_{m}.\\nThe paper-level score is computed as\\n\\n\\n\\nspaper\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)=maxp\\u2208\\ud835\\udcab\\u200b(Cm)\\u2061simpaper\\u200b(q,p)\\u22c5\\u03b1\\u200b(p),s_{\\\\text{paper}}(C_{m}\\\\mid q)=\\\\max_{p\\\\in\\\\mathcal{P}(C_{m})}\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{paper}}(q,p)\\\\cdot\\\\alpha(p),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere simpaper\\u200b(q,p)\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{paper}}(q,p) measures semantic similarity between qq and paper pp,\\nand \\u03b1\\u200b(p)\\\\alpha(p) denotes a quality-related weight derived from peer review metadata.\\n\\n\\nThe final ranked list of research patterns is obtained by ordering patterns according to their\\naggregated multi-view relevance scores.

In each iteration, a large language model is prompted to act as a reviewer\\nand evaluate the current research pattern along several predefined criteria, including technical\\nsoundness, novelty with respect to existing literature, and overall clarity of the problem\\u2013method\\nalignment.

Experimental outcomes can then serve as additional signals to refine the instantiated research stories, forming a feedback loop between method design and empirical validation. Beyond experimentation, future work may further explore how refined research patterns can be systematically translated into complete paper drafts, covering method descriptions, experimental results, and discussion sections.

Our qualitative analyses and comparative studies show that this design leads to research patterns with clearer problem reformulation, stronger methodological structure, and higher conceptual novelty than direct LLM generation. These results highlight the importance of explicit pattern modeling as a foundation for scalable and reliable autonomous research.

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [18] and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [9] have achieved high-fidelity rendering, with 3DGS in particular becoming the mainstream choice for its real-time rendering capability. However, both methods require densely captured training images, which are often difficult to obtain, and they tend to produce artifacts at extrapolated viewpoints, namely those outside the interpolation range of the training views. These limitations hinder their use in downstream applications such as autonomous driving simulation and free-viewpoint user experiences.\\n\\n\\nRecent work has explored addressing artifacts in extrapolated view rendering with 3DGS. Existing approaches fall into two categories: adding regularization terms during training or augmenting supervision views using generative models. The regularization terms are often derived from 3D priors [48, 52, 10, 50, 32], or additional sensors [21], but they are typically hand-crafted and limited to specific scene types. Moreover, their lack of hallucination capability further restricts their applicability.\\nIn leveraging diffusion models (DMs), some approaches fine-tune them with paired data, e.g., by using sparse LiDAR inputs or extrapolated renderings with artifacts to generate refined images. Many of these methods train on domain-specific datasets, such as those for autonomous driving [41, 36, 20, 35], which inevitably compromises the generalization ability of DMs. More recently, Difix3D+ [37] fine-tunes SD Turbo [25] on a wider range of 3D datasets, improving generalization. However, the substantial effort required to curate 3D data and the high fine-tuning cost make this approach time-consuming and expensive to extend to other DMs.\\nAn alternative line of work seeks to improve extrapolated rendering without fine-tuning, typically by providing extrapolated renderings as guidance during the denoising step. This preserves the generalization capacity of DMs trained on large-scale data, but such methods still lag behind fine-tuned approaches that are specifically adapted to the task.\\n\\n\\nGiven the generalization\\u2013fidelity trade-off, we ask: can extrapolated view rendering be improved with DMs without sacrificing generalization? To address this challenge, we focus on fine-tuning-free methods and enhance their effectiveness for NVS extrapolation. This is achieved with our proposed 2D\\u20133D interleaved refinement strategy combined with per-pixel confidence guidance for fine-tuning-free image refinement. Specifically, given a trained 3DGS, we sample an extrapolated viewpoint, render the 2D image, refine it with a 2D image diffusion model (IDMs), and integrate the refined image back into the 3D scene by updating the 3DGS before proceeding to the next viewpoint.\\nThis interleaved 2D-3D refinement ensures that previously enhanced views inform subsequent 2D refinements and improve multi-view consistency. Importantly, we introduce a confidence-guided 2D refinement, where a per-pixel confidence map rendered from the 3DGS highlights regions requiring further improvement by the 2D DM. This contrasts with previous training-free methods that rely solely on rendering opacity, leaving the DM to identify artifact regions on its own. While our confidence guidance could in principle be applied to video diffusion models (VDMs), advanced video backbones are typically more computationally expensive and use temporal down-sampling, which prevents the direct use of per-pixel guidance. We show that our 2D\\u20133D interleaved optimization strategy achieves consistent refined images without relying on VDMs.\\n\\n\\nOur contribution can be summarized as follows: 1) We propose a simple yet effective approach for enhancing extrapolated 3DGS rendering without the need for fine-tuning DMs, featuring a 2D\\u20133D interleaved refinement strategy and per-pixel confidence guidance. 2) Our method is compatible with various DMs and preserves generalization across diverse scene contents. 3) Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing fine-tuning-free methods and achieves comparable or even superior performance to training-based methods.\\n\\n\", \"2 Related Work\": \"\\n\\n2 Related Work\\n\\nNumerous works have made efforts on improving quality of NVS. In this section, we will discuss related works in NVS and 3D reconstruction. Furthermore, we will explore efforts that improve NVS quality by incorporating priors from geometry, physics or generative models.\\n\\n\\nNovel View Synthesis: \\nNVS aims to generate photorealistic images of a scene from novel viewpoints. Early methods primarily relied on traditional image-based rendering techniques, such as Light Field Rendering [14], Image-Based Rendering [28], and Multi-Plane Image [55, 30]. These approaches typically interpolate between existing views and are often limited by dense input imagery and struggle with complex occlusions. The advent of deep learning revolutionized NVS, led by two major paradigms: NeRF [18] and 3DGS [9]. NeRF implicitly represents a scene and achieves high-quality results, but its training and rendering speeds are slow. In contrast, 3DGS offers rapid training and real-time rendering. However, a significant limitation of 3DGS is the occurrence of visual artifacts in extrapolated views, which are viewpoints far from the training data. These artifacts compromise the realism and geometric fidelity of the synthesized images. Mitigating these artifacts is the focus of this paper.\\n\\n\\nNVS with Geometry Priors: \\nTo enhance the robustness of NVS models and reduce reconstruction ambiguity, many works have introduced geometry priors. These priors provide key information about the scene\\u2019s 3D structure, which can be explicitly provided by external sensors like LiDAR or depth cameras [21, 41, 36, 23, 40, 17, 8]. Other methods utilize strong structural priors often found in real-world scenes, such as the assumption that the ground is a flat plane [52, 10, 5], the sky can be modeled as a dome [4, 43], or that walls and tables in indoor scenes are predominantly orthogonal [48]. These structural assumptions help regularize the reconstruction process. While these geometry priors can mitigate some reconstruction challenges, they often fall short of completely solving the artifact problem in extrapolated views, especially when the initial geometric prior is itself inaccurate.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: Method. FreeFix improves the rendering quality of extrapolated views in 3DGS without fine-tuning DMs, as illustrated in the bottom left of the pipeline. We propose an interleaved strategy that combines 2D and 3D refinement to utilize image diffusion models for generating multi-frame consistent results, as shown at the top of the pipeline. In the 2D refinement stage, we also introduce confidence guidance and overall guidance to enhance the quality and consistency of the denoising results.\\n\\n\\nNVS with Generative Priors: \\nGenerative priors leverage pre-trained generative models to assist NVS tasks, particularly when dealing with data scarcity or missing information. Early works explored using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to improve rendering quality [39, 24, 26], where the GAN\\u2019s discriminator ensured the local realism of synthesized images. More recently, DMs [33, 22, 13, 31, 42, 11, 12, 34] have gained prominence for their powerful generative capabilities. Their application in NVS falls into two main categories. The first involves fine-tuning a pre-trained DM, which has learned powerful priors from datasets [37, 41, 35, 38, 54, 49, 47]. This process adapts the model\\u2019s knowledge to scene-specific appearances but can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. The second category, which aligns with our proposed method, leverages a pre-trained DM as a zero-shot prior without fine-tuning. The key challenge here is determining what part of the rendered image should be used as guidance for the DM, and how to maintain multi-view consistency. Using the opacity channel of the rendered image as guidance is a common but often crude solution [45, 16, 46], as areas with high opacity can still be artifacts. Additionally, ensuring consistency across different novel views using IDMs is a critical problem. While VDMs [33, 31, 42, 11] can inherently handle this, they are often computationally heavy and not suitable for all applications.\\n\\n\", \"3 Method\": \"\\n\\n3 Method\\n\\nThe FreeFix pipeline is illustrated in Fig.\\u00a02.

VDMs are widely used for improving 3DGS [9] because of the inherent capability to apply attention across frames, ensuring multi-frame consistency. However, the temporal attention mechanism also introduces a computational burden,\\nwhich also limits the output length of VDMs, as the computation complexity is quadratic in relation to the sequence length. Furthermore, recent advanced VDMs [42, 11, 31] utilize 3D VAE as their encoder and decoder, which performs temporal down-sampling, making it challenging to apply per-pixel confidence guidance.\\n\\n\\nDue to the above reasons, we select IDMs as the backbone in FreeFix. However, most existing IDMs are not designed for the novel view synthesis task and do not take reference views as input. IP-Adapter [44] accepts image prompts as input, but it is intended for style prompts rather than novel view synthesis. Directly applying IDMs can lead to inconsistency across frames and finally result in blurriness in refined 3DGS. To tackle the problem, we propose an interleaved refining strategy, multi-level confidence guidance, and overall guidance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3 Interleaved Refinement Strategy\\n\\n2D Refinement: \\nAs mentioned in Sec.\\u00a03.1, the trajectory of extrapolated views \\ud835\\udcafext={\\ud835\\udcb10e,\\ud835\\udcb11e,\\u2026,\\ud835\\udcb1me}\\\\mathcal{T}_{\\\\textit{ext}}=\\\\{\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{0},\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{1},...,\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{m}\\\\} in our task definition is intended to be continuous. This continuous trajectory setting ensures that adjacent views \\ud835\\udcb1ie\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i} and \\ud835\\udcb1i+1e\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i+1} undergo only small transformations. A naive approach to keep consistency would be warping pixels from \\ud835\\udcb1ie\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i} to \\ud835\\udcb1i+1e\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i+1} and using DMs for inpainting. However, both rendered depth and predicted depth are not reliable for warping. Instead, we propose an interleaved refining strategy to enhance multi-view consistency.\\n\\n\\nSpecifically, the refining process is interleaved and incremental along the trajectory \\ud835\\udcaf\\\\mathcal{T}. Given the current view \\ud835\\udcb1ie\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i}, the current 3DGS \\ud835\\udca2i\\u22121\\\\mathcal{G}_{i-1} and rendered image \\u2110^ie=\\u03c0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb1ie;\\ud835\\udca2i\\u22121)\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e}_{i}=\\\\pi(\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i};\\\\mathcal{G}_{i-1}), we utilize denoising with guidance, as discussed in Sec.\\u00a03.4, to obtain the fixed image \\u2110^ie,f\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{i}. We also maintain a fixed image set \\u2131i\\u22121={(\\ud835\\udcb10e,\\u2110^0e,f),(\\ud835\\udcb11e,\\u2110^1e,f),\\u2026,(\\ud835\\udcb1i\\u22121e,\\u2110^i\\u22121e,f)}\\\\mathcal{F}_{i-1}=\\\\{(\\\\mathcal{V}_{0}^{e},\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{0}),(\\\\mathcal{V}_{1}^{e},\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{1}),...,(\\\\mathcal{V}_{i-1}^{e},\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{i-1})\\\\}. We refine the current 3DGS \\ud835\\udca2i\\u22121\\\\mathcal{G}_{i-1} to \\ud835\\udca2i\\\\mathcal{G}_{i} by using the training set \\ud835\\udcaet\\u200br\\u200ba\\u200bi\\u200bn\\\\mathcal{S}_{train}, the previous refined view set \\u2131i\\u22121\\\\mathcal{F}_{i-1} and the current refined image \\u2110^ie,f\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{i}.\\n\\n\\n3D Refinement: \\nThe supervision during 3D Refinement for \\ud835\\udca2i\\\\mathcal{G}_{i} comes from current refined view (\\ud835\\udcb1ie,\\u2110^ie,f)(\\\\mathcal{V}_{i}^{e},\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{i}), \\u2131i\\u22121\\\\mathcal{F}_{i-1} and St\\u200br\\u200ba\\u200bi\\u200bnS_{train}. The detailed sampling strategy for training is illustrated in the supplements.\\n\\n\\nThe generated results do not guarantee 3D consistency with training views, so we employ a smaller training loss for the generated views to prevent inaccurately generated areas from distorting 3D scenes. Additionally, the generated results exhibit slightly color bias compared to training views, which are often difficult for humans to distinguish. However, when applying the interleaved refining strategy, these slight color biases will accumulate, which may lead to a blurry and over-gray effect. We implement a simple yet efficient technique similar to [53] to tackle the problem. For each generated view, we define two optimizable affine matrices \\ud835\\udc9cf\\u2208\\u211d3\\u00d73\\\\mathcal{A}_{f}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{3\\\\times 3} and \\ud835\\udc9cb\\u2208\\u211d3\\u00d71\\\\mathcal{A}_{b}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{3\\\\times 1}. The rendering results used for computing the training loss are applied to these affine matrices to avoid learning color bias:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2110^e\\u2032=\\ud835\\udc9cf\\u00d7\\u2110e^+\\ud835\\udc9cb\\\\displaystyle\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e^{\\\\prime}}=\\\\mathcal{A}_{f}\\\\times\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}^{e}}+\\\\mathcal{A}_{b}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2112=(1\\u2212\\u03bbs)\\u200b\\u2016\\u2110^e\\u2032\\u2212\\u2110^e,f\\u20161+\\u03bbs\\u200bSSIM\\u200b(\\u2110^\\u2032,\\u2110^e,f)\\\\displaystyle\\\\mathcal{L}=(1-\\\\lambda_{s})||\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e^{\\\\prime}}-\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}||_{1}+\\\\lambda_{s}\\\\textit{SSIM}(\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{{}^{\\\\prime}},\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f})\\n\\n(4)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRendered RGB w Artifacts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u03b3c=0.001\\\\gamma_{c}=0.001\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u03b3c=0.01\\\\gamma_{c}=0.01\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u03b3c=0.1\\\\gamma_{c}=0.1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 4: Multi-Level Certainty Masks. FreeFix employs multiple \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} to obtain multi-level certainty masks as guidance. Each level of mask guides a different stage of denoising. A small \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} with high overall certainty is used for the early stages of denoising, while a large \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} which offers greater accuracy, is applied during the later stages of denoising.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4 Denoising with Guidance\\n\\nGiven the rendered results of an extrapolated view, even though the image contains artifacts, most areas can still be regarded as photo-realistic rendering results. These regions with relatively high fidelity can provide essential information for generating an image free of artifacts, while maintaining almost the same content.\\n\\n\\nExperiments in Difix3D+ [37] have demonstrated that adding noise to images with artifacts and directly applying denoising using DMs can effectively remove these artifacts; however, the strength of the added noise is quite sensitive. For regions with significant artifacts, a larger scale of noise is needed to repaint those areas, while a smaller scale of noise is sufficient for areas with minimal artifacts. Although it may seem intuitive to apply different levels of noise to different regions, this approach does not align the data distribution of DMs. Instead, employing guidance during the diffusion denoising step is more practical and has been widely adopted in [16, 45].\\n\\n\\nConfidence Map: \\nUtilizing appropriate guidance is an effective method for generating high-fidelity images while preserving accurate rendering results. However, current approaches that use warp masks or rendering opacities as guidance weights do not account for the presence of artifacts. For example, as illustrated in Fig.\\u00a03 (a), even when severe artifacts are present, the rendering opacities remain high, indicating that these artifacts continue to act as strong guidance during the denoising process.\\nTo tackle this issue, we propose utilizing confidence masks as guidance weights, as shown in Fig.\\u00a03 (c). The confidence scores are derived from Fisher information, which is also referenced in [7, 6]. Specifically, Fisher information measures the amount of information that the observation (x,y)(x,y) carries about the unknown parameters ww that model pf\\u200b(y|x;w)p_{f}(y|x;w). In the context of novel view synthesis, Fisher information can be defined as:\\n\\n\\n\\npf\\u200b(\\u03c0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)|\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)p_{f}(\\\\pi(\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})|\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})\\n\\n(5)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udcb1\\\\mathcal{V} and \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G} represent viewpoint and 3DGS respectively, while \\u03c0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)\\\\pi(\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}) denotes the volume rendering results at the specific view \\ud835\\udcb1\\\\mathcal{V}.\\n\\n\\nThe negative log likelihood of Fisher information in Eq.\\u00a05, which serves as the uncertainty \\ud835\\udc9e\\u00af\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{\\\\bar{C}}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}} of \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G} at view \\ud835\\udcb1\\\\mathcal{V}, can be approximately derived as a Hessian matrix, the detailed derivation can be found in the supplementary materials:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9e\\u00af\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\\\displaystyle\\\\mathcal{\\\\bar{C}}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}\\n=\\u2212log\\u2061pf\\u200b(\\u03c0|\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)\\\\displaystyle=-\\\\log p_{f}(\\\\pi|\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n=\\ud835\\udc07\\u2032\\u2032\\u200b[\\u03c0|\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2]\\\\displaystyle=\\\\mathbf{H}^{{}^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}}[\\\\pi|\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n=\\u2207\\ud835\\udca2\\u03c0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)T\\u200b\\u2207\\ud835\\udca2\\u03c0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)\\\\displaystyle=\\\\nabla_{\\\\mathcal{G}}\\\\pi(\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})^{T}\\\\nabla_{\\\\mathcal{G}}\\\\pi(\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})\\n\\n(6)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[7, 6] renders the attribute \\ud835\\udc9e\\u00af\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{\\\\bar{C}}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}} in volume rendering to obtain the uncertainty map. However, uncertainty is not a numerically stable representation, as its value can range from [0,+\\u221e)[0,+\\\\infty). As illustrated in Fig.\\u00a03 (b), the numeric instability of uncertainty may render an inaccurate uncertainty map. This often occurs when there are Gaussians with low opacity and high uncertainty, which can overwhelm the volume rendering. Instead, we use the complementary value as guidance, certainty \\ud835\\udc9e\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}, also referred to as confidence in this paper, which has a stable numeric range of [0,1][0,1].\\nThe certainty \\ud835\\udc9e\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\u03b3c\\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}^{\\\\gamma_{c}} is defined as:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9e\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\u03b3c=exp\\u2061[\\u2212\\u03b3c\\u200b\\ud835\\udc9e\\u00af\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2]\\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}^{\\\\gamma_{c}}=\\\\exp[-\\\\gamma_{c}\\\\mathcal{\\\\bar{C}}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}]\\n\\n(7)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} is a hyperparameter.

The larger the value of \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c}, the more sensitive the rendered confidence map becomes to artifacts. Selecting a single appropriate \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} is not trivial. Therefore, we apply multi-level confidence maps as guidance. Since DMs generate a coarse structure of image rather than detailed appearance in the early denoising stages [27], we provide \\u2133\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\u03b3c\\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}^{\\\\gamma_{c}} with a small \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} to offer more comprehensive guidance. In the later denoising stages, DMs tend to generate detailed appearances, so we provide \\u2133\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\u03b3c\\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}^{\\\\gamma_{c}} with a large \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} to ensure that the guidance is sufficiently accurate.\\n\\n\\nConfidence Guidance: \\nGiven the rendered image I^\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\\\hat{I}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}} and the corresponding confidence map \\u2133\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\u03b3c\\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}^{\\\\gamma_{c}}, we can provide denoising guidance to DMs.\\nWe denote the rendered image after VAE encoding as x0rx_{0}^{r}, and the resized confidence map that aligns with the shape of the latent space as \\u2133c\\\\mathcal{M}^{c}. As illustrated in Eq.\\u00a02, the predicted x0tx_{0}^{t} at tt timestep is given by xt\\u2212\\u03c3t\\u200b\\ud835\\udd3d\\u03b8\\u200b(xt,t)x_{t}-\\\\sigma_{t}\\\\mathbb{F}_{\\\\theta}(x_{t},t).

Instead, we derive the new xt\\u22121x_{t-1} by solving the following equations:\\n\\n\\n\\nxt\\u22121\\\\displaystyle x_{t-1}\\n=x0+\\u03c3t\\u22121\\u200b\\ud835\\udd3d\\u03b8\\u200b(xt,t)\\\\displaystyle=x_{0}+\\\\sigma_{t-1}\\\\mathbb{F}_{\\\\theta}(x_{t},t)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nxt\\u22121\\\\displaystyle x_{t-1}\\n=xt+(\\u03c3t\\u22121\\u2212\\u03c3t)\\u200b\\ud835\\udd3d\\u03b8\\u200b(xt,t)\\\\displaystyle=x_{t}+(\\\\sigma_{t-1}-\\\\sigma_{t})\\\\mathbb{F}_{\\\\theta}(x_{t},t)\\n\\n(10)\\n\\n\\nThe representation of xt\\u22121x_{t-1} derived from x0t,gx_{0}^{t,g} and xtx_{t} is:\\n\\n\\n\\nxt\\u22121=\\u03c3t\\u22121\\u03c3t\\u200bxt\\u2212\\u03c3t\\u22121\\u2212\\u03c3t\\u03c3t\\u200bx0t,gx_{t-1}=\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{t-1}}{\\\\sigma_{t}}x_{t}-\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{t-1}-\\\\sigma_{t}}{\\\\sigma_{t}}x_{0}^{t,g}\\n\\n(11)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOverall Guidance: \\nAlthough the interleaved refining strategy provides higher fidelity rendering results and ensures that the rendering is more consistent with the generated content, using IDMs may still encounter issues of inconsistency in areas with low confidence. Particularly in regions with weak textures like ground and sky, the confidence map tends to be low, and allowing denoising to proceed freely in these areas can result in high inconsistency and blurriness in 3DGS. To address this issue, we propose an overall guidance approach, which combines confidence guidance in the very early stages of denoising to provide structural hints for the images.\\nThe combination of certainty and overall guidance is defined as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\nx0t,g=\\\\displaystyle x_{0}^{t,g}=\\n\\u2133c\\u2299x0r+\\\\displaystyle\\\\mathcal{M}^{c}\\\\odot x_{0}^{r}+\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(1\\u2212\\u2133c)\\u2299(\\u03b2\\u200b\\u2133\\u03b1\\u200bx0r+(1\\u2212\\u03b2\\u200b\\u2133\\u03b1)\\u200bx0t)\\\\displaystyle(1-\\\\mathcal{M}^{c})\\\\odot(\\\\beta\\\\mathcal{M}^{\\\\alpha}x_{0}^{r}+(1-\\\\beta\\\\mathcal{M}^{\\\\alpha})x_{0}^{t})\\n\\n(12)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u03b2\\\\beta is a hyperparameter that controls the strength of the overall guidance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLLFF [19]\\n\\n\\nMip-NeRF 360 [1]\\n\\n\\nWaymo \\u2009 [29]\\n\\nDM Type\\nw/o Finetune\\nOnly RGBs\\n3D Render\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPSNR\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nSSIM\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nLPIPS\\u2193\\\\downarrow\\n\\n\\nPSNR\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nSSIM\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nLPIPS\\u2193\\\\downarrow\\n\\n\\nKID\\u2193\\\\downarrow\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3DGS [9]\\n\\n18.10\\n0.633\\n0.265\\n21.83\\n0.643\\n0.239\\n0.155\\nN/A\\nN/A\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\nFreeFix + SDXL\\n19.93\\n0.695\\n0.237\\n22.68\\n0.685\\n0.213\\n0.150\\nImage\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\nFreeFix + Flux\\n20.12\\n0.700\\n0.221\\n23.02\\n0.689\\n0.208\\n0.147\\nImage\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\n\\nViewExtrapolator [16]\\n\\n18.27\\n0.614\\n0.338\\n20.84\\n0.591\\n0.332\\n0.180\\nVideo\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\n\\nNVS-Solver [45]\\n\\n11.99\\n0.351\\n0.560\\n12.45\\n0.266\\n0.631\\n0.289\\nVideo\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2718\\n\\n\\n\\nDifix3D+ [37]\\n\\n18.86\\n0.658\\n0.239\\n22.43\\n0.661\\n0.210\\n0.143\\nImage\\n\\u2718\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\n\\nStreetCrafter [41]\\n\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\n0.157\\nVideo\\n\\u2718\\n\\u2718\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 1: Quantitative Comparison with Baselines.

We select LLFF [19] as the evaluation dataset for forward-facing scenes, Mip-NeRF 360 [1] for object-centric scenes, and Waymo [29] for driving scenes.\\nFor the LLFF and MipNeRF datasets, which contain relatively dense captured images, we select sparse or partially observed views as the training set and choose an extrapolated view trajectory that is distant from the views in the training set. The Waymo dataset only provides captured images from a single pass down the street, making it relatively sparse. We only utilize the front cameras as the training set and then translate or rotate the training cameras to create the test views. Details on the design of the training and testing views are provided in the supplementary materials.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWaymo / 143481\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWaymo / 177619\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3DGS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nViewExtrapolator [45]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStreetCrafter [41]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDifix3D+ [37]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFreeFix\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 7: Qualitative Comparisons on Waymo [29]. FreeFix provide superior performance compared to ViewExtrapolator and StreetCrafter, and is comparable to Difix3D+ in the Waymo dataset. In some cases, FreeFix refines the scene even better than Difix3D+.\\n\\n\\n\\nModel Settings and Baselines: \\nFreeFix utilizes two powerful IDMs as its backbone: SDXL [22] and Flux [13], to showcase the capabilities of our method.\\nFor baseline selection, we consider various methods with different settings. For fine-tuning-free methods, we select ViewExtrapolator [16], and NVS-Solver [45] as the baseline. While ViewExtrapolator refines 3DGS with generated views like ours, NVS-Solver employs VDMs as the final renderer, without using 3D renderers, which consumes more computational resources during rendering.\\nFor methods that require fine-tuning of DMs, we choose Difix3D+ [37] and StreetCrafter [41] as baselines. StreetCrafter focuses on urban scenes and requires both LiDAR and RGB observations as input, while Difix3D+ is more generalizable and only requires RGB images. For all methods with a 3D renderer, we apply nearly the same 3D refining steps, ensuring that there are sufficient refining steps for the models to converge.\\n\\n\\nEvaluation Metrics: \\nFor the experiments on LLFF and MipNeRF, we adopt the most common settings for quantitative assessments, which include the evaluation of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS [51]. In the case of the Waymo dataset, where no ground truth is available for the test images, we utilize KID [2] for quantitative assessments.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.1 Comparison with Baselines\\n\\nWe evaluate FreeFix using SDXL [22] and Flux [13] as the diffusion backbone on the LLFF, Mip-NeRF 360, and Waymo datasets. This includes a quantitative comparison in Tab.\\u00a01 and qualitative comparisons in Fig.\\u00a05 and Fig.\\u00a07 against baseline methods. Although FreeFix utilizes only IDMs as the backbone and does not require fine-tuning of the DMs, it still demonstrates performance that is comparable to, or even surpasses, methods that use VDMs or require fine-tuning, both in quantitative and qualitative assessments.\\n\\n\\nSpecifically, ViewExtrapolator [16], which uses opacity masks as guidance, shows slight improvements in LLFF, although the improvement is less significant compared to our confidence-guided solution.\\nMoreover, it fails to provide improvements in Mip-NeRF 360 and Waymo.\\nThis is due to the fact that ViewExtrapolator uses the nearest view from a set of training views as the reference view to generate the test views in a video diffusion model.\\nWhile using the nearest training view as the reference view in SVD performs well in the forward-facing scenes in LLFF, where the test views are closer to the training views, this is usually not the case for Mip-NeRF 360 and Waymo, hence ViewExtrapolator yields degraded performance.\\n\\n\\nDifix3D+ demonstrates the most generalizability and powerful performance across our baselines. FreeFix surpasses Difix3D+ [37] in LLFF and Mip-NeRF 360, while providing comparable performance in Waymo.\\nWe attribute this to the generalizability of DMs. Although Difix3D+ is finetuned on DLV3D [15] and may have encountered similar scenes to those in LLFF and Mip-NeRF 360, the domain gap between datasets still weakens the generalizability of Difix3D+. In contrast, our method maintains the original generalizability of DMs learned from web-scale datasets. Regarding the Waymo dataset, Difix3D+ is fine-tuned on a large-scale in-house driving dataset, where driving scenes are highly structured and exhibit relatively small inter-class differences, making them easier for models to learn.\\n\\n\\nStreetCrafter [41] is tailored for urban scenes and requires LiDAR as input; for this reason, we only conduct experiments with this model on the Waymo dataset. In contrast to the original setting in StreetCrafter, our setup only provides the front camera to color the LiDAR points, which highlights the limitations of StreetCrafter in this context.\\nNVS-Solver produces less satisfying results compared to other methods, which may be attributed to inaccurate depth estimation and warping results. We provide NVS-Solver results in supplementary materials.\\n\\n\\nPlease note that we compute the average score across scenes for each dataset. We provide a quantitative comparison for each scene, along with additional qualitative comparisons in the supplementary materials.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.2 Ablation Study\\n\\nImage Diffusion Models vs Video Diffusion Models: \\nFreeFix can also be applied to VDMs without temporal down-sampling, such as SVD [3]. Although SVD offers inherent consistency across frames, it suffers from blurriness compared to more advanced IDMs. We conduct an ablation study on the scene from MipNeRF-360/Garden to provide quantitative and qualitative comparisons in Tab.\\u00a02 and Fig.\\u00a06. Additionally, we include the results from ViewExtrapolator [16] on the same scene. While ViewExtrapolator also uses SVD as its backbone, it employs an opacity mask as guidance, which disentangles the effects of the differences in diffusion model backbones and helps demonstrate the effectiveness of our confidence guidance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPSNR\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nSSIM\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nLPIPS\\u2193\\\\downarrow\\n\\nGuidance\\n\\n\\n3DGS\\n18.38\\n0.415\\n0.357\\nN/A\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVE [16] + SVD\\n\\n17.86\\n0.409\\n0.505\\nOpacity\\n\\n\\nFreeFix + SVD\\n19.03\\n0.453\\n0.331\\nCertainty\\n\\n\\nFreeFix + SDXL\\n19.41\\n0.517\\n0.294\\nCertainty\\n\\n\\nFreeFix + Flux\\n19.72\\n0.520\\n0.287\\nCertainty\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 2: Quantitative Ablation on Diffusion Models Selection. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPSNR\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nSSIM\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nLPIPS\\u2193\\\\downarrow\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRaw Flux [13]\\n\\n19.23\\n0.390\\n0.389\\n\\n\\n+ Confidence Guidance\\n19.32\\n0.435\\n0.349\\n\\n\\n+ Interleave Strategy\\n19.65\\n0.517\\n0.293\\n\\n\\n+ Overall Guidance\\n19.72\\n0.520\\n0.287\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 3: Ablation Study on Modules of FreeFix.

We conduct an ablation study of these modules on the scene from MipNeRF-360/Garden, as shown in Tab.\\u00a03. We perform experiments starting from a raw Flux model, which we slightly modify to function as an image-to-image model. We progressively add components from FreeFix to demonstrate the necessity of these techniques.\\n\\n\\n\", \"5 Conclusion\": \"\\n\\n5 Conclusion\\n\\nIn this paper, we present FreeFix, a method for fixing artifacts and improving the quality of 3DGS without fine-tuning DMs. FreeFix demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across various datasets and possesses strong capabilities for deployment with future, more advanced DMs.\\nHowever, FreeFix still has certain limitations. It may encounter failure cases when extrapolated views lead to excessive artifacts with minimal credible guidance. Additionally, the updating process for 3DGS is relatively slow and challenging to converge over dozens of refining steps. These challenges suggest opportunities for future work on designing more robust and efficient methods for integrating 3D reconstruction with 2D generative models.\\n\\n\\nAcknowledgements:\\nThis work is supported by NSFC under grant 62202418, U21B2004, and 62441223, the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2021ZD0114501, and Scientific Research Fund of Zhejiang University grant XY2025028.\\n\\n\\n\", \"6 3DGS Fisher Information Derivation\": \"\\n\\n6 3DGS Fisher Information Derivation\\n\\nThe uncertainty attribute of 3DGS in this paper is defined as:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9e\\u00af\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2=\\u2212log\\u2061pf\\u200b(\\u03c0|\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)\\\\mathcal{\\\\bar{C}}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}=-\\\\log p_{f}(\\\\pi|\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})\\n\\n(13)\\n\\n\\nUnder the following regularity conditions, \\u2212log\\u2061pf\\u200b(\\u03c0|\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)-\\\\log p_{f}(\\\\pi|\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}) can be viewed as a loss term for Fisher information.

The process for generating testing views in the Waymo dataset is straightforward; we translate the camera by 2 to 3 meters or rotate it by 10 to 15 degrees horizontally. However, the design for LLFF and Mip-NeRF 360 is not as straightforward, as we aim to construct extrapolated views that have ground truth images. For this reason, we cannot generate trajectories freely; instead, we need to create partitions for the testing and training sets. We present visualizations of the training and testing cameras in Fig.\\u00a08 from these scenes to illustrate the design of the extrapolated views. For some scenes where obvious extrapolated trajectories cannot be directly extracted, we aim to make the training views sparse in order to produce relative extrapolated trajectories.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLLFF\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfern\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhorns\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nleaves\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfortress\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntrex\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMip-NeRF 360\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngarden\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstump\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbicycle\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncounter\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nkitchen\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 8: Design of Training and Testing Views Design.

In this subsection, we provide a comparison between using the uncertainty mask from [7] as guidance and our certainty mask as guidance. Specifically, for rendered uncertain masks \\u2133c\\u00af\\\\mathcal{M}^{\\\\bar{c}}, we use 1\\u2212\\u2133c\\u00af1-\\\\mathcal{M}^{\\\\bar{c}} as guidance to experiment on Garden in Mip-NeRF 360. As shown in Fig.\\u00a010 and Tab.\\u00a07, the images generated using uncertainty masks as guidance exhibit significant inconsistency, resulting in less satisfying performance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPSNR\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nSSIM\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nLPIPS\\u2193\\\\downarrow\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUncertainty Mask\\n19.30\\n0.515\\n0.310\\n\\n\\nCertainty Mask\\n19.72\\n0.520\\n0.287\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 7: Quantitative Comparison between Uncertainty and Certainty as Guidance. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n9.3 Ablation on Affine Transform\\n\\nWe apply an affine transform during 3D refinement to prevent 3DGS from learning slightly different color styles generated by diffusion models. In this subsection, we present an ablation study for this component on Garden in Mip-NeRF 360. As shown in Tab.\\u00a08, although removing the affine transform slightly improves PSNR, it results in a decrease in SSIM and LPIPS. Furthermore, as illustrated in Fig.\\u00a012, removing the affine transform results in large floaters in testing views, which can significantly lower human sensory preference.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNVS-Solver [45]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFreeFix\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 11: Comparisons on FreeFix and NVS-Solver.

These processes are characterised by a high degree of uncertainty coupled with demands of logistical flexibility, which traditionally implies the requirement for expensive reprogramming and reconfiguration of robots. This is of interest in domains such as nuclear decommissioning, robotic disassembly of complex products for recycling and re-use, and even areas such as robotic surgery or demolition with robotised demolition equipment. Nonetheless, challenges exist in automated planning and task execution for destructive operations. Whereas manufacturing paradigms centre around achieving high dimensional tolerances and precise control on a known workpiece, for disassembly, the precise location of cutting is less important (few mm as opposed to \\u03bc\\\\mum) while the precise sequence of cutting operations may not be known in advance. This uncertainty has motivated various approaches to robotic cutting, consisting of goal-conditioned trial-and-error & revision [25, 26], 3D reconstruction & planning [9], and online learning & adaptation [18, 22].\\n\\n\\nReinforcement learning (RL) has been applied with success to a variety of contact-rich tasks [2, 23], including robotic cutting [31, 15], particularly with difficult-to-model environments with complex robot-environment interactions, but are nonetheless data intensive. Whereas simulation environments offer reduced complexity and overhead of data collection, differences between simulated and physical cutting processes limit the applicability of adaptive methods to real-world tasks. Examples of such differences include motor backlash, tool wear, chattering, cross-domain mismatch of process and model parameters and other disturbances. These differences motivate the use of domain adaptation methods to align representations or behaviours across domains with minimal real-world supervision. These can be broadly separated into unified feature representation learning, model-based correction, and model-free synthesis of target domain examples.\\n\\n\\nDomain adaptive methods include [29] in which policies are trained on a cross-domain latent feature representation by aligning source and target domain distributions. A related concept applied to milling was proposed in [31] based on a cross-domain meta-model, trained on pairwise unified feature representations. Similarly, adversarial losses using domain discriminators have been employed for cross-domain tool wear classification [20]. Reconstruction-based methods have also been employed to jointly model observation and class distributions[12]; this concept has been further developed based on conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs) [33] wherein CVAE feature representations were used to train an RL policy, while feature representations are aligned across domains.\\n\\n\\nModel-based approaches have previously also been employed for domain adaptation, wherein a source domain task model is augmented with a corrective model based on physics-informed approaches [24], neural networks [13, 5] or Gaussian process (GP) models [19, 27] learned from target domain data. In our previous work, [16] we proposed an imitation learning framework in which a GP corrective model was learned from multiple cutting demonstrations. Nonetheless, model-based approaches incur limitations of modelling assumptions under which the models are introduced, and incur a dataset overhead, particularly for deep predictive modelling approaches.\\n\\n\\nRelating to the aforementioned approaches is direct alignment of observations across domains via translation or generative models. In the context of milling, [4] proposed a domain adaptation method for condition monitoring of different milling tools based on a generative CNN. Similarly, [30], proposed a domain adaptive imitation learning framework from visual demonstrations based on CycleGAN [32]. Generation at object level has also been proposed [17] wherein a StyleGAN image translation model is trained object-wise on weakly-paired cross-domain datasets for 6D pose estimation. CVAEs have also been employed for domain adaptation via synthesis of novel target domain examples [28].\\n\\n\\nNeural style transfer has been extensively researched in the context of image processing [11, 10]. Recently, this concept has been extended to motion execution. Thus far, its application has been limited largely to expressive stylised motions mirroring that of human operators [8, 7]. Nonetheless, its applicability to synthesise novel trajectories with characteristics of diverse human operators presents a compelling case for its application to other domain adaptation problems. Recently, this has been applied for dataset augmentation tasks [6]. A limitation of the aforementioned methods is lack of a suitable pairing mechanism for style and content, as well as lack of feature extractor backbones prevalent in image processing tasks. For transfer learning, addressed this problem [3] by building on the concept of conditional adversarial domain adaptation [21] to achieve feature-level style transfer for transfer learning. Nonetheless, adversarial alignment can be difficult to train, with well-known problems of mode collapse and vanishing gradients. Whereas these developments have been applied to time series classification problems, application of style transfer for RL policy transfer is, to the best of our knowledge, largely unexplored.\\n\\n\\nThis paper extends our previous example-based approach for sim-to-real adaptation to arbitrary real world examples. As with our previous work, our approach does not require re-training of classifiers or encoder networks to adapt to new scenarios (different disturbance forces, differing sensor dynamics, etc.). In contrast to prior work that applies neural style transfer primarily for stylised motion synthesis or dataset augmentation, we apply it as a trajectory-level domain adaptation mechanism for robotic skill transfer. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a latent-space pairing mechanism for content and style that operates without paired examples or retraining; (2) a novel transfer framework based on neural style transfer that does not require labelled or reward-supervised data from the target domain; and (3) empirical evaluation on robotic cutting, a task where conventional reinforcement learning pipelines are difficult to apply due to the absence of reward signal in the real-world deployment environment. An overview of our framework is provided in Figure 1.\\n\\n\\nFigure 1: Overview of proposed framework. In the first stage, a simulation of cutting mechanics is used to generate an expert policy and a variational autoencoder (VAE) is trained on simulated trajectory windows. In the second stage, the VAE encoded representations are used to generate pairings between a simulated and real world dataset which are used as style targets. Finally, expert trajectories are used to train a learner target domain policy with the generated observation windows.\\n\\n\", \"Style transfer framework\": \"\\nStyle transfer framework\\n\\nVariational autoencoder\\n\\nThe variational autoencoder (VAE) consists of two neural networks: an encoder q\\u03d5\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc9b|\\ud835\\udc99)q_{\\\\phi}(\\\\boldsymbol{z}|\\\\boldsymbol{x}) that approximates the posterior over latent variables \\ud835\\udc9b\\u2208\\u211dL\\\\boldsymbol{z}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{L}, and a decoder p\\u03b8\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc99|\\ud835\\udc9b)p_{\\\\theta}(\\\\boldsymbol{x}|\\\\boldsymbol{z}) that reconstructs the data from the latent representation.

Training was carried out with the Adam optimiser, with model hyperparameters established via manual search, reported in Table Style transfer. Both encoder and decoder networks were implemented as strided convolutional networks with 3 layers. Batch normalisation was further employed to accelerate convergence and reduce training instability. The encoder architecture is visualised in Figure 2.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: Overview of VAE encoder architecture; layer indices for style transfer are demarcated.\\n\\n\\nThe VAE training dataset consisted of a mixture of 680 on-policy and off-policy simulated trajectories. We consider a trajectory as a multivariate time series of length TT which comprises a sequence of state-action pairs:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u03c4={(\\ud835\\udc99t,\\ud835\\udc9at)}t=1T\\\\tau=\\\\{(\\\\boldsymbol{x}_{t},\\\\boldsymbol{y}_{t})\\\\}_{t=1}^{T}\\n\\n(4)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udc99t\\u2208\\u211dNS\\\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{N_{S}}, \\ud835\\udc9at\\u2208\\u211dNA\\\\boldsymbol{y}_{t}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{N_{A}} are the states, actions at time tt respectively. Each trajectory \\u03c4\\\\tau is divided into overlapping windows of length NN, resulting in a set of state and action windows:\\n\\n\\n\\nx(i)=\\\\displaystyle x^{(i)}=\\n[xt,xt+1,\\u2026,xt+N]\\u2208\\u211dN\\u00d7NS\\\\displaystyle[x_{t},x_{t+1},\\\\dots,x_{t+N}]\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\times N_{S}}\\n\\n(5)\\n\\n\\n\\ny(i)=\\\\displaystyle y^{(i)}=\\n[yt,yt+1,\\u2026,yt+N]\\u2208\\u211dN\\u00d7NA\\\\displaystyle[y_{t},y_{t+1},\\\\dots,y_{t+N}]\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\times N_{A}}\\n\\n(6)\\n\\n\\nThe window width NN and latent code dimensionality emerge as tunable parameters for which a trade-off exists between the temporal context afforded to the model, reproduction accuracy and saliency of the latent space. Through preliminary experiments, this was reflected in increased RMS error of the autoencoder reconstructions and reduced average cosine similarity between simulated and real world embeddings with increasing NN and dimensionality respectively. A window size of N=100N=100 samples (2 seconds) was identified as providing the best trade-off between these factors.\\n\\n\\n\\nPolicy adaptation\\n\\nWe adopt a similar approach to our previous work [16] to adapt a pre-trained policy to observations synthesised from unlabelled target domain data. In this procedure, an \\u201cexpert\\u201d policy \\u03c0e\\\\pi_{e} is initially trained in a simulation environment with a physically-informed cutting model, as introduced in our previous work [14], with model parameters from Table Style transfer. The expert was trained initially for 32000 episodes using the proximal policy optimisation (PPO) algorithm with domain randomisation of material properties. A translation function f:\\u211dN\\u00d7NS\\u2192\\u211dN\\u00d7NAf:\\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\times N_{S}}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\times N_{A}} is applied to each state window:\\n\\n\\n\\nx(g,i)\\u2063\\u2217=f\\u200b(x(c,i))x^{(g,i)*}=f(x^{(c,i)})\\n\\n(7)\\n\\n\\nand translated states paired with the corresponding expert action on x(c)x^{(c)} to generate a labelled dataset\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9f={(x(g,i),\\u03c0e\\u200b(x(c,i)))}.\\\\mathcal{D}=\\\\{(x^{(g,i)},\\\\pi_{e}(x^{(c,i)}))\\\\}.\\n\\n(8)\\n\\n\\nWe subsequently train a target domain policy \\u03c0g\\\\pi_{g}, initialised as \\u03c0g=\\u03c0e\\\\pi_{g}=\\\\pi_{e} on \\ud835\\udc9f\\\\mathcal{D} using behavioural cloning. We note this procedure can be extended to alternative imitation learning algorithms (such as DAgger) provided ff can be inferred during generation of source windows x(c,i)x^{(c,i)}. Under the assumption that the environment satisfies the Markov property, the policy learning process is unaffected by the windowing procedure. As the full trajectories do not need to be reconstructed, limitations of other methods such as requirement for blending or enforcing temporal consistency are inapplicable to this work [7]. Furthermore, as each trajectory is decomposed into T\\u2212N+1T-N+1 windows, the windowing approach has the effect of significantly augmenting the training data.\\n\\n\\n\\nStyle transfer\\n\\nIn this work, we consider neural style transfer[11] as a translation function wherein x(g)\\u2063\\u2217x^{(g)*} arise from solving the style transfer optimisation problem:\\n\\n\\n\\nx(g,i)\\u2063\\u2217=arg\\u2061minx(g,i)\\u2061(wc\\u200bLc\\u200b(x,x(c,i))+ws\\u200bLs\\u200b(x,x(s,j)))x^{(g,i)*}=\\\\arg\\\\min_{x^{(g,i)}}\\\\left(w_{c}L_{c}(x,x^{(c,i)})+w_{s}L_{s}(x,x^{(s,j)})\\\\right)\\n\\n(9)\\n\\n\\nwhere wcw_{c} and wsw_{s} are the content and style weights, respectively and LcL_{c}, LsL_{s} are content and style loss contributions respectively. The content loss is defined as:\\n\\n\\n\\nLc=\\u2211l\\u2211i,j12\\u200bNl\\u200b(Fi\\u200bj(c,l)\\u2212Fi\\u200bj(g,l))2L_{c}=\\\\sum_{l}\\\\sum_{i,j}\\\\frac{1}{2N_{l}}\\\\left(F^{(c,l)}_{ij}-F^{(g,l)}_{ij}\\\\right)^{2}\\n\\n(10)\\n\\n\\nwhere F(c,l)F^{(c,l)}, F(g,l)F^{(g,l)} are the feature outputs of layer ll for the content and generated output respectively. The style loss similarly is expressed as\\n\\n\\n\\nLs=\\u2211l\\u2211i,j14\\u200bNl2\\u200bMl2\\u200b(Gi\\u200bj(s,l)\\u2212Gi\\u200bj(g,l))2L_{s}=\\\\sum_{l}\\\\sum_{i,j}\\\\frac{1}{4N^{2}_{l}M^{2}_{l}}\\\\left(G^{(s,l)}_{ij}-G^{(g,l)}_{ij}\\\\right)^{2}\\n\\n(11)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udc06(s,l)\\\\mathbf{G}^{(s,l)} is the style Gram matrix of layer ll outputs F(s,l)F^{(s,l)}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc06(s,l)=F(s,l)\\u200bF\\ud835\\uddb3\\u200b(s,l)\\\\mathbf{G}^{(s,l)}=F^{(s,l)}F^{\\\\mathsf{T}(s,l)}\\n\\n(12)\\n\\n\\nand similarly for \\ud835\\udc06(c,l)\\\\mathbf{G}^{(c,l)}. The generated windows were initialised as\\n\\n\\n\\nx(g,i)=x(c,i)x^{(g,i)}=x^{(c,i)}\\n\\n(13)\\n\\n\\nand (9) optimised by gradient descent using the Adam optimiser. The relative content-style weighting wc/w\\u200bsw_{c}/w{s} was tuned manually through a grid-search procedure. Figure 3 shows the effect of content-style weighting on their relative loss contributions. At low values of wc/w\\u200bsw_{c}/w{s}, the total loss is dominated by increasing content reconstruction error; the generated windows diverge substantially from the original windows with marginal effect on style reconstruction. Hence, wc/w\\u200bsw_{c}/w{s} was reduced until diminishing returns on the (unweighted) style reconstruction loss was observed.

The points are coloured according to their class (simulation, blue / real world, red) with intensity according to the cosine similarity of their closest match, diverging from 0.5. The area of each real world embedding point is directly proportional to the number of times the corresponding window was matched.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA compelling advantage of encoder or classifier-based approaches is that they operate on unpaired cross-domain datasets. To improve the realism of generated trajectories, we employ a pairing mechanism that takes advantage of the unsupervised feature representations learned from the source domain data to generate weakly paired content and style windows. An intuitive analogue would be matching images with similar composition and subjects, reminiscent of the weak paring mechanism in [17]. In the first stage, the real world dataset is encoded in entirety by the encoder network to generate a dataset of embeddings. In the second stage, the simulated content window(s) are encoded and a content-style pairing matrix is constructed by the pairwise cosine similarity between x(c,i)x^{(c,i)}, x(s,j)x^{(s,j)} representations as\\n\\n\\n\\nSi\\u200bj=zi\\u22c5zj\\u2016zi\\u2016\\u22c5\\u2016zj\\u2016S_{ij}=\\\\frac{z_{i}\\\\cdot z_{j}}{||z_{i}||\\\\cdot||z_{j}||}\\n\\n(14)\\n\\n\\nIn the last stage, the closest match real embedding is paired with the simulated embedding. For each row ii, the index of the most similar pairing was obtained by:\\n\\n\\n\\nj\\u2217\\u200bi=arg\\u2061max\\u2061j,Si\\u200bjj^{*}i=\\\\arg\\\\max{j},S_{ij}\\n\\n(15)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor windows where the pairing diverged substantially from the content, the optimisation process introduced mean shifts into the observations, as well as introducing artefacts from the encoding process. Following the intuition of [10], qualitatively, we observed that pre-aligning the means of the content and style windows resulted in higher quality generated outputs. Figure 5 shows a representation of the content-style pairings generated by the pairing procedure. The data show the formation of distinct clusters according to simulated and real world trajectories. Unsurprisingly, the real world embeddings with the most matches were found predominantly at the intersections of the clusters. This parasitic behaviour is reminiscent of the mode-collapse phenomenon in generative-adversarial networks. Nonetheless, around 50% of real world points were matched at least once, with matched windows dispersed throughout the latents, indicating good coverage of the real world dataset.\\n\\n\\nFor adaptation, 50 episodic trajectories were collected in source domain with the expert policy, which formed the content dataset. For this work, the style dataset consisted of 148 off-policy trajectories collected from the real world. We note this is not a hard requirement; dataset size is motivated primarily by avoiding breakdown of the pairing and style transfer mechanism where content and style windows diverge substantially.\\n\\n\\n\\nExperimental setup\\n\\nAs with our previous work, experimental validation was carried out on a KUKA LBR iiwa R820 14kg collaborative robot equipped with a wrist-mounted motorised slitting saw tool. The iiwa was connected via the Fast Research Interface (FRI) to a Robot Operating System (ROS) workstation with a communication frequency of 500Hz. The workstation consisted of an Intel i7-8086K CPU, NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti GPU with 11GB VRAM, and 32GB RAM. The robot was equipped with a motorised slitting saw tool; whereas geometric parameters of the tool reflect the training parameters in Table Style transfer, the number of teeth was doubled to introduce further cross-domain mismatch.\\n\\n\\nThe cutting task was represented as a single conventional milling pass over an material with variable geometry, following a nominal trajectory defined at the material surface. As proof of principle, the reference path was defined manually with respect to the surface for all case studies. During the cutting task, the policy provides as output a translational stiffness, incremental offset to the depth of cut (DoC), and the feed rate, relative to the planned (nominal) trajectory. The nominal feed rate was chosen as 0.75 m/min. The controller damping gain \\ud835\\udc0ad\\\\mathbf{K}_{d} was adjusted independently according to the stiffness to provide a damping ratio of 1.0 (i.e. critically damped).

However, our method in principle is applicable to different types of sensors, such as those built in to the iiwa, provided real world examples collected with such sensors. Prior to each trial, the force sensor was biased at the start of the trajectory.

To demonstrate the performance of each method on a range of materials, cutting trials were carried out on polyurethane foam, cardboard, corrugated plastic, mica and aluminium. We further establish 3 separate case studies on each material to evaluate the policy performance under different path planning conditions. We evaluate each method by task completion time, average path deviation, average tool load, material removed volume (MRV), and similarity of the adopted action trajectories to the source domain expert actions, averaged over 5 trials per material for each strategy, and aggregated over all materials. To mitigate effects of drift (e.g. tool wear, temperature, calibration errors), trials for each strategy were interleaved.\\n\\n\\nComparison methods\\n\\nFor the subsequent real world experiments, we adopt the following terminology to denote comparison methods: \\u2018Expert\\u2019 refers to the unadapted source simulation expert policy, as transferred directly to the real world task. \\u2018BC\\u2019, or standalone behavioural cloning, represents our previous work, in which the simulation is augmented with a Gaussian process (GP) regression model trained on aligned demonstrations from 14 preliminary experiments on aluminium and mica. \\u2018CVAE\\u2019 represents a conditional variational autoencoder using the same real world dataset as adopted for style transfer. Note in this instance, the encoder itself is trained on the entire dataset of both real world and simulation data, conditioned on a one-hot domain label (simulation or real world). Simulated data are encoded as with the style transfer approach, however, at decoding time, the one-hot class label is swapped to generate a synthetic window of the desired class. \\u2018CycleGAN\\u2019 is also introduced as a comparison method. In this instance, the surrogate real world dataset is synthesised by the sim-to-real generator network. With all methods, the generator / encoder architecture was chosen equivalent to Table Style transfer. For CycleGAN, a smaller discriminator network, with output channels [64,128,256][64,128,256] was used due to mitigate the well-known \\u2018vanishing gradient\\u2019 problem during GAN training. All other hyperparameters were chosen to be equivalent to the CycleGAN study. All methods were employed with behavioural cloning as per the self-supervision procedure introduced in this work. Additionally, as a benchmark, we include a \\u201cbaseline\\u201d strategy in which the process parameters are held constant at the nominal feed rate (0.75m/min) and depth of cut of 1 mm, applied to all materials.\\n\\n\\n\\nPlanar material case study\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) Flat\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) DoC offset\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(c) Curved\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 7: Boxplot summary of performance metrics for the style transfer trained policy and comparison methods, aggregated over all materials. Metrics include task completion time, average path deviation, average load force, average (normalised) dynamic time warping (DTW) distance between each strategy and the simulation expert policy (lower better), and material removed volume (MRV, higher better).\\n\\n\\nEach strategy was initially tested on a planar material, with the reference path calibrated at the material surface. For the calibration procedure, the surface was modelled as a warped plane interpolated between 4 corner points obtained via guarded move with a force threshold of 1N, with the exception of foam, where contact was confirmed visually. The performance of each strategy for the planar case study is outlined in Figure 7(a). To aid interpretation, the significance of the difference in metrics was tested via one-way ANOVA. The normality and homoscedasticity assumptions of ANOVA were tested via the Shapiro-Wilk and Levene methods respectively. A significance level of \\u03b1=0.05\\\\alpha=0.05 was used for all tests. Metrics that did not satisfy the assumptions were transformed via Box-Cox transform:\\n\\n\\n\\ny={x\\u03bb\\u22121if\\u200b\\u03bb\\u22600log\\u2061(x)otherwisey=\\\\begin{cases}x^{\\\\lambda}-1&\\\\mathrm{if}\\\\,\\\\lambda\\\\neq 0\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\log(x)&\\\\mathrm{otherwise}\\\\end{cases}\\n\\n(18)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u03bb\\\\lambda is chosen to maximise the log-likelihood of the transformed data under a normality assumption. In the case of completion time and average force, the assumptions of ANOVA were satisfied (Shapiro p=0.361p=0.361, p=0.355p=0.355; Levene p=0.0689p=0.0689, p=0.0983p=0.0983, respectively). Average path deviation and MRV did not satisfy the normality assumption after transformation, and in this case the Kruskal-Wallis test was adopted without transformation. For both task completion time and average force, one-way ANOVA revealed significant effects of strategy on performance (F=61.1F=61.1, p=1.14\\u00d710\\u221227p=1.14\\\\times 10^{-27}; F=6.74F=6.74, p=6.52\\u00d710\\u22125p=6.52\\\\times 10^{-5} respectively) between strategy and these performance metrics.\\n\\n\\nTo examine the effect of individual strategy on the performance metrics, the Tukey Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) was used for ANOVA, and the Dunn post-hoc test for Kruskal-Wallis. No significant difference in task completion times was found between style transfer and BC, whereas the former outperformed all other methods. Style transfer had the largest effect relative to GAN (\\u22121.00-1.00 s) and the smallest relative to the Expert (\\u22120.329-0.329 s). For path deviation, style transfer significantly differed from the Expert (\\u22121.50-1.50 mm, p=0.000196p=0.000196) and GAN (0.4510.451 mm, p=0.005074p=0.005074) strategies, however, results were inconclusive for BC (p=0.560p=0.560) and CVAE (p=0.109p=0.109). Style transfer was further found to significantly outperform the Expert and BC strategies in minimising average force (\\u22121.273-1.273 N, p=0.0001p=0.0001; \\u22120.651-0.651 N, p=0.0352p=0.0352), however, no significant difference was found between style transfer and the CVAE and GAN strategies (p=0.867p=0.867, p=0.611p=0.611). The choice of strategy was found to have no conclusive effect on MRV (Kruskal H=2.87H=2.87, p=0.578p=0.578). This result appears surprising in light of the differing action selection apparent for each strategy, particularly in DoC.\\n\\n\\nTo examine the effect of the adaptation methods on the agent actions, the actions taken during each trial were compared with 50 simulated experiments (i.e. source domain) carried out with the source domain expert, and the similarity of action trajectories evaluated by normalised dynamic time warping (DTW) distance. The strategies that adopt actions that are more broadly similar to the source domain expert will score lower on this metric than those that deviate substantially from the expert behaviour. The expert policy itself was included in this comparison since it is being applied to the target domain. We report effect sizes as Hedges\\u2019 gg. Clear differences between the strategies were indicated (Kruskal H=1930H=1930, p=0.0p=0.0), with style transfer yielding large improvements relative to the Expert g=0.875g=0.875 and GAN g=2.18g=2.18, a moderate improvement for CVAE g=0.575g=0.575 and a small reduction in performance relative to BC g=\\u22120.370g=-0.370. Post-hoc testing indicated a high significance level in these effects (p\\u22643.65\\u00d710\\u221217p\\\\leq 3.65\\\\times 10^{-17}) for all comparisons.\\n\\n\\nTo examine the behaviour of each strategy in more detail and enable qualitative comparisons between each strategy, the action trajectories adopted by each policy during an example trial on foam and mica are presented in Figure 8. From Figure 8(a), 8(d), 8(g), 8(j), the action trajectories were broadly similar between BC and style transfer across both materials. Style transfer adopts a more correct behaviour of reducing the feed rate prior to engagement with the material, as compared with BC. Conversely, the GAN policy diverges substantially from the expert behaviour which corroborates the DTW metric results. All adapted policies adopted a more consistent DoC throughout both trials than the unadapted expert policy. Differences between the policy behaviour on each material were mainly evident in the DoC behaviour, transverse stiffness (KxK_{x}) and, to a lesser extent, the normal stiffness (KzK_{z}).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFlat\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2005DoC offset\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2002\\u200aCurved\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) Foam - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) Foam - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(c) Foam - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(d) Foam - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(e) Foam - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(f) Foam - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(g) Mica - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(h) Mica - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(i) Mica - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(j) Mica - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(k) Mica - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(l) Mica - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 8: Comparison of agent actions for foam and mica for planar, DoC offset and curved case studies respectively. Actions include the relative to nominal feed rate adjustment, with 0 corresponding to no change and 1 to double the nominal feed rate, depth of cut (DoC), and controller stiffness in transverse, feed direction and normal directions respectively (Kp,xK_{p,x}, Kp,yK_{p,y}, Kp,zK_{p,z}. Units of KpK_{p} are chosen consistent with (16)).\\n\\n\\n\\nRobustness to path planning offset\\n\\nTo examine the robustness of the method to path planning errors - for example, due to errors in calibration, surface position estimation or noise, we further examine the performance of all strategies with a path planning offset of 1mm, inset into the ground truth material surface. The performance of each strategy was evaluated over 3 trials per strategy, per material.\\n\\n\\nSimilarly to the planar case, strategy significantly impacted task completion times (ANOVA F=17.0F=17.0, p=9.94\\u00d710\\u221210p=9.94\\\\times 10^{-10}); style transfer again differed significantly from all strategies except BC (Tukey HSD p=0.0694p=0.0694), and improvements over other strategies being similar to the planar case study, albeit more consistent across strategies (effect size range \\u22120.658-0.658-\\u22120.850-0.850 s). Whereas path deviation was also influenced by strategy (ANOVA F=4.61F=4.61, p=0.00235p=0.00235), post-hoc testing indicated only GAN differed significantly from the BC (p=0.0047p=0.0047) and Expert (p=0.0125p=0.0125) strategies. Although group means were more concentrated than in the planar case, path deviation was notably more consistent across trials for style transfer, CVAE, and GAN, implying these strategies were better able to tolerate the path planning offset and maintain stable path tracking across materials. MRV was again unaffected by strategy (Kruskal-Wallis H=2.61H=2.61, p=0.624p=0.624), and contrasting the planar case study, no significant differences were observed in average tool load (ANOVA F=1.06F=1.06, p=0.382p=0.382). Similarly to the planar case study, there was a clear separation between the strategies in terms of similarity to expert actions (Kruskal H=688H=688, p=9.33\\u00d710\\u2212148p=9.33\\\\times 10^{-148}). Post-hoc testing indicated style transfer was distinct from the comparison methods, with the least significant result being with CVAE (p=0.0314p=0.0314), small negative effects for BC g=\\u22120.321g=-0.321 and CVAE g=\\u22120.151g=-0.151 and positive effects relative to Expert g=0.682g=0.682 and GAN g=1.31g=1.31 strategies.\\n\\n\\nFigure 8(b), 8(e), 8(h), 8(k) shows the agent actions for the offset case study. All strategies exhibited a more sporadic DoC behaviour than the planar case study, with style transfer exhibiting the most consistent DoC behaviour across both materials, and matching more closely to the planar case study behaviour, supporting observations regarding the consistency of the path deviation. All strategies exhibited a more aggressive variation in stiffness relative to the planar case study, indicating a compensatory response to the offset cutting depth.\\n\\n\\n\\nNon-planar surfaces\\n\\nWe further showcase the performance of each strategy when both material and surface geometry are altered to varying degrees of curvature. Consistent with the planar case study, the reference path with respect to the surface was assumed already known; however, we note that numerous path-planning methods have been proposed in the context of milling, including the case where surface geometry is unknown [9]. For this case study, we assume the material is a thin plate under pure bending, with the surface modelled as a section of a truncated oblique cone \\u2013 in other words, an interpolation between two circular arcs. The arc parameters for each endpoint were derived from a 3-point estimation obtained similarly to the planar case study. Curvatures ranged between 2.36 m-1 and 4.04 m-1 across materials. Cardboard was excluded from the set of materials since the maximum curvature generated during preliminary experiments did not meaningfully differ from the previous case studies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) Polyurethane foam\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) Corrugated plastic\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(c) Mica\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(d) Aluminium\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 9: 3D plot of TCP paths adopted by each strategy with respect to the material surface - qualitative defects are shown in the \\u201cexpert\\u201d and \\u201cGAN\\u201d strategies, which exhibit transverse path deviations on the stiffer materials.\\n\\n\\nAs with the prior case studies, strategy had a significant effect on completion time (Kruskal H=38.5H=38.5, p=8.44\\u00d710\\u22128p=8.44\\\\times 10^{-8}) and in post-hoc testing, style transfer outperformed all strategies except BC (p=0.529p=0.529). The effect of style transfer largely reflected the planar case study, with \\u22121.00-1.00 s relative to GAN, and \\u22120.413-0.413 s relative to the Expert. Differences in path deviation were inconclusive compared to the planar case study, (Kruskal H=9.77H=9.77, p=0.0445p=0.0445) with the most significant result from post-hoc testing arising between GAN and style transfer (p=0.0589p=0.0589); however, differences in average force were more pronounced (ANOVA F=7.71F=7.71, p=0.000025p=0.000025), with style transfer significantly outperforming GAN (\\u22121.25-1.25 N, p=0.0001p=0.0001) but not the other strategies. Corroborating the previous case studies, MRV did not significantly differ between strategies (Kruskal H=2.15H=2.15, p=0.708p=0.708). Furthermore, action similarity again revealed clear separation between strategies (Kruskal H=1390H=1390, p=2.64\\u00d710\\u2212300p=2.64\\\\times 10^{-300}), with style transfer exhibiting the largest deviation from GAN (g=2.14g=2.14) and significant differences from all others (BC g=\\u22120.264g=-0.264, CVAE g=0.503g=0.503, Expert g=0.487g=0.487).\\n\\n\\nThe agent actions, as shown in Figure 8(c), 8(f), 8(i), 8(l), show similar behaviours to the offset case study, with differences in DoC behaviour becoming more pronounced, particularly for the expert policy. CycleGAN adopted a highly sporadic action profile in feed rate and stiffness, particularly for the foam trials. A hypothesis for this behaviour is that the curved material presents a more challenging case for the agent and the much lower cutting forces limit information available to the agent to make decisions. Therefore, the actions resemble those at the beginning of the planar trials in which the agent is in free space and has no information about the contact state or tool engagement. Style transfer and BC both exhibited less consistent DoC behaviour than the planar case studies on foam, however, produced smoother action trajectories that were strongly correlated to the engagement state - for example, contact initiation was well-demarcated for both strategies.\\n\\n\\nFigure 9 shows a representative example of the 3D TCP positions adopted by each strategy for a single cutting trial. The TCP trajectories adopted exhibited clear defects for the expert and GAN trials, which were evident across both low and high stiffness materials. On the low stiffness materials, such as in Figure 9(a) these were evident as low-frequency irregularities, resembling a random walk, whereas for the high stiffness materials, this was exhibited as a higher frequency \\u201cwobble\\u201d, which were unrelated to known phenomena such as chattering. These defects were suppressed or entirely absent during the BC, CVAE and style transfer trials, with these methods yielding similar qualitative improvements across all materials.\\n\\n\\n\", \"Discussion\": \"\\nDiscussion\\n\\nFor the cutting task, the proposed method was evaluated based on task completion times, average path deviation, tool load (average force), material removed volume, behavioural similarity to expert action trajectories in source domain, and qualitatively by the action trajectories, ability to maintain consistent cutting conditions (e.g. depth of cut), as well as TCP trajectories. Relative to the comparison methods \\u2013 consisting of the unadapted source domain expert policy (Expert), our previous work (BC), conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) and CycleGAN (generative adversarial network) \\u2013 the proposed method based on style transfer consistently achieved significant reductions in task completion time across all case studies. Compared to BC and CVAE, style transfer showed comparative performance but did not uniformly surpass them across all metrics.\\n\\n\\nThe reduced influence of strategy in the offset path case study is consistent with the constraint imposed by insetting the path into the material, which limits the ability of the agent to regulate the true DoC. It also implies a common limitation of these methods in modelling out-of-distribution task conditions, wherein offsetting the reference path and nominal feed rate introduces concept shift in the optimal actions across domains in addition to covariate shift in the observations. Although path deviation was more consistent across style transfer, CVAE and GAN strategies than for BC and the expert policy, overall improvements were primarily inconclusive. It is plausible that the inconclusive effects may be attributable to the reduced number of samples for the offset case study.\\n\\n\\nQualitatively, the style transfer trained policy demonstrated improved behavioural stability relative to the model-free approaches, with smoother action trajectories and more consistent control of depth-of-cut and stiffness, which was robust to perturbations in surface geometry and cutting path, and corroborated by higher action similarity to the source domain expert relative to all strategies except BC. The irregular path deviations observed in the TCP trajectories were attributable to the largely sporadic action trajectories of the expert policy, and, to a lesser extent, the GAN strategy. For the stiffer materials, deviations in the path are caused by contact instabilities resulting from interaction between the policy stiffness and the environment stiffness. These behaviours were largely absent with the BC, CVAE and style transfer strategies.\\n\\n\\nWe hypothesise that the poorer performance of CycleGAN-based domain adaptation arises from its limited capacity to preserve task-relevant structure in the translated observations, which has been documented in related work [1]. While CycleGAN has been effective in visual domains where semantic content remains invariant under style changes\\u2014e.g. image-to-image translation, its application to time-series control tasks may disrupt temporal dependencies or distort dynamics-critical features, leading to degraded policy performance.\\n\\n\", \"Conclusion\": \"\\nConclusion\\n\\nAn example-based approach for sim-to-real transfer in robotic control was proposed based on the principle of neural style transfer. Empirical results on a robotic cutting task demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable or superior performance to our previous work, conditional variational autoencoders, and CycleGAN-based time series translation across diverse materials and geometric scenarios, while substantially relaxing the assumptions of our previous example-based work. The proposed method is sample-efficient, demonstrated with 148 off-policy real world trajectories versus 32000 for initial policy training, and avoids the need for training domain discriminator, generator or corrective models, a crucial limitation of previously proposed adaptation methods.\\n\\n\\nWe note the limitation that this work does not explicitly address differing cross-domain target (action) distributions or compatibility of generated trajectories with robot kinematic and dynamic constraints. We posit such constraints could be formulated as part of the optimisation process wherein physical feasibility losses are jointly optimised with style and content losses, and represents a possible extension of this work. Additionally, the quality of generated trajectories and pairings is expected to deteriorate with low coverage of real-world examples, weak content-style match similarity, or parasitic matching where a small subset of real trajectories dominate the pairing.\\n\\n\", \"Data availability\": \"\\nData availability\\n\\nThe datasets generated during and/or analysed during the current study are available in the Figshare repository, DOI 10.6084/m9.figshare.28983659.\\n\\n\", \"Funding Declaration\": \"\\nFunding Declaration\\n\\nThis work was supported by the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) project \\u201cResearch and Development of a Highly Automated and Safe Streamlined Process for Increase Lithium-ion Battery Repurposing and Recycling\\u201d (REBELION) under Grant 101104241.\\n\\n\", \"Acknowledgements\": \"\\nAcknowledgements\\n\\nThe authors would further like to acknowledge Abdelaziz Wasfy Shaarawy, Carl Meggs and Christopher Gell respectively for assistance with experimental validation, design of material holder and cutter tool for experiments herein.\\n\\n\", \"Author contributions\": \"\\nAuthor contributions\\n\\nConceptualisation - A.R. and J.H.; data curation - J.H.; formal analysis - J.H.; funding acquisition - A.R. and R.S.; investigation - J.H.; methodology - J.H. and A.R.; project administration - A.R. and R.S.; software - J.H.; resources - J.H., A.R. and R.S.; supervision - A.R. and R.S.; validation - J.H. and A.R.; visualisation - J.H.; writing (original draft) - J.H.; writing (review & editing) - J.H. and A.R. and R.S.\\n\\n\", \"Competing interests\": \"\\nCompeting interests\\n\\nThe authors declare no competing interests.\\n\\n\"}, \"bibliography\": {\"[1]\": \"\\n[1]\\nH.

naturally reason about object functionality, identify the relevant functional element (e.g., a heater knob or thermostat), and interact with it using an appropriate body configuration.\\nHowever, performing such functionally-correct interactions in a novel 3D environment remains challenging for embodied intelligent agents, as it requires a holistic understanding of scene semantics and the human actions that the environment affords\\u00a0[7, 4].\\nIn this work, we investigate to generate realistic and functional interactions between a 3D human body and a novel scene, conditioned on open-vocabulary task descriptions.\\nAn effective solution to this problem benefits a wide range of applications, including embodied AI, robotics, game production, and video generation, among many others.\\n\\n\\nThe synthesis of 3D human-scene interaction (HSI) has been extensively studied, with existing methods broadly falling into two paradigms.\\nData-driven approaches learn generative models from paired 3D interaction data, achieving high visual fidelity and realistic human poses in controlled settings.\\nFor example, COINS\\u00a0[47] models human body poses conditioned on scene geometry and text commands, while TriDi\\u00a0[29] learns a joint distribution over human pose, object geometry, and interaction signals using diffusion models.\\nDespite their effectiveness, such methods rely on large-scale, high-quality paired interaction datasets and typically require explicit interaction specifications (e.g., \\u201csitting on a sofa\\u201d), limiting their ability to generalize to diverse novel scenes.\\nTo alleviate data dependency, recent work has explored zero-shot or training-free pipelines that leverage pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to generate human-scene interactions.\\nRepresentative examples include GenZI\\u00a0[18], which reconstructs 3D human bodies from multi-view image synthesis, and GenHSI\\u00a0[20], which integrates image-based object grounding with 3D body fitting from a single input image.\\nWhile these methods improve flexibility and support open-vocabulary task prompts, they are primarily effective for general human-scene interactions describing physical relations or motions, e.g., \\u201csitting on a sofa\\u201d or \\u201cwalking on a bridge\\u201d.\\n\\n\\nIn contrast, many real-world tasks like \\u201copen the window\\u201d involve interactions at a functional level, where a human must identify and interact with fine-grained functional elements in the 3D scene to complete the task, such as finding and contacting a window handle to open a window, as shown in Fig.\\u00a01.\\nWe refer to this setting as functional human-scene interaction.\\nThis problem poses fundamental challenges, as it requires reasoning about both the semantics of functional elements in 3D scenes and the 3D human poses needed to establish appropriate contacts.\\nExisting methods typically lack explicit reasoning about object functionality and the corresponding human-scene contact, leading to interactions that are either geometrically implausible or functionally incorrect.\\n\\n\\nIn this work, we propose FunHSI, a training-free, functionality-driven\\nframework that enables functional human-scene interactions from\\nopen-vocabulary task prompts.\\nGiven a set of posed RGB-D images and a task prompt, FunHSI reasons about the functionality of the 3D scene and synthesizes a 3D human that interacts with the scene in a functionally correct manner to accomplish the specified task.\\nAs illustrated in Fig.\\u00a02, FunHSI is built upon three key components.\\nFirst, we introduce a functionality-aware contact reasoning module to identify task-relevant functional elements in the scene, reconstruct their 3D geometry, and infer high-level interaction patterns via contact graph reasoning.\\nThe resulting contact graph explicitly encodes the contact relationships between the human body and both functional and supporting scene elements, serving as a structured representation that bridges high-level task intent and low-level physical interaction.\\nSecond, we propose a functionality-aware body initialization module that synthesizes a human performing the task in the image and estimates the corresponding initial 3D body and hand poses.\\nTo mitigate hallucinations during human synthesis, we introduce a human inpainting optimization strategy that automatically evaluates and improves the generated human pose configuration.\\nIn addition, since image-based synthesis may produce left-right hand inconsistencies with the inferred contact graph, we further refine the contact graph to align contact specifications with the synthesized human.\\nFinally, a body refinement module places the initialized 3D human into the scene and performs stage-wise optimization to jointly refine body pose and human-scene contacts, ensuring both physical plausibility and functional correctness.\\n\\n\\nWe conduct experiments on the SceneFun3D dataset\\u00a0[4] under both functional and general human-scene interaction settings.\\nExtensive qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our design and the superior performance of our framework compared to existing baselines.\\nIn addition, we show that FunHSI is compatible with recent feed-forward 3D reconstruction methods, such as MapAnything\\u00a0[15], and can generate realistic human-scene interactions in reconstructed city scenes.\\nIn summary, our contributions are as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nWe propose FunHSI, a training-free framework that generates functionally correct human-scene interactions from open-vocabulary task prompts. FunHSI extends beyond general interactions to support functional interaction scenarios across diverse scenes and actions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nWe introduce a robust optimization strategy for inpainting humans and contact graph refinement scheme, providing valuable insights for functional human-scene interactions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that FunHSI achieves strong performance in both functional and general HSI tasks compared to existing baselines. Additionally, FunHSI exhibits strong flexibility and generalization on realistic city scenes captured using smartphones.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"2 Related Work\": \"\\n\\n2 Related Work\\n\\nData-driven Human-scene Interaction Synthesis.\\nHuman-scene interaction (HSI) models how humans behave within 3D environments\\u00a0[46, 48, 41, 11, 13, 38], and many works focus on generating static interactions that place the human body into the scene\\u00a0[32, 19, 45, 10, 47, 11, 18, 20].\\nA conventional approach is to learn a generative model from paired data.\\nPLACE\\u00a0[44] employs a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to generate body-scene proximity conditioned on scene geometry, followed by body fitting to produce plausible interactions.\\nPOSA\\u00a0[10] predicts detailed body-scene contact relations via a graph-based CVAE.\\nCOINS\\u00a0[47] incorporates textual prompts to jointly generate pelvis placement and body pose for object-centric interactions.\\nA closely related research line addresses human-object interaction (HOI), particularly for interactions with small objects where accurate hand-object contact is essential\\u00a0[34, 37, 17, 6].\\nGOAL\\u00a0[34] and SAGA\\u00a0[37] first generate target grasping poses and then in-fill motions that reach these targets.\\nCG-HOI\\u00a0[6] explicitly enforces contact constraints to jointly model human and object motions.\\nDespite their effectiveness, existing data-driven HSI/HOI approaches rely on large-scale paired interaction data,\\n\\u00a0[9, 43, 1, 12, 13, 22].\\nThe cost and complexity of acquiring such high-quality multimodal data pose fundamental challenges to scalability and generalization.\\n\\n\\nZero-shot HSI Synthesis\\nTo overcome the data limitation, training-free methods that leverage pre-trained VLMs have been proposed.\\nGenZI\\u00a0[18] generates 3D bodies based on image generation models.\\nGiven a description of the task, human pixels are generated individually in tens of images, which are obtained by rendering the same 3D scene from different views.

Given a set of posed RGB-D images, and a task prompt, FunHSI generates 3D humans interacting with functional elements (e.g., \\u201cknob\\u201d or \\u201cswitch\\u201d) to perform the specified task. First, functionality-aware contact reasoning detects elements to be interacted with, constructs a contact graph, and performs segmentation. Next, functionality-aware body initialization performs human inpainting, pose estimation, and contact graph refinement, where a generator\\u2013evaluator loop ensures no hallucination and correct contact targeting. Finally, body refinement performs optimization to improve the body configuration and the contact.\\n\\n\", \"3 FunHSI\": \"\\n\\n3 FunHSI\\n\\nAs shown in Fig.\\u00a02, FunHSI takes as input a set of posed RGB-D images and a task prompt, and generates a 3D human performing task-specific interactions with the scene.\\nOverall, FunHSI consists of three key modules.\\nFirst, the functionality-aware contact reasoning module (Sec.\\u00a03.2) identifies task-relevant functional elements in the scene, reconstructs their 3D geometry, and performs contact graph reasoning to produce the high-level interactions.\\nSecond, the functionality-aware body initialization module (Sec.\\u00a03.3) leverages the inferred functional elements and contact relations to synthesize a human in the image and estimate the 3D body and the hand poses.\\nFinally, the body refinement module (Sec.\\u00a03.4) places the initialized 3D body into the 3D scene and performs stage-wise optimization to refine the body and hand poses, and human-scene contacts.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1 Preliminaries\\n\\nWe denote the SMPL-X model\\u00a0[27] as \\u2133\\u200b(\\u03b2,r,\\u03c6,\\u03b8)\\\\mathcal{M}(\\\\beta,r,\\\\varphi,\\\\theta),\\nwhere \\u03b2\\u2208\\u211d10\\\\beta\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{10} denotes the shape parameters,\\nr\\u2208\\u211d3r\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{3} the root translation,\\n\\u03c6\\u2208\\u211d3\\\\varphi\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{3} the root orientation,\\nand \\u03b8=[\\u03b8b,\\u03b8h]\\\\theta=[\\\\theta^{b},\\\\theta^{h}] the pose parameters.\\nHere, \\u03b8b\\u2208\\u211d63\\\\theta^{b}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{63} and \\u03b8h\\u2208\\u211d90\\\\theta^{h}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{90} represent the body and the hand poses, respectively.\\nGiven these body parameters, it can produce a body mesh with 10,475 vertices via forward kinematics (FK).\\nIn addition, the body signed distance field (SDF), denoted as \\u03a8\\u200b(\\u03b2,r,\\u03c6,\\u03b8)\\\\Psi(\\\\beta,r,\\\\varphi,\\\\theta), is computed via VolumetricSMPL\\u00a0[24].\\nSince both \\u2133\\u200b(\\u22c5)\\\\mathcal{M}(\\\\cdot) and \\u03a8\\u200b(\\u22c5)\\\\Psi(\\\\cdot) are differentiable, provided external constraints on the body, inverse kinematics (IK) can be performed via backpropagation to optimize the body parameters and the contacts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2 Functionality-aware Contact Reasoning\\n\\nSince the task prompt typically specifies a high-level goal without explicitly describing which elements to interact with or how the interaction should be carried out, FunHSI must automatically reason about scene functionality, identify task-relevant functional elements, and infer appropriate contact relations with the human body.\\nAccordingly, this module consists of two stages: functionality grounding and reconstruction and LLM-based contact graph reasoning.\\n\\n\\nFunctionality grounding and reconstruction.\\n\\nGiven a task prompt such as \\u201cadjust the temperature\\u201d, we first identify task-relevant functional elements in the RGB images using a vision-language model (VLM).\\nIn our implementation, we employ Gemini-2.5-Flash\\u00a0[2] to infer candidate functional elements conditioned on the task description.\\nBased on the task prompt and the inferred functional elements,\\nwe first localize task-relevant functional elements in the input views and obtain their pixel-level segmentation masks.\\nWe then back-project each posed RGB-D frame into 3D using known camera parameters to reconstruct the scene point cloud, following prior work\\u00a0[28, 4].\\nThe 2D segmentation masks of the functional elements are then back-projected and fused across views to produce 3D masks corresponding to the functional elements.\\n\\n\\n\\nLLM-based contact graph reasoning.\\n\\nWhile the detected functional elements indicate what scene components are relevant to the task, they do not specify how the human body should interact with them, nor how the body is supported by the surrounding scene geometry (e.g., the floor).\\nTo represent human-scene contact relations in a structured form, following prior work\\u00a0[9, 20], we define a property graph:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udca2=(\\ud835\\udcb1,\\u2130),\\ud835\\udcb1=\\ud835\\udcb1body\\u222a\\ud835\\udcb1scene,\\\\mathcal{G}=(\\\\mathcal{V},\\\\mathcal{E}),\\\\quad\\\\mathcal{V}=\\\\mathcal{V}_{\\\\text{body}}\\\\cup\\\\mathcal{V}_{\\\\text{scene}},\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udcb1body\\\\mathcal{V}_{\\\\text{body}} denotes a predefined set of SMPL-X body parts, and\\n\\ud835\\udcb1scene\\\\mathcal{V}_{\\\\text{scene}} denotes functional or supporting scene elements.\\nEach edge (b,o)\\u2208\\u2130(b,o)\\\\in\\\\mathcal{E} encodes a contact relation between a body part b\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb1bodyb\\\\in\\\\mathcal{V}_{\\\\text{body}} and a scene element o\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb1sceneo\\\\in\\\\mathcal{V}_{\\\\text{scene}}.\\nBody-part names are annotated on the SMPL-X template (see Sup. Mat. Fig.\\u00a011) and are fixed across all experiments.\\nWe then prompt a large language model (LLM), e.g., GPT-4o\\u00a0[25] or Gemini, with the task description, the detected functional elements, the predefined body-part set, and additional structured instructions that encourage task-complete and human-like interactions.\\nThe LLM outputs a contact graph \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G}, which specifies the involved body parts, the functional and supporting scene elements, and their corresponding contact relations (see Fig.\\u00a02).\\nSimilar to functional elements, inferred supporting elements (e.g., the floor) are segmented in each image and lifted to 3D masks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3 Functionality-aware Body Initialization\\n\\nAlthough the inferred contact graph \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G} provides high-level interaction constraints, directly fitting a 3D human body to the scene remains challenging due to the strong sensitivity of optimization-based methods to initialization.\\nTo obtain a reliable initial body configuration, we first synthesize a human performing the task in the image and then estimate the corresponding 3D body and hand poses.\\nSince image-based synthesis may introduce left-right inconsistencies with the inferred contact graph, we update the contact graph to align its laterality with the initialized human body.\\n\\n\\nHuman inpainting with contact-aware reasoning.\\n\\nWe employ a vision-language model (VLM), specifically Gemini\\u00a0[2], to synthesize human pixels in the input image.\\nTo encourage the generated human to perform the specified task and establish appropriate contacts with the scene, we introduce a contact-aware prompting strategy.\\nIn addition to the input image without humans and the task description, the inpainting prompt incorporates the inferred contact graph and the detected object bounding boxes.\\nThese cues explicitly specify task-relevant functional and supporting elements, guiding the model to generate human body parts in spatial proximity to the target objects.\\nHowever, image inpainting models may hallucinate, unintentionally altering scene structures or introducing spurious objects, as illustrated in Fig.\\u00a03.\\nTo mitigate this issue, we adopt an iterative generator-critic scheme inspired by LLM-based optimization\\u00a0[40].\\nA separate Gemini model is used as a critic to compare the inpainted image with the original input and verify that (1) the generated human performs the specified task, (2) contacts with functional elements are plausible, and (3) no irrelevant or non-existent objects are introduced.\\nIf any criterion is violated, the generator is prompted to regenerate the human appearance.\\nThis process is repeated until all criteria are satisfied or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\\nIn practice, we find that 3-4 iterations are sufficient and outperform single-pass image generation.\\n\\n\\nFigure 3: Visualization of the human inpainting optimization process. By automatically evaluating the human inpainting results, the image generation process is optimized to produce more reliable outcomes, thus strongly facilitating the subsequent body optimization step.\\n\\n\\n\\n3D human estimation.\\n\\nGiven the human-inpainted image, we estimate SMPL-X parameters to initialize the 3D human body.\\nSpecifically, we estimate the global translation \\ud835\\udc2b\\\\mathbf{r}, root orientation \\ud835\\udf4b\\\\bm{\\\\varphi}, and body pose \\ud835\\udf3db\\\\bm{\\\\theta}^{b} using CameraHMR\\u00a0[26], and estimate hand pose parameters \\ud835\\udf3dh\\\\bm{\\\\theta}^{h} using WiLoR\\u00a0[30].\\nFor cases where the hands are occluded in the image, \\ud835\\udf3dh\\\\bm{\\\\theta}^{h} is initialized to the default relaxed hand pose of SMPL-X.\\nThe estimated SMPL-X body is then transformed from the camera coordinate system to the world coordinate system using the known camera pose, ensuring that the human body and the scene are represented in a common reference frame.\\nThe resulting SMPL-X parameters provide a task-specific and geometrically plausible initialization, which substantially simplifies the subsequent body refinement stage.\\n\\n\\n\\nContact graph refinement.\\n\\nWe observe that image generation models may fail to consistently capture left-right spatial relations.\\nFor example, as shown in Fig\\u00a09, the synthesized image may depict the left hand contacting a handle, even when the inferred contact graph specifies contact with the right hand.\\nSuch laterality inconsistencies between the initialized body configuration and the contact graph can lead to invalid human-scene interactions during subsequent refinement.\\nTo address this issue, we refine the contact graph by aligning its laterality with the inpainted image.\\nSpecifically, we project the left and right wrist joints of the estimated 3D body onto the 2D image plane and compute their distances to the center \\ud835\\udc1co\\\\mathbf{c}_{o} of the functional element bounding box:\\n\\n\\n\\ndleft=\\u2016\\u03a0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc30left)\\u2212\\ud835\\udc1co\\u20162,dright=\\u2016\\u03a0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc30right)\\u2212\\ud835\\udc1co\\u20162,d_{\\\\text{left}}=\\\\|\\\\Pi(\\\\mathbf{w}_{\\\\text{left}})-\\\\mathbf{c}_{o}\\\\|_{2},\\\\quad d_{\\\\text{right}}=\\\\|\\\\Pi(\\\\mathbf{w}_{\\\\text{right}})-\\\\mathbf{c}_{o}\\\\|_{2},\\n\\n(2)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u03a0\\u200b(\\u22c5)\\\\Pi(\\\\cdot) denotes the 3D-to-2D projection operator and\\n\\ud835\\udc30left,\\ud835\\udc30right\\\\mathbf{w}_{\\\\text{left}},\\\\mathbf{w}_{\\\\text{right}} are the 3D wrist joints.\\nIf dleft>dright+\\u03b4d_{\\\\text{left}}>d_{\\\\text{right}}+\\\\delta, where \\u03b4\\\\delta is a small tolerance to account for projection noise and pose estimation errors, we apply a symmetric left-right swap to all hand-related nodes in the contact graph \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G} (e.g., palm and finger nodes).\\nOtherwise, the contact graph remains unchanged.\\nThis simple distance-based criterion is effective at resolving left-right ambiguities across different scenes and camera viewpoints.\\nThe refined contact graph is denoted as \\ud835\\udca2\\u2217\\\\mathcal{G}^{*}.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4 Optimization-based Body Refinement\\n\\nTo refine the body pose, global configurations, and the contact, a conventional solution is to jointly optimize all SMPL-X parameters.\\nHowever, we find in our trials that such joint optimization often leads to unrealistic HSI results, such as unnatural facing orientation and penetration to the scene.\\nTherefore, we propose a two-stage coarse-to-fine optimization method to gradually refine the initial body state.\\nThis will not only preserve nuances in the initial body pose, but also improve the body-scene contact, making the 3D human body performing the specified task.\\n\\n\\nOptimization objective.\\n\\nTo penalize body-scene interpenetration, we define a collision loss based on the signed distance field (SDF) of the SMPL-X body.\\nGiven a scene point cloud \\ud835\\udcab={\\ud835\\udc29j}j=1N\\\\mathcal{P}=\\\\{\\\\mathbf{p}_{j}\\\\}_{j=1}^{N}, the collision loss is formulated as\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2112col=\\u2211j=1Nmax\\u2061(0,\\u2212\\u03a8\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc29j;\\u03b2,r,\\u03c6,\\u03b8)),\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{col}}=\\\\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\\\max\\\\bigl(0,\\\\;-\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{p}_{j};\\\\beta,r,\\\\varphi,\\\\theta)\\\\bigr),\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u03a8\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc29j;\\u03b2,r,\\u03c6,\\u03b8)\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{p}_{j};\\\\beta,r,\\\\varphi,\\\\theta) denotes the SDF value of point \\ud835\\udc29j\\\\mathbf{p}_{j} with respect to the current SMPL-X body configuration, computed using VolumetricSMPL\\u00a0[24].\\nThis loss penalizes scene points that lie inside the body volume and evaluates to zero when no interpenetration occurs.\\n\\n\\nTo further enforce task-consistent body-scene contact, we introduce a contact loss guided by the refined contact graph \\ud835\\udca2\\u2217\\\\mathcal{G}^{*}.\\nFor each contact pair (b,o)\\u2208\\ud835\\udca2\\u2217(b,o)\\\\in\\\\mathcal{G}^{*}, where bb denotes a body part and oo a corresponding scene element, we minimize the distance between the body vertices \\ud835\\udcb1b\\\\mathcal{V}_{b} and the scene points \\ud835\\udcaeo\\\\mathcal{S}_{o} using a single-sided Chamfer distance:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2112con=\\u2211(b,o)\\u2208\\ud835\\udca2\\u22171|\\ud835\\udcb1b|\\u200b\\u2211\\ud835\\udc2f\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb1bmin\\ud835\\udc2c\\u2208\\ud835\\udcaeo\\u2061\\u2016\\ud835\\udc2f\\u2212\\ud835\\udc2c\\u201622.\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{con}}=\\\\sum_{(b,o)\\\\in\\\\mathcal{G}^{*}}\\\\frac{1}{|\\\\mathcal{V}_{b}|}\\\\sum_{\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{V}_{b}}\\\\min_{\\\\mathbf{s}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{S}_{o}}\\\\|\\\\mathbf{v}-\\\\mathbf{s}\\\\|_{2}^{2}.\\n\\n(4)\\n\\n\\nThe single-sided formulation pulls the body toward the intended contact surfaces without over-constraining the scene geometry.\\nFor foot contacts, the loss is computed only on vertices near the toes and heel, allowing fine-grained poses such as tiptoe standing.\\nTo regularize the pose space during optimization, we incorporate a VPoser prior\\u00a0[27].\\nSpecifically, we define\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2112prior=\\u2016\\ud835\\udc33\\u201622,\\ud835\\udc33=VPoserEnc\\u200b(\\u03b8b),\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{prior}}=\\\\|\\\\,\\\\mathbf{z}\\\\,\\\\|_{2}^{2},\\\\qquad\\\\mathbf{z}=\\\\mathrm{VPoserEnc}(\\\\theta^{b}),\\n\\n(5)\\n\\n\\nwhere VPoserEnc\\u200b(\\u22c5)\\\\mathrm{VPoserEnc}(\\\\cdot) denotes the VPoser encoder and \\ud835\\udc33\\\\mathbf{z} is encouraged to follow a standard normal distribution.\\nThe overall optimization

as\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2112=\\u03bbcol\\u200b\\u2112col+\\u03bbcon\\u200b\\u2112con+\\u03bbprior\\u200b\\u2112prior,\\\\mathcal{L}=\\\\lambda_{\\\\text{col}}\\\\,\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{col}}+\\\\lambda_{\\\\text{con}}\\\\,\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{con}}+\\\\lambda_{\\\\text{prior}}\\\\,\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{prior}},\\n\\n(6)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u03bbcol\\\\lambda_{\\\\text{col}}, \\u03bbcon\\\\lambda_{\\\\text{con}}, and \\u03bbprior\\\\lambda_{\\\\text{prior}} are scalar weighting coefficients.\\n\\n\\n\\nTwo-stage optimization strategy.\\n\\nAs summarized in Algorithm\\u00a01, the refinement is carried out in two stages.\\nIn the first stage, we optimize the 3D translation rr, the global body orientation around the gravity axis \\u03c6g\\\\varphi_{g}, and the arm pose parameters \\u03b8arm\\\\theta^{\\\\text{arm}}.\\nJointly optimizing the arm articulation and global translation enables the hands to reach and establish contact with the target functional elements specified by the task.\\nTo preserve physical realism, the global orientation is restricted to rotations around the gravity axis, which prevents unnatural body tilting while still allowing feasible interaction configurations and obstacle avoidance.\\nThe second stage focuses on improving physical plausibility and contact stability.\\nIn this stage, we optimize the full body pose \\u03b8\\\\theta together with the 3D translation rr, with particular emphasis on the ankle joints to ensure stable foot-ground contact.\\nA smaller learning rate \\u03b72\\\\eta_{2} (set to 15\\u200b\\u03b71\\\\frac{1}{5}\\\\eta_{1}) is adopted to allow subtle pose adjustments without disrupting the refined configuration.\\nThe pose prior loss

alignment between the synthesized 3D interaction and the input text prompt.\\nWe compute a CLIP score\\u00a0[31] by rendering each synthesized interaction into three views, extracting image-text cosine similarities using CLIP ViT-B/32, and averaging the scores across views.\\nFor non-collision score, we compute a non-collision score based on penetration between the SMPL-X body mesh and the reconstructed scene point cloud, following VolumetricSMPL\\u00a0[24].\\nFor non-functional contact distance, we use the average Chamfer distance between the human body mesh and supporting scene elements (e.g., the floor or chair).\\nThe functional contact distance assesses whether the synthesized interaction has appropriate contact with task-relevant functional elements, e.g., a hand touching a door handle in the task of \\u201copen the door\\u201d.\\nThis metric is computed as the Chamfer distance between the functional element region and the interacting human hands.\\n\\n\\n\\nBaselines.\\n\\nTo our knowledge, no existing method explicitly targets functional human-scene interactions in 3D.\\nWe therefore compare our approach with the most closely related baselines.\\nGenZI\\u00a0[18] synthesizes human appearances in individual views and reconstructs a 3D body via multi-view fitting.\\nFor a fair comparison, we adapt GenZI to operate on the same three posed RGB-D images used in our benchmark.\\nGenHSI\\u00a0[20] proposes a training-free pipeline for generating long human-scene interaction videos by combining keyframe planning, 3D-aware inpainting, and motion animation.\\nWe extend GenHSI with functional element detection, perform human inpainting from randomly sampled views, and apply its original body-fitting strategy to our inputs.\\nDue to these adaptations, the resulting baselines are denoted as GenZI* and GenHSI*, respectively.\\n\\n\\nFigure 4: Qualitative results on SceneFun3D for general human-scene interaction.\\nWe compare GenZI*, GenHSI*, and our FunHSI with non-functional prompts such as sitting, squatting, and walking.\\n\\n\\nFigure 5: Qualitative results on SceneFun3D for functional human-scene interaction.\\nGiven open-vocabulary functional commands (e.g., adjusting temperature, dialing a number, switching a radio station) and posed RGB-D inputs, we compare GenZI*, GenHSI*, and our FunHSI.\\nExisting methods struggle to reason about task intent and often interact with incorrect objects or miss fine-grained functional components.\\nIn contrast, FunHSI accurately identifies task-relevant functional elements and generates physically plausible 3D human poses that establish correct contacts with both large objects and small functional parts (e.g., knobs, dials, cabinet handles), demonstrating robust functional grounding and contact reasoning.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.1 Comparison to Baselines\\n\\nQuantitative Evaluation.\\n\\nTable\\u00a01 summarizes the quantitative comparison between our FunHSI method and the modified baselines.\\nOverall, FunHSI performs competitively in the general HSI setting and substantially outperforms the baselines in functional HSI.\\nFor general HSI, FunHSI achieves comparable semantic consistency (0.2498) while improving physical plausibility.\\nIn particular, it attains the lowest contact distance (0.7481), outperforming GenZI* (0.8496) and GenHSI* (0.7599), together with a slightly higher non-collision score (0.9929), indicating that improved contact quality is not achieved at the cost of increased body-scene penetration.\\nFor functional HSI, FunHSI consistently yields the best results, with the lowest functional contact distance (0.2968) and the lowest overall contact distance (0.1837), significantly outperforming GenZI* and GenHSI*.\\nAlthough GenHSI* achieves a marginally higher non-collision score (0.9925 vs. 0.9917), FunHSI maintains comparable physical plausibility and semantic consistency (0.2540).\\n\\n\\nFigure 6: Illustration of functionality awareness of FunHSI.\\nGiven the same 3D scene, FunHSI generates distinct human-scene interactions conditioned on different high-level task prompts.\\n\\n\\nFigure 7: Qualitative results on in-the-wild scenes.\\nWe show our FunHSI results on real-world scenes captured by smart phone in Munich.\\n\\n\\n\\nQualitative Evaluation.\\n\\nFig.\\u00a04 and Fig.\\u00a05 show qualitative comparisons under both general and functional human-scene interaction scenarios.\\nFor functional tasks that require identifying and interacting with task-relevant elements (e.g., operating knobs, opening drawers, or interacting with small appliances), the baseline methods often fail to localize the correct functional targets or produce inaccurate hand-object contacts.\\nIn contrast, FunHSI consistently grounds interactions on the appropriate functional elements and generates realistic human-scene interactions.\\nFor general interaction prompts such as sitting, squatting, or standing near scene objects, FunHSI produces perceptually plausible body poses and interactions, achieving performance comparable to the baseline methods.\\nFig.\\u00a06 further illustrates the functional awareness of FunHSI: given different high-level task prompts abouth the same scene or object, the generated bodies accomplish the intended tasks with diverse and appropriate poses.\\nAdditional visual results are provided in the supplementary material.\\n\\n\\n\\nGeneralization to City Scenes.\\n\\nFig.\\u00a07 presents qualitative results on in-the-wild city scenes captured using a smartphone in public spaces in a city.\\nGiven multi-view RGB images reconstructed into 3D scenes, FunHSI successfully generates plausible human-scene interactions for diverse real-world tasks, such as opening an emergency door, buying a parking ticket, and sitting on a bench.\\nDespite the challenges posed by cluttered environments, noisy geometry, and incomplete reconstructions, our method robustly grounds interactions to the correct functional elements and produces physically plausible body poses.\\nThese results demonstrate that FunHSI generalizes beyond curated indoor datasets and is compatible with real-world feedforward 3D reconstruction pipelines.\\nMore visualizations are provided in Fig.\\u00a012 of the supplementary material.\\n\\n\\nFigure 8: User study of 3D human\\u2013scene interaction synthesis on our curated dataset. Participants show a strong preference for our method over baselines (i.e., GenHSI\\u00a0[20] and GenZI\\u00a0[18]) under both functional and general HSI settings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.2 Perceptual User Study\\n\\nWe conduct a perceptual user study to evaluate the visual quality and interaction realism of synthesized 3D human\\u2013scene interactions.\\nThe study is performed on the SceneFun3D benchmark under both functional HSI and general HSI settings.\\nParticipants are presented with rendered interaction results generated by FunHSI and the baseline methods, and are asked to select the most plausible and realistic human\\u2013scene interaction for each task.\\nThe evaluation focuses on overall perceptual quality, including the appropriateness of body pose, physical plausibility of contact, and consistency with the given task prompt.\\nFig.\\u00a08 summarizes the user preference results.\\nOverall, FunHSI is strongly preferred over the baseline methods across all evaluation settings.\\nWhen taking GenHSI as a representative baseline, FunHSI achieves an overall preference rate of 71.1%.\\nWhen evaluated separately, FunHSI obtains a preference rate of 76.8% for functional HSI and 66.0% for general HSI, indicating a clear advantage in scenarios that require functional reasoning and affordance-aware interaction.\\nMoreover, the preference margins are more pronounced in functional HSI, indicating that users are particularly sensitive to correct functional grounding and realistic contact with task-relevant elements.\\nThese results demonstrate that FunHSI not only improves quantitative metrics, but also produces perceptually more convincing human\\u2013scene interactions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMethod\\nNCS \\u2191\\\\uparrow\\nN-FCD \\u2193\\\\downarrow\\nFCD

physically implausible interactions (red).\\nBy swapping left-right hand to align with the observed contacting hand in the image, our method produces correct and stable human-scene interactions (green).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3 Ablation Studies\\n\\nContact graph refinement.\\n\\nWe ablate the contact graph refinement module by directly using the initial contact graph predicted by the LLM, without aligning left-right relations to the inpainting image.\\nAs shown in Table\\u00a02 and Fig.\\u00a09, removing this refinement leads to degraded contact accuracy, particularly for supporting elements such as the floor, while only marginally affecting the functional distance.\\nThis behavior indicates that ambiguities in left-right correspondence between the contact graph and the generated image can cause failures in the body fitting stage, highlighting the importance of contact graph refinement for stable and accurate interactions.\\n\\n\\n\\nBody & hand pose estimation.\\n\\nWe evaluate the importance of body and hand pose estimation by removing this module from our pipeline and initializing the SMPL-X body with a T-pose prior to refinement.\\nAs shown in Table\\u00a02 and Fig.\\u00a010, this modification leads to consistent degradation across all metrics.\\nThis observation indicates that accurate body and hand pose estimation from the inpainted image plays a critical role in guiding the optimization.\\n\\n\\nFigure 10: Effect of body and hand pose initialization.\\nBody and hand pose initialization provides a consistent starting point, enabling correct hand placement and stable refinement for functional interactions.\\n\\n\\n\\nBody refinement.\\n\\nWe ablate the body refinement stage by directly using the estimated SMPL-X pose without further optimization.\\nAs shown in Table\\u00a02, this results in increased body-scene penetration and less realistic contacts, indicating that the initial pose alone is insufficient to resolve geometric inconsistencies.\\nThese results confirm the necessity of body refinement for producing physically plausible and functionally correct HSI.\\n\\n\\n\\nFunctional element detection.\\n\\nTo evaluate the impact of detection accuracy, we replace the predicted functional element masks with ground-truth annotations (i.e., oracle detection).\\nAs reported in Table\\u00a02, oracle detection leads to a noticeable reduction in functional contact distance (from 0.2968 to 0.2662) while preserving comparable non-collision performance.\\nThis improvement suggests that our generation framework can directly benefit from more robust upstream detection modules.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"5 Conclusion\": \"\\n\\n5 Conclusion\\n\\nIn this work, we studied the problem of functional human-scene interaction synthesis, where a human must reason about object functionality and establish appropriate physical contact to accomplish an open-vocabulary task in a novel 3D scene.\\nWe proposed FunHSI, a training-free and functionality-driven framework that generates 3D human-scene interactions from posed RGB-D observations and open-vocabulary task prompts, without relying on explicit action-object descriptions.\\nBy integrating functionality-aware contact graph reasoning, human initialization, and optimization-based body refinement, FunHSI bridges high-level task intent and physically plausible interaction.\\nExtensive evaluations on a benchmark derived from SceneFun3D show that FunHSI consistently outperforms existing baselines, particularly for functional interactions, while maintaining strong physical plausibility.\\nWe believe FunHSI represents a step toward more semantically grounded human-scene interaction synthesis and opens up future directions for long-horizon and real-world embodied interaction.\\n\\n\\nLimitations and future work.\\n\\nOur method currently focuses on single-step functional human-scene interactions, where a single human pose is synthesized to accomplish a given task.\\nAs a result, it does not explicitly model long-horizon or multi-step interactions that require sequential planning or temporal reasoning across multiple actions (e.g., opening a door and then walking through it).\\nExtending FunHSI to support temporally coherent, multi-step functional interactions remains an interesting direction for future work.\\nIn addition, the scales of city scenes are estimated from RGB images. Unifying the body and the scene scales is also a future work.\\n\\n\\n\", \"Acknowledgement\": \"\\nAcknowledgement\\n\\nWe sincerely thank Alexandros Delitzas and Francis Engelmann for the guidance on SceneFun3D, Priyanka Patel on the guidance of CameraHMR, Muhammed Kocabas for fruitful discussions on foundation models.\\nWe also sincerely thank Nitin Saini and Nathan Bajandas for kind help and explorations on Unreal Engine.

executable contact reasoning, we annotate the SMPL-X body surface using a hierarchical part decomposition.\\nAt the coarse level, we partition the body surface into 15 semantic parts following the SMPL-X template\\u00a0[27]:\\nhead, left upper arm, right upper arm, left forearm, right forearm,\\nleft hand, right hand, back, buttocks,\\nleft thigh, right thigh, left calf, right calf, left foot, and right foot,\\nas illustrated in Fig.\\u00a011.\\nEach part corresponds to a fixed subset of vertices on the SMPL-X mesh, yielding consistent semantic labeling across different poses and body shapes.\\nSince functional interactions in indoor environments are primarily performed by the hands and often involve small-scale objects (e.g., knobs, switches, dials), we further introduce a fine-grained hand annotation.\\nSpecifically, each hand is subdivided into six sub-parts: one palm and five fingers.\\nEach sub-part is associated with a predefined vertex set on the SMPL-X mesh, as shown in Fig.\\u00a011.\\nThis design allows the representation of both whole-hand contacts (e.g., palm-handle) and finger-level functional interactions (e.g., index finger-button) without introducing unnecessary anatomical complexity.\\nThis hierarchical annotation plays a dual role in our pipeline.\\nFirst, it provides a structured and semantically grounded vocabulary for LLM-based contact graph reasoning, enabling the model to express contacts using interpretable body-part names (e.g., \\u201cleft index finger touches the switch\\u201d).\\nSecond, it establishes a direct mapping from contact semantics to geometric constraints: each contact node bb in the contact graph is mapped to its corresponding vertex set \\ud835\\udcb1b\\\\mathcal{V}_{b}, which is used to compute contact losses during body refinement.\\nBy grounding language-level contact reasoning in mesh-level geometry, this annotation enables precise functional interactions while maintaining physical plausibility.\\n\\n\", \"Appendix B Datasets Details\": \"\\n\\nAppendix B Datasets Details\\n\\nIndoor scenes from SceneFun3D\\u00a0[4].\\n\\nTo systematically evaluate both prior methods and our approach for human-scene interaction (HSI) synthesis under fair and controlled settings, we construct a new benchmark derived from the SceneFun3D dataset.\\nWe select 30 indoor scenes covering diverse spatial layouts and functional contexts, including living rooms, bedrooms, kitchens, and bathrooms.\\nAll scenes contain common household objects that afford human interaction, such as doors, drawers, cabinets, switches, radiators, and supporting furniture.\\nFor each scene, we provide three canonical RGB-D views captured from different viewpoints, where each view consists of an RGB image, a depth image, and pixel-level mask annotations for key affordance-bearing elements (e.g., door handles, knobs, floors, and supporting surfaces).\\nUsing known camera parameters, the three views are back-projected and fused into a unified 3D point cloud, which serves as the geometric input for all interaction synthesis methods.\\nFor each scene, we manually define two types of interaction settings: functional human-scene interaction (functional HSI) and non-functional human-scene interaction (general HSI).\\nFunctional HSI requires the human to interact with a specific functional element to accomplish a task objective (e.g., open the door, adjust the room temperature, dial a number on the telephone), while non-functional HSI involves generic body-scene interactions that do not rely on object functionality (e.g., sit on the floor, stand in front of the window).\\nEach interaction setting is paired with a single text prompt per scene, resulting in a total of 60 curated interaction tasks (30 functional and 30 non-functional).\\nThe functional interaction prompts are designed to cover a diverse range of manipulation affordances, including pinch_pull, hook_pull, tip_push, rotate, plug_in, unplug, and key_press.\\nMost tasks involve fine-grained hand-object interactions, intentionally emphasizing functional reasoning and precise contact modeling rather than coarse body placement alone.\\nAll methods are evaluated on the same set of scenes, views, and text prompts without additional training or scene-specific tuning.\\nThe reconstructed scene geometry and affordance annotations are reused across different interaction prompts within each scene to ensure consistent and fair comparison.\\n\\n\\n\\nReal-world city scenes.\\n\\nTo evaluate the generalization ability of FunHSI under open-world conditions, we additionally collect a set of real-world city scenes captured in public environments.\\nAll data are captured using an iPhone 14 Pro Max. For each scene, we take multiple RGB images from different viewpoints. We use GeoCalib\\u00a0[36] to estimate the camera intrinsic parameters and the gravity direction, and use MapAnything\\u00a0[15] to estimate the camera poses, the depth maps, and the 3D scene point cloud.\\n\\n\\nThe collected scenes include diverse outdoor and semi-outdoor environments such as building entrances, staircases, ticket machines, escalators, benches, and public facilities, featuring challenging factors including clutter, reflective surfaces, varying illumination, and unconstrained object layouts.\\nWe apply the same processing pipeline as in indoor scenes without any scene-specific tuning.\\nThis experimental setting allows us to assess whether FunHSI can generalize beyond curated indoor datasets and reliably synthesize function-aware human-scene interactions in real-world, unconstrained environments.\\n\\n\\n\", \"Appendix C Implementation Details\": \"\\n\\nAppendix C Implementation Details\\n\\nAll our experiments are conducted on a single NVIDIA A6000

graph generation.\\nAll vision-language model queries are performed in a zero-shot manner, without task-specific fine-tuning.\\nScene reconstruction is performed by back-projecting three posed RGB-D views into a unified point cloud using known camera parameters.\\nFunctional and supporting elements are segmented using SAM-ViT-H and lifted into 3D.\\nThe reconstructed scene geometry and functional element annotations are cached and reused across different interaction prompts within the same scene.\\nHuman body initialization is obtained via image-space human inpainting using Gemini.\\nTo reduce

FunHSI on real-world scenes captured in public environments.\\nThese scenes exhibit significantly higher visual and geometric complexity than indoor datasets, including cluttered backgrounds, irregular lighting conditions, reflective surfaces, and diverse object appearances.\\nGiven three posed RGB-D views and a task-level text prompt, FunHSI successfully synthesizes functionally appropriate human-scene interactions without scene-specific tuning.\\nAs shown in the figure, our method correctly identifies task-relevant functional elements and generates plausible interactions for a wide range of actions, such as taking escalators or elevators, buying tickets from vending machines, opening doors, pinning objects to a whiteboard, and interacting with urban furniture.\\nThese results demonstrate that FunHSI generalizes beyond curated indoor datasets and is capable of handling open-world scenes while preserving functional grounding, contact correctness, and physical plausibility.\\n\\n\\n\\nGeneration Diversity.\\n\\nFig.\\u00a013 illustrates the diversity of human-scene interactions generated by FunHSI under the same scene and task prompt.\\nFor each example, we visualize multiple valid 3D human poses that differ in body configuration, viewpoint, and spatial arrangement, while consistently preserving the intended functional contact.\\nSpecifically, FunHSI produces diverse interaction realizations for tasks such as opening a drawer, dialing a telephone, and opening a door, all of which maintain correct contact with the task-relevant functional elements.\\nThese variations arise from differences in initial image synthesis and subsequent geometric refinement, rather than changes in task specification.\\nThis result demonstrates that FunHSI does not collapse to a single canonical pose, but instead supports diverse yet functionally consistent human-scene interaction generation.\\n\\n\\n\\nHuman Inpainting Examples.\\n\\nFig.\\u00a03 presents representative examples of task-conditioned human inpainting in our pipeline.\\nGiven an input RGB image and a task-level functional prompt, the inpainting model synthesizes a human that is spatially consistent with the scene layout and roughly aligned with the intended interaction region.\\nImportantly, the inpainted humans already reflect coarse functional intent (e.g., reaching, crouching, or bending), providing a semantically meaningful and visually grounded initialization that reduces ambiguity in subsequent 3D reconstruction.\\n\\n\\n\\nBody and Hand Pose Estimation Examples.\\n\\nBased on the inpainted images in Fig.\\u00a03, we estimate the initial 3D SMPL-X body pose together with articulated hand poses.\\nThe estimated poses capture coarse body configuration and hand-object alignment in image space, including which hand is used and its approximate contact location.\\nThese estimates serve as strong initialization for our geometry-aware body refinement, significantly improving optimization stability, accelerating convergence, and reducing failure cases such as incorrect hand assignment or implausible body configurations.\\n\\n\\nFigure 15: \\nLayout

Recent systems  (lu2024aiscientist; yamada2025aiscientistv2; gottweis_towards_2025) demonstrate that LLM-based agents can autonomously execute an end-to-end research loop, including literature review, code generation, experiment execution, and manuscript drafting. These results suggest that automated scientific discovery is becoming practically feasible and that LLM-based agents are approaching a level of functional completeness required for autonomous research (jin_agentreview_2024; sahu_reviewertoo_2025; ajith2024litsearch; zhang_noveltybench_2025; zhang2026opennovelty).\\n\\n\\nDespite this progress, existing systems remain constrained by a fundamental inefficiency in their execution paradigm, which limits their scalability and robustness in practice. In particular, most current research agents (wang_openhands_2025; yang_swe-agent_2024; mitchener_kosmos_2025; luo2025llm4sr) rely on an on-the-spot computation strategy, where nearly all information acquisition, reasoning, and synthesis are performed online at runtime. Under this paradigm, each new research attempt requires the agent to dynamically retrieve large volumes of scientific literature, read and summarize long and heterogeneous documents in real time, and explore a broad space of candidate methods and experimental designs through open-ended generation and trial-and-error. As a result, the cost of producing a single effective scientific discovery remains substantial. For example, a complete execution of the overall pipeline often requires several hours and, in some cases, up to 15 hours to progress from ideation to experimentation (lu2024aiscientist). Similarly, in (schmidgall_agent_2025), literature review and experimental planning alone account for a significant portion of total inference time and place heavy demands on the language model\\u2019s ability to maintain coherent reasoning over long contexts. More importantly, this runtime-centric design repeatedly forces the model to re-process large volumes of unstructured and partially redundant information, even when much of the underlying scientific knowledge is already well established, thereby increasing computational overhead and exacerbating the risk of hallucination and reasoning errors (wang2025repomaster; shin_mind_2025).\\n\\n\\nTo address the efficiency and reliability limitations of existing autonomous research agents, we propose Idea2Story, a scientific discovery framework that explicitly separates offline knowledge construction from online research generation, with the goal of reducing repeated reasoning over scientific literature and alleviating the context window bottleneck of large language models. Most current systems rely on runtime-centric execution, where agents repeatedly retrieve, read, summarize, and reason over large collections of highly overlapping papers for each new research attempt, resulting in substantial computational cost and prolonged execution time. Idea2Story mitigates this inefficiency by shifting literature understanding from online reasoning to an offline stage. In the offline phase, the system periodically collects recently accepted, peer-reviewed papers together with their full review feedback, extracts core methodological units and research patterns, and organizes these units and their observed composition relations into a continuously updated structured knowledge graph. This knowledge graph serves as a compact and reusable representation of established scientific methods and their empirical compatibility, replacing repeated processing of raw documents at runtime. Building on this offline knowledge infrastructure, Idea2Story performs online research generation by aligning underspecified user research intents with existing research paradigms encoded in the knowledge graph. Rather than relying on open-ended generation and trial-and-error, the system retrieves high-quality research patterns as structured compositions of method units, which act as stable methodological blueprints for downstream experimental design and execution. Guided by these validated research patterns, Idea2Story conducts feasibility-driven experimentation and ultimately generates a complete, submission-ready paper in an end-to-end manner.\\n\\n\\nFigure 1:  Overview of the two-stage framework in Idea2Story. The offline stage constructs a structured knowledge graph by extracting and organizing reusable method units from a curated paper corpus. The online stage retrieves and composes research patterns from the knowledge graph to ground underspecified user intent into concrete and coherent research directions.\\n\\n\\nOur work makes the following contributions to autonomous scientific discovery :\\n(1) We introduce Idea2Story, a framework that formalizes autonomous research as a\\npre-computation\\u2013driven process, where scientific knowledge is extracted, structured, and\\nmaintained in a continuously updated methodological knowledge graph, addressing the inefficiency and\\nunreliability of runtime-centric research agents. (2) We propose a knowledge-grounded planning and execution pipeline that alleviates the context window bottleneck and reduces repeated runtime reasoning over literature by converting paper reading into retrieval over a pre-built knowledge graph. (3) We conduct preliminary empirical studies and comparative evaluations, demonstrating that Idea2Story can produce several high-quality research demos and establishing the practical feasibility of the proposed paradigm in an end-to-end setting.\\n\\n\", \"2 Related Work\": \"\\n\\n2 Related Work\\n\\n\\n2.1 Autonomous Scientific Discovery\\n\\nRecent advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven growing interest in autonomous scientific\\ndiscovery agents that aim to automate the full research lifecycle, from code generation to experimental\\nexecution  (hu_controlled_2026; zhang2025evolving; lin_se-agent_2025). Early systems such as The AI Scientist (v1) (lu2024aiscientist) demonstrate the\\nviability of end-to-end automation but rely heavily on manually crafted code templates and largely\\nlinear exploration workflows, which restrict discovery depth and adaptability. Later approaches, including\\nThe AI Scientist-v2 (yamada2025aiscientistv2) and Kosmos (mitchener_kosmos_2025), reduce reliance on\\nexplicit template through the incorporation of agentic tree search and experiment management agents, enabling iterative and multi-round exploration.\\n\\n\\nIn research ideation, LLM-generated ideas are often perceived as highly novel during initial screening; however, prior studies (si2024can) uncover a critical paradox whereby such ideas tend to underperform after implementation relative to human-generated ideas, indicating limited feasibility and practical\\nutility. As more ideas are generated, LLM outputs exhibit growing similarity, leading to diminished meaningful diversity. Similar limitations have also been observed in research evaluation and peer\\nreview (liang2024can; xu2025can; thakkar_can_2025; zhang2026opennovelty). Existing AI-based reviewers display systematic blind\\nspots: shin_mind_2025 shows that LLM reviewers place disproportionate\\nemphasis on technical correctness while undervaluing novelty, deviating from human\\nexpert judgment, while sahu_reviewertoo_2025 demonstrates that AI reviewers\\nstruggle to distinguish fine-grained acceptance categories and are susceptible to sycophancy, with\\nreview scores increasing unreasonably after exposure to author rebuttals. Although recent approaches\\nsuch as AgentReview (jin_agentreview_2024) seek to mitigate these deficiencies by simulating\\ndiverse reviewer roles, automated evaluation systems remain less reliable than human experts in\\nidentifying robust accept/reject decision boundaries.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2.2 LLM-Driven Agents\\n\\nLLM-driven agents still struggle to interact effectively with complex real-world environments.\\nDespite their strong generative capabilities, many existing systems\\u2014such as OpenHands (wang_openhands_2025)\\nand SWE-Agent (yang_swe-agent_2024)\\u2014exhibit limited performance when applied to realistic\\ncodebases. These limitations largely stem from insufficient reasoning over hierarchical dependencies\\nand structural constraints, as well as the inherent restrictions imposed by finite context windows.\\nAs a result, LLM-driven agents achieve relatively low task completion rates on challenging benchmarks\\nsuch as MLE-bench (chan_mlebench_2024) and SciCode (tian_scicode_2024).\\nRepoMaster (wang2025repomaster) further identifies inadequate modeling of codebase structure,\\nincluding function call graphs and module dependency graphs, as a key bottleneck for LLM-driven agents\\noperating in large and complex environments.\\n\\n\\nBeyond execution limitations, LLM-driven agents also exhibit notable deficiencies in scientific rigor\\nand evaluative judgment. When tasked with autonomous assessment, these agents are prone to hallucination and overconfidence. For instance, Agent Laboratory (schmidgall_agent_2025) reports that automated evaluations produced by LLM-driven agents substantially overestimate paper quality compared to human reviewers. Evaluations of Kosmos (mitchener_kosmos_2025) further reveal a tendency to invent opaque quantitative metrics and to conflate statistical significance with scientific value, leading to weak interpretability of experimental conclusions. Moreover, long-horizon autonomous execution exacerbates these issues by introducing behavioral\\ndrift (arike2025tech), where LLM-driven agents gradually deviate from intended research trajectories or generate overly strong and insufficiently justified claims (lu2024aiscientist; schmidgall2025agent; baek_researchagent_2025; hong_metagpt_2023; wu_autogen_2023; lin_se-agent_2025; hu_controlled_2026). This drift further undermines reliability and highlights the\\nneed for stronger structural grounding and validation mechanisms in LLM-based autonomous research\\nsystems.\\n\\n\\n\", \"3 General Idea Generation\": \"\\n\\n3 General Idea Generation\\n\\nIdea2Story is designed to interact with users through high-level and often informal research ideas\\nthat reflect human intuition rather than fully specified technical plans. The system transforms\\nsuch underspecified inputs into structured and academically grounded research directions through\\na two-stage paradigm that separates offline knowledge construction from online research generation:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nOffline Knowledge Construction.\\nIn the offline stage, Idea2Story builds a reusable methodological foundation from existing\\nscientific literature. This includes curating a large-scale paper pool from peer-reviewed\\nvenues, extracting reusable method units that capture core methodological contributions, and\\norganizing these units into a structured knowledge graph that encodes their semantic and\\ncompositional relations. The resulting knowledge graph serves as a persistent repository of\\nmethodological abstractions, decoupling literature understanding from runtime reasoning.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nOnline Research Generation.\\nIn the online stage, Idea2Story grounds user-provided research ideas through retrieval and\\ncomposition over the pre-built knowledge graph. Given an informal user idea, the system aligns\\nthe input with existing research paradigms, retrieves relevant research patterns, and composes\\ncompatible method units into concrete research directions. These instantiated patterns are\\nfurther refined through a review-guided process that iteratively evaluates and revises them with\\nrespect to novelty, methodological soundness, and conceptual coherence. The refined research\\npatterns then serve as structured blueprints for subsequent planning, feasibility-driven\\nexperimentation, and end-to-end paper generation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1 Offline Knowledge Construction\\n\\nThe offline knowledge construction stage aims to distill reusable methodological structure from\\nexisting scientific literature and to organize it in a form that can be efficiently accessed during\\nonline research generation. Instead of performing document-level reasoning at runtime, Idea2Story\\npre-computes a structured representation of prior work that captures both methodological\\nabstractions and their observed compatibility in accepted research. This stage consists of three\\nmain components: (i) constructing a curated paper pool from peer-reviewed venues, (ii) extracting\\ncore method units that represent reusable methodological contributions, and (iii) organizing these\\nunits and their composition relations into a structured knowledge graph. Together, these components\\nform a persistent methodological memory that decouples literature understanding from downstream\\nidea grounding and research generation.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1.1 Paper Pool Construction\\n\\nWe construct a paper pool from accepted machine learning papers and their associated peer reviews\\ncollected from top-tier conferences.

Formally, we model method unit extraction as a mapping\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2130:p~\\u2192\\ud835\\udcb0p={up(1),\\u2026,up(Kp)},\\\\mathcal{E}:\\\\tilde{p}\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathcal{U}_{p}=\\\\{u_{p}^{(1)},\\\\dots,u_{p}^{(K_{p})}\\\\},\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere p~\\u2208\\ud835\\udcab~\\\\tilde{p}\\\\in\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}} denotes a single paper and \\ud835\\udcb0p\\\\mathcal{U}_{p} is a small set\\nof method units that capture its essential technical ideas.\\n\\n\\nAs illustrated in Figure 2, the extraction procedure leverages the standardized structure of\\nacademic papers and analyzes different sections to collect complementary methodological signals.\\nLet \\ud835\\udc31p=(introp,methodp,expp)\\\\mathbf{x}_{p}=(\\\\text{intro}_{p},\\\\text{method}_{p},\\\\text{exp}_{p}) denote the partition of a paper\\ninto its introduction, method, and experiments sections. The introduction is used to identify the\\nhigh-level research motivation and the precise problem formulation, the method section provides\\nsignals about core technical mechanisms such as modeling assumptions, learning objectives, model\\narchitectures, and optimization strategies, and the experiments section reflects how these\\nmechanisms are instantiated and evaluated in practice. By jointly aggregating information from\\nthese sections, the extractor isolates method units that correspond to the primary algorithmic or\\nmodeling contributions of the paper, rather than surface-level experimental details.\\n\\n\\nWe define a method unit u\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb0pu\\\\in\\\\mathcal{U}_{p} as a self-contained description of how a research\\nproblem is formulated or solved, abstracted away from specific implementation choices and\\nexperimental configurations. Elements that primarily involve dataset selection, hyperparameter\\ntuning, or engineering-level optimizations are excluded unless they induce substantive changes to\\nthe problem formulation, model structure, or learning objective. In practice, most papers yield one\\nor a small number of method units. Each extracted unit is further normalized into structured\\nmethodological attributes, including atomic meta-methods, which correspond to indivisible\\nmethodological elements, and composition-level patterns, which describe how multiple method\\nunits are combined within a single paper.\\n\\n\\nAfter extracting method units for all papers, we represent each paper p\\u2208\\ud835\\udcab~p\\\\in\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}}\\nby a vector embedding derived from its associated method units. Formally, let\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc33p=g\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb0p),\\\\mathbf{z}_{p}=g(\\\\mathcal{U}_{p}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udcb0p\\\\mathcal{U}_{p} denotes the set of extracted method units for paper pp and\\ng\\u200b(\\u22c5)g(\\\\cdot) is an embedding function that maps a set of method units to a fixed-dimensional\\nrepresentation.\\n\\n\\nTo induce higher-level research patterns, we first apply a nonlinear dimensionality reduction\\noperator\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc32p=UMAP\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc33p),\\\\mathbf{y}_{p}=\\\\mathrm{UMAP}(\\\\mathbf{z}_{p}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhich projects the high-dimensional embeddings into a lower-dimensional space while preserving\\nlocal semantic neighborhoods. We then perform density-based clustering on the reduced\\nrepresentations using DBSCAN, yielding a partition\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9e={C1,\\u2026,CM},\\\\mathcal{C}=\\\\{C_{1},\\\\dots,C_{M}\\\\},\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere each cluster Cm\\u2282\\ud835\\udcab~C_{m}\\\\subset\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}} corresponds to a coherent research pattern.\\n\\n\\nThese induced clusters serve as higher-level abstractions over individual papers, capturing\\nrecurring methodological structures that are reused across the literature. The resulting research\\npatterns form the basis for subsequent retrieval and composition.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2:  Offline knowledge graph construction in Idea2Story. Academic papers and their associated review artifacts are first anonymized and safety-filtered, then deconstructed into layered methodological representations. These layers capture complementary aspects of a paper, including its core research idea, domain context, high-level story skeleton, and packaging actions. The extracted elements are normalized into atomic method units and meta-methods, which are connected through composition and similarity relations. Reviewer feedback is incorporated as additional signals to refine relations and validate abstractions. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1.3 Knowledge Graph Construction\\n\\nBuilding on the extracted method units, we organize reusable methodological components into a\\nstructured knowledge graph that supports systematic method discovery and composition. While\\nindividual method units capture isolated algorithmic or modeling ideas, effective research methods\\nin practice typically arise from structured combinations of multiple method units. The knowledge\\ngraph provides a unified representation that explicitly encodes canonicalized method units,\\nmeta-methods, and their empirically observed composition relations in prior work.\\n\\n\\nFormally, we define the knowledge graph as a directed graph\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udca2=(\\ud835\\udcb1,\\u2130),\\\\mathcal{G}=(\\\\mathcal{V},\\\\mathcal{E}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere each node v\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb1v\\\\in\\\\mathcal{V} corresponds to a canonicalized method unit or a meta-method.\\nCanonicalization groups semantically similar method units across the corpus into shared\\nmeta-method abstractions, reducing surface-level variation while preserving core methodological\\nintent. As a result, nodes in the graph represent atomic or minimally indivisible methodological\\nelements that are reused across papers.\\n\\n\\nEdges in the graph encode composition relations between method units. For a given paper\\np\\u2208\\ud835\\udcab~p\\\\in\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}} with extracted method unit set \\ud835\\udcb0p\\\\mathcal{U}_{p}, we add directed edges\\nbetween pairs of method units (ui,uj)\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb0p\\u00d7\\ud835\\udcb0p(u_{i},u_{j})\\\\in\\\\mathcal{U}_{p}\\\\times\\\\mathcal{U}_{p} to indicate that\\nthey are jointly instantiated as part of the same methodological pipeline. These edges capture\\nempirical evidence of method compatibility observed in prior work, reflecting how different\\nmethod units are combined in practice rather than hypothetical or manually specified relations.\\n\\n\\nAggregating composition relations across the full corpus yields a graph structure that encodes both\\nmethodological abstraction and empirical compatibility. In particular, the graph captures two\\ncomplementary levels of structure: (i) reusable methodological elements represented as\\ncanonicalized method units and meta-methods, and (ii) composition constraints induced from\\nco-occurrence statistics in accepted papers. This separation allows Idea2Story to reason about\\nmethods at a higher level of abstraction than individual papers, while remaining grounded in\\nobserved research practice.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2 Online Research Generation.\\n\\nGiven a target research objective, Idea2Story treats method discovery as a graph-based retrieval and\\ncomposition problem over \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G}. The system retrieves relevant subgraphs and composes\\ncompatible method units by following connectivity constraints in the graph, producing candidate\\nresearch patterns that correspond to structured combinations of method units. These research\\npatterns serve as high-level methodological blueprints that bridge abstract research intent and\\nconcrete experimental design, enabling downstream planning, feasibility analysis, and end-to-end\\npaper generation.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2.1 Research Pattern Retrieval\\n\\nGiven a user-provided research idea expressed in natural language, we formulate research pattern\\nidentification as a structured retrieval problem over the knowledge graph \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G}. Let\\nqq denote the input research idea, and let \\ud835\\udc9e={C1,\\u2026,CM}\\\\mathcal{C}=\\\\{C_{1},\\\\dots,C_{M}\\\\} denote the set of\\nresearch patterns induced from the paper corpus. The goal is to rank patterns in \\ud835\\udc9e\\\\mathcal{C}\\naccording to their relevance to qq.\\n\\n\\nRather than relying on a single similarity metric, Idea2Story adopts a multi-view retrieval\\nformulation that aggregates complementary signals from different semantic abstractions. Formally,\\nfor each research pattern CmC_{m}, we compute a relevance score\\n\\n\\n\\ns\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)=\\u2211v\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb1\\u03bbv\\u200bsv\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q),s(C_{m}\\\\mid q)=\\\\sum_{v\\\\in\\\\mathcal{V}}\\\\lambda_{v}\\\\,s_{v}(C_{m}\\\\mid q),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udcb1={idea,domain,paper}\\\\mathcal{V}=\\\\{\\\\text{idea},\\\\text{domain},\\\\text{paper}\\\\} indexes the retrieval views,\\nsv\\u200b(\\u22c5)s_{v}(\\\\cdot) denotes a view-specific scoring function, and \\u03bbv\\\\lambda_{v} are fixed weighting\\ncoefficients that balance the contribution of different views.\\n\\n\\nIdea-level retrieval.\\n\\nAt the idea level, the system retrieves previously observed research ideas that are semantically\\nsimilar to the input query qq. Let \\u2110\\\\mathcal{I} denote the set of stored research ideas extracted\\nfrom the corpus, and let simidea\\u200b(q,i)\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{idea}}(q,i) denote a semantic similarity function\\nbetween qq and an idea i\\u2208\\u2110i\\\\in\\\\mathcal{I}. The idea-level score of a research pattern CmC_{m} is\\ncomputed by aggregating the similarity scores of ideas associated with the pattern:\\n\\n\\n\\nsidea\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)=maxi\\u2208\\u2110\\u200b(Cm)\\u2061simidea\\u200b(q,i),s_{\\\\text{idea}}(C_{m}\\\\mid q)=\\\\max_{i\\\\in\\\\mathcal{I}(C_{m})}\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{idea}}(q,i),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u2110\\u200b(Cm)\\\\mathcal{I}(C_{m}) denotes the set of ideas linked to pattern CmC_{m}.\\n\\n\\n\\nDomain-level retrieval.\\n\\nAt the domain level, the system interprets the input idea qq in terms of its underlying research\\ndomains and methodological themes. Let \\ud835\\udc9f\\\\mathcal{D} denote the set of research domains, and let\\nsimdomain\\u200b(q,d)\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{domain}}(q,d) measure the relevance between qq and domain d\\u2208\\ud835\\udc9fd\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}.\\nThe domain-level score of pattern CmC_{m} is computed as\\n\\n\\n\\nsdomain\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)=\\u2211d\\u2208\\ud835\\udc9f\\u200b(Cm)simdomain\\u200b(q,d)\\u200bw\\u200b(d,Cm),s_{\\\\text{domain}}(C_{m}\\\\mid q)=\\\\sum_{d\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}(C_{m})}\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{domain}}(q,d)\\\\,w(d,C_{m}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udc9f\\u200b(Cm)\\\\mathcal{D}(C_{m}) denotes the domains associated with pattern CmC_{m}, and w\\u200b(d,Cm)w(d,C_{m}) captures\\nempirical effectiveness signals derived from the knowledge graph.\\n\\n\\n\\nPaper-level retrieval.\\n\\nAt the paper level, the system retrieves papers whose technical content is semantically aligned\\nwith the input idea. Let \\ud835\\udcab\\u200b(Cm)\\\\mathcal{P}(C_{m}) denote the set of papers instantiating pattern CmC_{m}.\\nThe paper-level score is computed as\\n\\n\\n\\nspaper\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)=maxp\\u2208\\ud835\\udcab\\u200b(Cm)\\u2061simpaper\\u200b(q,p)\\u22c5\\u03b1\\u200b(p),s_{\\\\text{paper}}(C_{m}\\\\mid q)=\\\\max_{p\\\\in\\\\mathcal{P}(C_{m})}\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{paper}}(q,p)\\\\cdot\\\\alpha(p),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere simpaper\\u200b(q,p)\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{paper}}(q,p) measures semantic similarity between qq and paper pp,\\nand \\u03b1\\u200b(p)\\\\alpha(p) denotes a quality-related weight derived from peer review metadata.\\n\\n\\nThe final ranked list of research patterns is obtained by ordering patterns according to their\\naggregated multi-view relevance scores. Formally, we define\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9e\\u2217\\u200b(q)=RankCm\\u2208\\ud835\\udc9e\\u2061(\\u2211v\\u2208{idea,domain,paper}\\u03bbv\\u200bsv\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)),\\\\mathcal{C}^{*}(q)=\\\\operatorname{Rank}_{C_{m}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{C}}\\\\left(\\\\sum_{v\\\\in\\\\{\\\\text{idea},\\\\text{domain},\\\\text{paper}\\\\}}\\\\lambda_{v}\\\\,s_{v}(C_{m}\\\\mid q)\\\\right),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere patterns are sorted in descending order of the aggregated score.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2.2 Review-Guided Refinement\\n\\nAfter candidate research patterns are retrieved, Idea2Story refines them using an explicit\\nLLM-based review loop. In each iteration, a large language model is prompted to act as a reviewer\\nand evaluate the current research pattern along several predefined criteria, including technical\\nsoundness, novelty with respect to existing literature, and overall clarity of the problem\\u2013method\\nalignment. The reviewer produces both scalar judgments and concrete revision suggestions.\\n\\n\\nThe system then uses this feedback to update the research pattern in a targeted manner. When the\\nreview indicates insufficient novelty, the system modifies the pattern by recombining compatible\\nmethod units or introducing alternative realizations within the same pattern family. When the\\nreview identifies issues in feasibility or ambiguity in formulation, the system revises the problem\\ndefinition or method structure to improve consistency and executability. Each revised pattern is\\nre-submitted to the same review process, forming an explicit generate\\u2013review\\u2013revise loop.\\n\\n\\nTo prevent uncontrolled drift, only revisions that improve the reviewer scores are retained;\\notherwise, the system rolls back to the previous version. This process repeats until the reviewer\\njudges the pattern to be sufficiently novel, coherent, and technically plausible, or until further\\niterations no longer yield improvement. The output of this stage is a refined research pattern that\\nhas been iteratively vetted by an LLM-based reviewer and is suitable for downstream validation and\\npaper generation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"4 Experiments and Analysis\": \"\\n\\n4 Experiments and Analysis\\n\\nWe evaluate Idea2Story through a set of experiments focusing on its ability to extract reusable\\nmethodological structure and to generate high-quality research patterns from ambiguous user input.\\nOur experiments are conducted on a corpus of accepted papers from ICLR and NeurIPS over the past\\nthree years, including approximately 13K papers and their associated peer reviews, which serves as\\nthe foundation for all subsequent analyses. Based on this corpus, we first analyze the properties of the extracted method units to assess whether Idea2Story captures meaningful and reusable methodological abstractions. We then present qualitative demonstrations of research patterns instantiated as structured research stories, illustrating how the system transforms vague research intent into coherent and methodologically grounded research directions.\\n\\n\\n\\nCase 1: Method Unit Extraction Demo\\n\\n\\nPaper Title:\\nLearning Dynamics of LLM Finetuning\\nBase Problem:\\nUnderstanding how specific training examples influence model predictions during finetuning is challenging, particularly in large language models.\\nSolution Pattern:\\nDevelop a framework to analyze step-wise influence accumulation among potential responses during finetuning, providing insights into phenomena like hallucination and the squeezing effect in off-policy direct preference optimization.\\nStory:\\nReframe the understanding of LLM finetuning through the lens of learning dynamics, offering a unified interpretation of training behaviors and inspiring methods to enhance model alignment and performance.\\nApplication:\\nImproving alignment in large language models, enhancing finetuning strategies for better model performance, diagnosing and mitigating hallucination in AI systems.\\n\\nFigure 3: An example of a method unit extracted from an accepted paper, illustrating the separation of the base problem, solution pattern, and higher-level research story.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.1 Implementation Details\\n\\nTo further assess the effectiveness of Idea2Story in practical research ideation settings, we\\nconduct additional qualitative experiments on a small set of representative cases. Specifically,\\nwe evaluate three user-provided research ideas curated by an external collaborator. For each case,\\nIdea2Story generates research patterns using the GLM-4.7 (zeng2025glm) model as the underlying language backbone. As a baseline, we compare against direct LLM generation, where the same model is prompted to produce a complete research story without explicit pattern modeling or retrieval.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.2 Case Study: Method Unit Extraction\\n\\nWe present a representative case study to illustrate the behavior of the proposed method unit\\nextraction agent. Case 1 shows an example extracted from an accepted paper, where the system decomposes the full paper into a structured set of methodological elements.\\n\\n\\nAs shown in the example, the extracted method unit explicitly separates the underlying research\\nproblem, the core solution pattern, and the resulting research story. The Base Problem describes the core challenge addressed by the paper, namely understanding how individual training examples influence model behavior during finetuning, without depending on specific datasets or implementation details. The Solution Pattern summarizes the central methodological idea as\\nan analysis framework for step-wise influence accumulation, highlighting the key mechanism without\\nbinding it to a particular optimization setup or experimental configuration. Importantly, the extracted Story reframes the technical contribution at a higher level of\\nabstraction, connecting learning dynamics to broader phenomena such as hallucination and alignment\\nin large language models. This abstraction reflects how the method unit goes beyond algorithmic\\ndetails to capture the conceptual contribution of the paper. Finally, the Application\\nfield grounds the method unit by indicating downstream research and system-level implications,\\nwithout enumerating task-specific benchmarks.\\n\\n\\nThis example demonstrates that the extraction agent isolates reusable methodological structure while\\nfiltering out implementation-level details. By representing the paper as a coherent method unit\\nrather than a collection of experimental components, Idea2Story enables subsequent reuse,\\ncomparison, and composition of methodological ideas across papers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3 Knowledge Graph Analysis\\n\\nWe analyze the structure of the constructed knowledge graph to understand how extracted method\\nunits are distributed across papers and research domains. As illustrated in Figure 2, the graph\\nexhibits a clear hub-and-spoke structure, where a small number of high-frequency domains connect\\nto a large number of papers and research patterns. This reflects the uneven distribution of\\nresearch activity across domains, while also highlighting domains that function as central hubs\\nfor methodological reuse. Importantly, many research patterns are observed to connect multiple\\ndomains simultaneously, indicating that the extracted method units often capture methodological\\nabstractions that generalize beyond a single application area. In contrast, paper-level nodes are typically associated with a single domain, whereas pattern-level nodes frequently act as bridges between otherwise weakly connected domains. This structural separation suggests that the knowledge graph encodes two distinct levels of organization\\u2014instance-level\\n\\nFigure 4: Visualization of the knowledge graph substructure induced by high-frequency research\\ndomains.\\n\\n\\nresearch artifacts and reusable methodological abstractions\\u2014enabling Idea2Story to retrieve and compose research patterns at a higher level of abstraction rather than relying on domain-specific or paper-specific similarity alone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAspect\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIdea2Story Generated (IntentDiff)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLLM Direct Generated (EcoIntent)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTitle\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIntentDiff: Reframing E-commerce Intent Classification via Structural Evolution and Context-Aware Diffusion\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEcoIntent: A Context-Aware Multi-Granularity Agent for E-commerce Intent Understanding via Hierarchical Contrastive Learning\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbstract Focus\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReinterprets intent classification as a structural evolution process rather than static text classification. The approach leverages a diffusion-based framework to iteratively refine noisy query representations into precise intent labels, integrates product graph embeddings to ground predictions in e-commerce context, and introduces a discrete, context-aware tokenizer to handle long-tail domain vocabulary.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTargets improved intent classification performance by integrating heterogeneous behavioral context and hierarchical product knowledge. A dual-stream architecture aligns semantic representations with user interaction history, and hierarchical contrastive learning enforces consistency across fine- and coarse-grained intent categories.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProblem Definition\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReframes e-commerce intent classification from static text prediction to dynamic structural reasoning. User queries are short, ambiguous, and heavily dependent on implicit catalog structure, which fixed-label classification fails to capture. Intent understanding is modeled as an evolving process under structural constraints.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFormulates intent understanding as a conventional multi-class classification problem, where the input is a query augmented with session context and the output is an intent label from a predefined set. The main challenge is semantic sparsity caused by short and ambiguous queries.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCore Research Gap\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExisting intent classification methods treat queries in isolation and ignore domain-specific structural priors in e-commerce. They fail to exploit rich relationships between products and attributes, and standard vocabularies struggle with long-tail, domain-specific terminology. No prior work unifies diffusion-based refinement with structural graph embeddings for intent disambiguation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrior work suffers from (1) context isolation, where behavioral signals such as clicks are underutilized, and (2) a flat-label assumption that ignores the hierarchical nature of e-commerce taxonomies, leading to inconsistent predictions for fine-grained, long-tail intents.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMethod Skeleton\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA diffusion-based classifier that iteratively denoises intent representations; a context-aware discrete tokenizer based on a VQ-VAE variant to encode diverse e-commerce queries; and integration of pretrained product graph embeddings as structural priors during the denoising process.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA dual-stream discriminative architecture consisting of a BERT-based text encoder, a lightweight GNN for aggregating behavioral interaction graphs, and a prediction head trained with hierarchical contrastive learning; parameter-efficient adaptation via LoRA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInnovation Claims\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(1) Reformulates intent classification as a diffusion-based dynamic refinement process;\\n(2) Introduces discrete, context-aware intent tokenization to better handle long-tail domain vocabulary;\\n(3) Enhances intent reasoning by incorporating product graph structural embeddings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(1) Contextualized intent modeling via joint reasoning over text and behavioral graphs;\\n(2) Hierarchical contrastive learning leveraging product taxonomies;\\n(3) Parameter-efficient system design achieving strong performance at reduced computational cost.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 1: \\nComparison of research patterns generated by Idea2Story and a direct LLM baseline,\\nboth starting from the same underspecified user input:\\n\\u201cI want to build an e-commerce agent that can better understand user intent.\\u201d\\nThe table contrasts how different generation mechanisms transform the same vague research intent\\ninto concrete research patterns.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.4 Qualitative Comparison of Generated Research Patterns\\n\\nWe further compare the quality of research patterns generated by Idea2Story and a direct LLM\\nbaseline. Both systems start from the same underspecified user input and produce structured\\nresearch proposals, enabling a controlled comparison of how different generation mechanisms\\ntransform vague research intent into concrete research patterns.\\n\\n\\nTable 1 presents a side-by-side comparison of representative outputs along multiple dimensions,\\nincluding problem formulation, methodological structure, and innovation claims. Rather than\\nevaluating surface-level writing quality, the comparison focuses on the resulting research\\npatterns as methodological blueprints\\u2014i.e., how the generated ideas frame the research problem,\\nidentify gaps in prior work, and organize methodological components into a coherent approach. As shown in the table, Idea2Story tends to induce higher-level problem reformulation, transforming\\nintent understanding from a fixed classification task into a dynamic structural reasoning process.\\nThe resulting research pattern emphasizes generative refinement, structural priors, and evolving\\nrepresentations. In contrast, the direct LLM baseline largely operates within a conventional task\\nformulation, proposing a stronger system through the integration of additional components such as\\ncontext modeling and hierarchical objectives.\\n\\n\\nTo reduce evaluation bias, the generated research stories from both approaches are subsequently\\nassessed by an independent large language model (Gemini 3 Pro) (team2025gemma), which is not involved in either generation process. The evaluator is instructed to compare the outputs in terms of novelty, methodological substance, and overall research quality, without access to the generation method\\nused. Across all evaluated cases, the externally evaluated results consistently favor the outputs\\ngenerated by Idea2Story. In particular, the research stories produced by direct LLM generation tend\\nto remain at a high level of abstraction, with less concrete methodological grounding and reliance\\non relatively standard techniques. In contrast, Idea2Story-generated research patterns exhibit\\nclearer problem framing, more specific methodological structures, and stronger signals of novelty.\\n\\n\\n\", \"5 Future Work\": \"\\n\\n5 Future Work\\n\\nWhile Idea2Story focuses on grounding vague research intent into structured and high-quality research patterns, an important direction for future work is to extend this framework toward a fully closed-loop research generation pipeline. A promising extension is the integration of experiment-driven agents that can instantiate, validate, and iteratively refine generated research patterns through empirical feedback, including automated experimental design, dataset selection, and preliminary execution. Experimental outcomes can then serve as additional signals to refine the instantiated research stories, forming a feedback loop between method design and empirical validation. Beyond experimentation, future work may further explore how refined research patterns can be systematically translated into complete paper drafts, covering method descriptions, experimental results, and discussion sections. By grounding paper generation in empirically validated research patterns, such a system could move beyond surface-level text generation and provide more faithful, end-to-end support for executable and publishable scientific discovery.\\n\\n\", \"6 Conclusion\": \"\\n\\n6 Conclusion\\n\\nWe presented Idea2Story, a pre-computation\\u2013driven framework for autonomous scientific discovery that shifts literature understanding from runtime reasoning to offline knowledge structuring. By explicitly extracting reusable method units and organizing them into a continuously updated knowledge graph, Idea2Story enables research agents to reason over stable research patterns rather than repeatedly processing raw papers. Our qualitative analyses and comparative studies show that this design leads to research patterns with clearer problem reformulation, stronger methodological structure, and higher conceptual novelty than direct LLM generation. These results highlight the importance of explicit pattern modeling as a foundation for scalable and reliable autonomous research. Looking ahead, integrating Idea2Story with experimental agents to close the loop from abstract research patterns to validated empirical results represents a promising direction toward fully autonomous and trustworthy scientific discovery.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"}, \"bibliography\": {}, \"domain\": \"cs.CE\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"c55ef7db-caf6-4db2-8efe-7f71652018ab\", \"authors\": [\"Christopher Willby\", \"Tomohiro Hashizume\", \"Jason Crain\", \"Dieter Jaksch\"], \"title\": \"Symplectic Optimization on Gaussian States\", \"abstract\": \"Computing Gaussian ground states via variational optimization is challenging because the covariance matrices must satisfy the uncertainty principle, rendering constrained or Riemannian optimization costly, delicate, and thus difficult to scale, particularly in large and inhomogeneous systems. We introduce a symplectic optimization framework that addresses this challenge by parameterizing covariance matrices directly as positive-definite symplectic matrices using unit-triangular factorizations. This approach enforces all physical constraints exactly, yielding a globally unconstrained variational formulation of the bosonic ground-state problem. The unconstrained structure also naturally supports solution reuse across nearby Hamiltonians: warm-starting from previously optimized covariance matrices substantially reduces the number of optimization steps required for convergence in families of related configurations, as encountered in crystal lattices, molecular systems, and fluids. We demonstrate the method on weakly dipole-coupled lattices, recovering ground-state energies, covariance matrices, and spectral gaps accurately.

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [18] and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [9] have achieved high-fidelity rendering, with 3DGS in particular becoming the mainstream choice for its real-time rendering capability. However, both methods require densely captured training images, which are often difficult to obtain, and they tend to produce artifacts at extrapolated viewpoints, namely those outside the interpolation range of the training views. These limitations hinder their use in downstream applications such as autonomous driving simulation and free-viewpoint user experiences.\\n\\n\\nRecent work has explored addressing artifacts in extrapolated view rendering with 3DGS. Existing approaches fall into two categories: adding regularization terms during training or augmenting supervision views using generative models. The regularization terms are often derived from 3D priors [48, 52, 10, 50, 32], or additional sensors [21], but they are typically hand-crafted and limited to specific scene types. Moreover, their lack of hallucination capability further restricts their applicability.\\nIn leveraging diffusion models (DMs), some approaches fine-tune them with paired data, e.g., by using sparse LiDAR inputs or extrapolated renderings with artifacts to generate refined images. Many of these methods train on domain-specific datasets, such as those for autonomous driving [41, 36, 20, 35], which inevitably compromises the generalization ability of DMs. More recently, Difix3D+ [37] fine-tunes SD Turbo [25] on a wider range of 3D datasets, improving generalization. However, the substantial effort required to curate 3D data and the high fine-tuning cost make this approach time-consuming and expensive to extend to other DMs.\\nAn alternative line of work seeks to improve extrapolated rendering without fine-tuning, typically by providing extrapolated renderings as guidance during the denoising step. This preserves the generalization capacity of DMs trained on large-scale data, but such methods still lag behind fine-tuned approaches that are specifically adapted to the task.\\n\\n\\nGiven the generalization\\u2013fidelity trade-off, we ask: can extrapolated view rendering be improved with DMs without sacrificing generalization? To address this challenge, we focus on fine-tuning-free methods and enhance their effectiveness for NVS extrapolation. This is achieved with our proposed 2D\\u20133D interleaved refinement strategy combined with per-pixel confidence guidance for fine-tuning-free image refinement. Specifically, given a trained 3DGS, we sample an extrapolated viewpoint, render the 2D image, refine it with a 2D image diffusion model (IDMs), and integrate the refined image back into the 3D scene by updating the 3DGS before proceeding to the next viewpoint.\\nThis interleaved 2D-3D refinement ensures that previously enhanced views inform subsequent 2D refinements and improve multi-view consistency. Importantly, we introduce a confidence-guided 2D refinement, where a per-pixel confidence map rendered from the 3DGS highlights regions requiring further improvement by the 2D DM. This contrasts with previous training-free methods that rely solely on rendering opacity, leaving the DM to identify artifact regions on its own. While our confidence guidance could in principle be applied to video diffusion models (VDMs), advanced video backbones are typically more computationally expensive and use temporal down-sampling, which prevents the direct use of per-pixel guidance. We show that our 2D\\u20133D interleaved optimization strategy achieves consistent refined images without relying on VDMs.\\n\\n\\nOur contribution can be summarized as follows: 1) We propose a simple yet effective approach for enhancing extrapolated 3DGS rendering without the need for fine-tuning DMs, featuring a 2D\\u20133D interleaved refinement strategy and per-pixel confidence guidance. 2) Our method is compatible with various DMs and preserves generalization across diverse scene contents. 3) Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing fine-tuning-free methods and achieves comparable or even superior performance to training-based methods.\\n\\n\", \"2 Related Work\": \"\\n\\n2 Related Work\\n\\nNumerous works have made efforts on improving quality of NVS. In this section, we will discuss related works in NVS and 3D reconstruction. Furthermore, we will explore efforts that improve NVS quality by incorporating priors from geometry, physics or generative models.\\n\\n\\nNovel View Synthesis: \\nNVS aims to generate photorealistic images of a scene from novel viewpoints. Early methods primarily relied on traditional image-based rendering techniques, such as Light Field Rendering [14], Image-Based Rendering [28], and Multi-Plane Image [55, 30]. These approaches typically interpolate between existing views and are often limited by dense input imagery and struggle with complex occlusions. The advent of deep learning revolutionized NVS, led by two major paradigms: NeRF [18] and 3DGS [9]. NeRF implicitly represents a scene and achieves high-quality results, but its training and rendering speeds are slow. In contrast, 3DGS offers rapid training and real-time rendering. However, a significant limitation of 3DGS is the occurrence of visual artifacts in extrapolated views, which are viewpoints far from the training data. These artifacts compromise the realism and geometric fidelity of the synthesized images. Mitigating these artifacts is the focus of this paper.\\n\\n\\nNVS with Geometry Priors: \\nTo enhance the robustness of NVS models and reduce reconstruction ambiguity, many works have introduced geometry priors. These priors provide key information about the scene\\u2019s 3D structure, which can be explicitly provided by external sensors like LiDAR or depth cameras [21, 41, 36, 23, 40, 17, 8]. Other methods utilize strong structural priors often found in real-world scenes, such as the assumption that the ground is a flat plane [52, 10, 5], the sky can be modeled as a dome [4, 43], or that walls and tables in indoor scenes are predominantly orthogonal [48]. These structural assumptions help regularize the reconstruction process. While these geometry priors can mitigate some reconstruction challenges, they often fall short of completely solving the artifact problem in extrapolated views, especially when the initial geometric prior is itself inaccurate.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: Method. FreeFix improves the rendering quality of extrapolated views in 3DGS without fine-tuning DMs, as illustrated in the bottom left of the pipeline. We propose an interleaved strategy that combines 2D and 3D refinement to utilize image diffusion models for generating multi-frame consistent results, as shown at the top of the pipeline. In the 2D refinement stage, we also introduce confidence guidance and overall guidance to enhance the quality and consistency of the denoising results.\\n\\n\\nNVS with Generative Priors: \\nGenerative priors leverage pre-trained generative models to assist NVS tasks, particularly when dealing with data scarcity or missing information. Early works explored using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to improve rendering quality [39, 24, 26], where the GAN\\u2019s discriminator ensured the local realism of synthesized images. More recently, DMs [33, 22, 13, 31, 42, 11, 12, 34] have gained prominence for their powerful generative capabilities. Their application in NVS falls into two main categories. The first involves fine-tuning a pre-trained DM, which has learned powerful priors from datasets [37, 41, 35, 38, 54, 49, 47]. This process adapts the model\\u2019s knowledge to scene-specific appearances but can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. The second category, which aligns with our proposed method, leverages a pre-trained DM as a zero-shot prior without fine-tuning. The key challenge here is determining what part of the rendered image should be used as guidance for the DM, and how to maintain multi-view consistency. Using the opacity channel of the rendered image as guidance is a common but often crude solution [45, 16, 46], as areas with high opacity can still be artifacts. Additionally, ensuring consistency across different novel views using IDMs is a critical problem. While VDMs [33, 31, 42, 11] can inherently handle this, they are often computationally heavy and not suitable for all applications.\\n\\n\", \"3 Method\": \"\\n\\n3 Method\\n\\nThe FreeFix pipeline is illustrated in Fig.\\u00a02.

VDMs are widely used for improving 3DGS [9] because of the inherent capability to apply attention across frames, ensuring multi-frame consistency. However, the temporal attention mechanism also introduces a computational burden,\\nwhich also limits the output length of VDMs, as the computation complexity is quadratic in relation to the sequence length. Furthermore, recent advanced VDMs [42, 11, 31] utilize 3D VAE as their encoder and decoder, which performs temporal down-sampling, making it challenging to apply per-pixel confidence guidance.\\n\\n\\nDue to the above reasons, we select IDMs as the backbone in FreeFix. However, most existing IDMs are not designed for the novel view synthesis task and do not take reference views as input. IP-Adapter [44] accepts image prompts as input, but it is intended for style prompts rather than novel view synthesis. Directly applying IDMs can lead to inconsistency across frames and finally result in blurriness in refined 3DGS. To tackle the problem, we propose an interleaved refining strategy, multi-level confidence guidance, and overall guidance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3 Interleaved Refinement Strategy\\n\\n2D Refinement: \\nAs mentioned in Sec.\\u00a03.1, the trajectory of extrapolated views \\ud835\\udcafext={\\ud835\\udcb10e,\\ud835\\udcb11e,\\u2026,\\ud835\\udcb1me}\\\\mathcal{T}_{\\\\textit{ext}}=\\\\{\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{0},\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{1},...,\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{m}\\\\} in our task definition is intended to be continuous. This continuous trajectory setting ensures that adjacent views \\ud835\\udcb1ie\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i} and \\ud835\\udcb1i+1e\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i+1} undergo only small transformations. A naive approach to keep consistency would be warping pixels from \\ud835\\udcb1ie\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i} to \\ud835\\udcb1i+1e\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i+1} and using DMs for inpainting. However, both rendered depth and predicted depth are not reliable for warping. Instead, we propose an interleaved refining strategy to enhance multi-view consistency.\\n\\n\\nSpecifically, the refining process is interleaved and incremental along the trajectory \\ud835\\udcaf\\\\mathcal{T}. Given the current view \\ud835\\udcb1ie\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i}, the current 3DGS \\ud835\\udca2i\\u22121\\\\mathcal{G}_{i-1} and rendered image \\u2110^ie=\\u03c0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb1ie;\\ud835\\udca2i\\u22121)\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e}_{i}=\\\\pi(\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i};\\\\mathcal{G}_{i-1}), we utilize denoising with guidance, as discussed in Sec.\\u00a03.4, to obtain the fixed image \\u2110^ie,f\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{i}. We also maintain a fixed image set \\u2131i\\u22121={(\\ud835\\udcb10e,\\u2110^0e,f),(\\ud835\\udcb11e,\\u2110^1e,f),\\u2026,(\\ud835\\udcb1i\\u22121e,\\u2110^i\\u22121e,f)}\\\\mathcal{F}_{i-1}=\\\\{(\\\\mathcal{V}_{0}^{e},\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{0}),(\\\\mathcal{V}_{1}^{e},\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{1}),...,(\\\\mathcal{V}_{i-1}^{e},\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{i-1})\\\\}. We refine the current 3DGS \\ud835\\udca2i\\u22121\\\\mathcal{G}_{i-1} to \\ud835\\udca2i\\\\mathcal{G}_{i} by using the training set \\ud835\\udcaet\\u200br\\u200ba\\u200bi\\u200bn\\\\mathcal{S}_{train}, the previous refined view set \\u2131i\\u22121\\\\mathcal{F}_{i-1} and the current refined image \\u2110^ie,f\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{i}.\\n\\n\\n3D Refinement: \\nThe supervision during 3D Refinement for \\ud835\\udca2i\\\\mathcal{G}_{i} comes from current refined view (\\ud835\\udcb1ie,\\u2110^ie,f)(\\\\mathcal{V}_{i}^{e},\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{i}), \\u2131i\\u22121\\\\mathcal{F}_{i-1} and St\\u200br\\u200ba\\u200bi\\u200bnS_{train}. The detailed sampling strategy for training is illustrated in the supplements.\\n\\n\\nThe generated results do not guarantee 3D consistency with training views, so we employ a smaller training loss for the generated views to prevent inaccurately generated areas from distorting 3D scenes. Additionally, the generated results exhibit slightly color bias compared to training views, which are often difficult for humans to distinguish. However, when applying the interleaved refining strategy, these slight color biases will accumulate, which may lead to a blurry and over-gray effect. We implement a simple yet efficient technique similar to [53] to tackle the problem. For each generated view, we define two optimizable affine matrices \\ud835\\udc9cf\\u2208\\u211d3\\u00d73\\\\mathcal{A}_{f}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{3\\\\times 3} and \\ud835\\udc9cb\\u2208\\u211d3\\u00d71\\\\mathcal{A}_{b}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{3\\\\times 1}.

A small \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} with high overall certainty is used for the early stages of denoising, while a large \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} which offers greater accuracy, is applied during the later stages of denoising.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4 Denoising with Guidance\\n\\nGiven the rendered results of an extrapolated view, even though the image contains artifacts, most areas can still be regarded as photo-realistic rendering results. These regions with relatively high fidelity can provide essential information for generating an image free of artifacts, while maintaining almost the same content.\\n\\n\\nExperiments in Difix3D+ [37] have demonstrated that adding noise to images with artifacts and directly applying denoising using DMs can effectively remove these artifacts; however, the strength of the added noise is quite sensitive. For regions with significant artifacts, a larger scale of noise is needed to repaint those areas, while a smaller scale of noise is sufficient for areas with minimal artifacts. Although it may seem intuitive to apply different levels of noise to different regions, this approach does not align the data distribution of DMs. Instead, employing guidance during the diffusion denoising step is more practical and has been widely adopted in [16, 45].\\n\\n\\nConfidence Map: \\nUtilizing appropriate guidance is an effective method for generating high-fidelity images while preserving accurate rendering results. However, current approaches that use warp masks or rendering opacities as guidance weights do not account for the presence of artifacts. For example, as illustrated in Fig.\\u00a03 (a), even when severe artifacts are present, the rendering opacities remain high, indicating that these artifacts continue to act as strong guidance during the denoising process.\\nTo tackle this issue, we propose utilizing confidence masks as guidance weights, as shown in Fig.\\u00a03 (c). The confidence scores are derived from Fisher information, which is also referenced in [7, 6]. Specifically, Fisher information measures the amount of information that the observation (x,y)(x,y) carries about the unknown parameters ww that model pf\\u200b(y|x;w)p_{f}(y|x;w). In the context of novel view synthesis, Fisher information can be defined as:\\n\\n\\n\\npf\\u200b(\\u03c0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)|\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)p_{f}(\\\\pi(\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})|\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})\\n\\n(5)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udcb1\\\\mathcal{V} and \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G} represent viewpoint and 3DGS respectively, while \\u03c0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)\\\\pi(\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}) denotes the volume rendering results at the specific view \\ud835\\udcb1\\\\mathcal{V}.\\n\\n\\nThe negative log likelihood of Fisher information in Eq.\\u00a05, which serves as the uncertainty \\ud835\\udc9e\\u00af\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{\\\\bar{C}}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}} of \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G} at view \\ud835\\udcb1\\\\mathcal{V}, can be approximately derived as a Hessian matrix, the detailed derivation can be found in the supplementary materials:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9e\\u00af\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\\\displaystyle\\\\mathcal{\\\\bar{C}}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}\\n=\\u2212log\\u2061pf\\u200b(\\u03c0|\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)\\\\displaystyle=-\\\\log p_{f}(\\\\pi|\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n=\\ud835\\udc07\\u2032\\u2032\\u200b[\\u03c0|\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2]\\\\displaystyle=\\\\mathbf{H}^{{}^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}}[\\\\pi|\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n=\\u2207\\ud835\\udca2\\u03c0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)T\\u200b\\u2207\\ud835\\udca2\\u03c0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)\\\\displaystyle=\\\\nabla_{\\\\mathcal{G}}\\\\pi(\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})^{T}\\\\nabla_{\\\\mathcal{G}}\\\\pi(\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})\\n\\n(6)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[7, 6] renders the attribute \\ud835\\udc9e\\u00af\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{\\\\bar{C}}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}} in volume rendering to obtain the uncertainty map. However, uncertainty is not a numerically stable representation, as its value can range from [0,+\\u221e)[0,+\\\\infty). As illustrated in Fig.\\u00a03 (b), the numeric instability of uncertainty may render an inaccurate uncertainty map. This often occurs when there are Gaussians with low opacity and high uncertainty, which can overwhelm the volume rendering. Instead, we use the complementary value as guidance, certainty \\ud835\\udc9e\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}, also referred to as confidence in this paper, which has a stable numeric range of [0,1][0,1].\\nThe certainty \\ud835\\udc9e\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\u03b3c\\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}^{\\\\gamma_{c}} is defined as:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9e\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\u03b3c=exp\\u2061[\\u2212\\u03b3c\\u200b\\ud835\\udc9e\\u00af\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2]\\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}^{\\\\gamma_{c}}=\\\\exp[-\\\\gamma_{c}\\\\mathcal{\\\\bar{C}}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}]\\n\\n(7)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} is a hyperparameter.

The larger the value of \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c}, the more sensitive the rendered confidence map becomes to artifacts. Selecting a single appropriate \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} is not trivial. Therefore, we apply multi-level confidence maps as guidance. Since DMs generate a coarse structure of image rather than detailed appearance in the early denoising stages [27], we provide \\u2133\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\u03b3c\\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}^{\\\\gamma_{c}} with a small \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} to offer more comprehensive guidance. In the later denoising stages, DMs tend to generate detailed appearances, so we provide \\u2133\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\u03b3c\\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}^{\\\\gamma_{c}} with a large \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} to ensure that the guidance is sufficiently accurate.\\n\\n\\nConfidence Guidance: \\nGiven the rendered image I^\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\\\hat{I}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}} and the corresponding confidence map \\u2133\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\u03b3c\\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}^{\\\\gamma_{c}}, we can provide denoising guidance to DMs.\\nWe denote the rendered image after VAE encoding as x0rx_{0}^{r}, and the resized confidence map that aligns with the shape of the latent space as \\u2133c\\\\mathcal{M}^{c}. As illustrated in Eq.\\u00a02, the predicted x0tx_{0}^{t} at tt timestep is given by xt\\u2212\\u03c3t\\u200b\\ud835\\udd3d\\u03b8\\u200b(xt,t)x_{t}-\\\\sigma_{t}\\\\mathbb{F}_{\\\\theta}(x_{t},t). We guide the model prediction as x0t,gx_{0}^{t,g} by blending the rendered image using confidence mask:\\n\\n\\n\\nx0t,g=\\u2133c\\u2299x0r+(1\\u2212\\u2133c)\\u2299x0tx_{0}^{t,g}=\\\\mathcal{M}^{c}\\\\odot x_{0}^{r}+(1-\\\\mathcal{M}^{c})\\\\odot x_{0}^{t}\\n\\n(9)\\n\\n\\nHowever, the input for the next denoising step cannot be directly obtained using Eq.\\u00a03 since the model prediction x0tx_{0}^{t} has been changed. Instead, we derive the new xt\\u22121x_{t-1} by solving the following equations:\\n\\n\\n\\nxt\\u22121\\\\displaystyle x_{t-1}\\n=x0+\\u03c3t\\u22121\\u200b\\ud835\\udd3d\\u03b8\\u200b(xt,t)\\\\displaystyle=x_{0}+\\\\sigma_{t-1}\\\\mathbb{F}_{\\\\theta}(x_{t},t)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nxt\\u22121\\\\displaystyle x_{t-1}\\n=xt+(\\u03c3t\\u22121\\u2212\\u03c3t)\\u200b\\ud835\\udd3d\\u03b8\\u200b(xt,t)\\\\displaystyle=x_{t}+(\\\\sigma_{t-1}-\\\\sigma_{t})\\\\mathbb{F}_{\\\\theta}(x_{t},t)\\n\\n(10)\\n\\n\\nThe representation of xt\\u22121x_{t-1} derived from x0t,gx_{0}^{t,g} and xtx_{t} is:\\n\\n\\n\\nxt\\u22121=\\u03c3t\\u22121\\u03c3t\\u200bxt\\u2212\\u03c3t\\u22121\\u2212\\u03c3t\\u03c3t\\u200bx0t,gx_{t-1}=\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{t-1}}{\\\\sigma_{t}}x_{t}-\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{t-1}-\\\\sigma_{t}}{\\\\sigma_{t}}x_{0}^{t,g}\\n\\n(11)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOverall Guidance: \\nAlthough the interleaved refining strategy provides higher fidelity rendering results and ensures that the rendering is more consistent with the generated content, using IDMs may still encounter issues of inconsistency in areas with low confidence. Particularly in regions with weak textures like ground and sky, the confidence map tends to be low, and allowing denoising to proceed freely in these areas can result in high inconsistency and blurriness in 3DGS. To address this issue, we propose an overall guidance approach, which combines confidence guidance in the very early stages of denoising to provide structural hints for the images.\\nThe combination of certainty and overall guidance is defined as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\nx0t,g=\\\\displaystyle x_{0}^{t,g}=\\n\\u2133c\\u2299x0r+\\\\displaystyle\\\\mathcal{M}^{c}\\\\odot x_{0}^{r}+\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(1\\u2212\\u2133c)\\u2299(\\u03b2\\u200b\\u2133\\u03b1\\u200bx0r+(1\\u2212\\u03b2\\u200b\\u2133\\u03b1)\\u200bx0t)\\\\displaystyle(1-\\\\mathcal{M}^{c})\\\\odot(\\\\beta\\\\mathcal{M}^{\\\\alpha}x_{0}^{r}+(1-\\\\beta\\\\mathcal{M}^{\\\\alpha})x_{0}^{t})\\n\\n(12)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u03b2\\\\beta is a hyperparameter that controls the strength of the overall guidance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLLFF [19]\\n\\n\\nMip-NeRF 360 [1]\\n\\n\\nWaymo \\u2009 [29]\\n\\nDM Type\\nw/o Finetune\\nOnly RGBs\\n3D Render\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPSNR\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nSSIM\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nLPIPS\\u2193\\\\downarrow\\n\\n\\nPSNR\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nSSIM\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nLPIPS\\u2193\\\\downarrow\\n\\n\\nKID\\u2193\\\\downarrow\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3DGS [9]\\n\\n18.10\\n0.633\\n0.265\\n21.83\\n0.643\\n0.239\\n0.155\\nN/A\\nN/A\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\nFreeFix + SDXL\\n19.93\\n0.695\\n0.237\\n22.68\\n0.685\\n0.213\\n0.150\\nImage\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\nFreeFix + Flux\\n20.12\\n0.700\\n0.221\\n23.02\\n0.689\\n0.208\\n0.147\\nImage\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\n\\nViewExtrapolator [16]\\n\\n18.27\\n0.614\\n0.338\\n20.84\\n0.591\\n0.332\\n0.180\\nVideo\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\n\\nNVS-Solver [45]\\n\\n11.99\\n0.351\\n0.560\\n12.45\\n0.266\\n0.631\\n0.289\\nVideo\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2718\\n\\n\\n\\nDifix3D+ [37]\\n\\n18.86\\n0.658\\n0.239\\n22.43\\n0.661\\n0.210\\n0.143\\nImage\\n\\u2718\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\n\\nStreetCrafter [41]\\n\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\n0.157\\nVideo\\n\\u2718\\n\\u2718\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 1: Quantitative Comparison with Baselines.

We select LLFF [19] as the evaluation dataset for forward-facing scenes, Mip-NeRF 360 [1] for object-centric scenes, and Waymo [29] for driving scenes.\\nFor the LLFF and MipNeRF datasets, which contain relatively dense captured images, we select sparse or partially observed views as the training set and choose an extrapolated view trajectory that is distant from the views in the training set. The Waymo dataset only provides captured images from a single pass down the street, making it relatively sparse. We only utilize the front cameras as the training set and then translate or rotate the training cameras to create the test views. Details on the design of the training and testing views are provided in the supplementary materials.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWaymo / 143481\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWaymo / 177619\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3DGS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nViewExtrapolator [45]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStreetCrafter [41]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDifix3D+ [37]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFreeFix\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 7: Qualitative Comparisons on Waymo [29]. FreeFix provide superior performance compared to ViewExtrapolator and StreetCrafter, and is comparable to Difix3D+ in the Waymo dataset. In some cases, FreeFix refines the scene even better than Difix3D+.\\n\\n\\n\\nModel Settings and Baselines: \\nFreeFix utilizes two powerful IDMs as its backbone: SDXL [22] and Flux [13], to showcase the capabilities of our method.\\nFor baseline selection, we consider various methods with different settings. For fine-tuning-free methods, we select ViewExtrapolator [16], and NVS-Solver [45] as the baseline. While ViewExtrapolator refines 3DGS with generated views like ours, NVS-Solver employs VDMs as the final renderer, without using 3D renderers, which consumes more computational resources during rendering.\\nFor methods that require fine-tuning of DMs, we choose Difix3D+ [37] and StreetCrafter [41] as baselines. StreetCrafter focuses on urban scenes and requires both LiDAR and RGB observations as input, while Difix3D+ is more generalizable and only requires RGB images. For all methods with a 3D renderer, we apply nearly the same 3D refining steps, ensuring that there are sufficient refining steps for the models to converge.\\n\\n\\nEvaluation Metrics: \\nFor the experiments on LLFF and MipNeRF, we adopt the most common settings for quantitative assessments, which include the evaluation of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS [51]. In the case of the Waymo dataset, where no ground truth is available for the test images, we utilize KID [2] for quantitative assessments.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.1 Comparison with Baselines\\n\\nWe evaluate FreeFix using SDXL [22] and Flux [13] as the diffusion backbone on the LLFF, Mip-NeRF 360, and Waymo datasets. This includes a quantitative comparison in Tab.\\u00a01 and qualitative comparisons in Fig.\\u00a05 and Fig.\\u00a07 against baseline methods. Although FreeFix utilizes only IDMs as the backbone and does not require fine-tuning of the DMs, it still demonstrates performance that is comparable to, or even surpasses, methods that use VDMs or require fine-tuning, both in quantitative and qualitative assessments.\\n\\n\\nSpecifically, ViewExtrapolator [16], which uses opacity masks as guidance, shows slight improvements in LLFF, although the improvement is less significant compared to our confidence-guided solution.\\nMoreover, it fails to provide improvements in Mip-NeRF 360 and Waymo.\\nThis is due to the fact that ViewExtrapolator uses the nearest view from a set of training views as the reference view to generate the test views in a video diffusion model.\\nWhile using the nearest training view as the reference view in SVD performs well in the forward-facing scenes in LLFF, where the test views are closer to the training views, this is usually not the case for Mip-NeRF 360 and Waymo, hence ViewExtrapolator yields degraded performance.\\n\\n\\nDifix3D+ demonstrates the most generalizability and powerful performance across our baselines. FreeFix surpasses Difix3D+ [37] in LLFF and Mip-NeRF 360, while providing comparable performance in Waymo.\\nWe attribute this to the generalizability of DMs. Although Difix3D+ is finetuned on DLV3D [15] and may have encountered similar scenes to those in LLFF and Mip-NeRF 360, the domain gap between datasets still weakens the generalizability of Difix3D+. In contrast, our method maintains the original generalizability of DMs learned from web-scale datasets. Regarding the Waymo dataset, Difix3D+ is fine-tuned on a large-scale in-house driving dataset, where driving scenes are highly structured and exhibit relatively small inter-class differences, making them easier for models to learn.\\n\\n\\nStreetCrafter [41] is tailored for urban scenes and requires LiDAR as input; for this reason, we only conduct experiments with this model on the Waymo dataset. In contrast to the original setting in StreetCrafter, our setup only provides the front camera to color the LiDAR points, which highlights the limitations of StreetCrafter in this context.\\nNVS-Solver produces less satisfying results compared to other methods, which may be attributed to inaccurate depth estimation and warping results. We provide NVS-Solver results in supplementary materials.\\n\\n\\nPlease note that we compute the average score across scenes for each dataset. We provide a quantitative comparison for each scene, along with additional qualitative comparisons in the supplementary materials.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.2 Ablation Study\\n\\nImage Diffusion Models vs Video Diffusion Models: \\nFreeFix can also be applied to VDMs without temporal down-sampling, such as SVD [3]. Although SVD offers inherent consistency across frames, it suffers from blurriness compared to more advanced IDMs. We conduct an ablation study on the scene from MipNeRF-360/Garden to provide quantitative and qualitative comparisons in Tab.\\u00a02 and Fig.\\u00a06. Additionally, we include the results from ViewExtrapolator [16] on the same scene. While ViewExtrapolator also uses SVD as its backbone, it employs an opacity mask as guidance, which disentangles the effects of the differences in diffusion model backbones and helps demonstrate the effectiveness of our confidence guidance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPSNR\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nSSIM\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nLPIPS\\u2193\\\\downarrow\\n\\nGuidance\\n\\n\\n3DGS\\n18.38\\n0.415\\n0.357\\nN/A\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVE [16] + SVD\\n\\n17.86\\n0.409\\n0.505\\nOpacity\\n\\n\\nFreeFix + SVD\\n19.03\\n0.453\\n0.331\\nCertainty\\n\\n\\nFreeFix + SDXL\\n19.41\\n0.517\\n0.294\\nCertainty\\n\\n\\nFreeFix + Flux\\n19.72\\n0.520\\n0.287\\nCertainty\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 2: Quantitative Ablation on Diffusion Models Selection. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPSNR\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nSSIM\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nLPIPS\\u2193\\\\downarrow\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRaw Flux [13]\\n\\n19.23\\n0.390\\n0.389\\n\\n\\n+ Confidence Guidance\\n19.32\\n0.435\\n0.349\\n\\n\\n+ Interleave Strategy\\n19.65\\n0.517\\n0.293\\n\\n\\n+ Overall Guidance\\n19.72\\n0.520\\n0.287\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 3: Ablation Study on Modules of FreeFix.

We conduct an ablation study of these modules on the scene from MipNeRF-360/Garden, as shown in Tab.\\u00a03. We perform experiments starting from a raw Flux model, which we slightly modify to function as an image-to-image model. We progressively add components from FreeFix to demonstrate the necessity of these techniques.\\n\\n\\n\", \"5 Conclusion\": \"\\n\\n5 Conclusion\\n\\nIn this paper, we present FreeFix, a method for fixing artifacts and improving the quality of 3DGS without fine-tuning DMs. FreeFix demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across various datasets and possesses strong capabilities for deployment with future, more advanced DMs.\\nHowever, FreeFix still has certain limitations. It may encounter failure cases when extrapolated views lead to excessive artifacts with minimal credible guidance. Additionally, the updating process for 3DGS is relatively slow and challenging to converge over dozens of refining steps. These challenges suggest opportunities for future work on designing more robust and efficient methods for integrating 3D reconstruction with 2D generative models.\\n\\n\\nAcknowledgements:\\nThis work is supported by NSFC under grant 62202418, U21B2004, and 62441223, the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2021ZD0114501, and Scientific Research Fund of Zhejiang University grant XY2025028.\\n\\n\\n\", \"6 3DGS Fisher Information Derivation\": \"\\n\\n6 3DGS Fisher Information Derivation\\n\\nThe uncertainty attribute of 3DGS in this paper is defined as:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9e\\u00af\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2=\\u2212log\\u2061pf\\u200b(\\u03c0|\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)\\\\mathcal{\\\\bar{C}}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}=-\\\\log p_{f}(\\\\pi|\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})\\n\\n(13)\\n\\n\\nUnder the following regularity conditions, \\u2212log\\u2061pf\\u200b(\\u03c0|\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)-\\\\log p_{f}(\\\\pi|\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}) can be viewed as a loss term for Fisher information.

The process for generating testing views in the Waymo dataset is straightforward; we translate the camera by 2 to 3 meters or rotate it by 10 to 15 degrees horizontally. However, the design for LLFF and Mip-NeRF 360 is not as straightforward, as we aim to construct extrapolated views that have ground truth images. For this reason, we cannot generate trajectories freely; instead, we need to create partitions for the testing and training sets. We present visualizations of the training and testing cameras in Fig.\\u00a08 from these scenes to illustrate the design of the extrapolated views. For some scenes where obvious extrapolated trajectories cannot be directly extracted, we aim to make the training views sparse in order to produce relative extrapolated trajectories.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLLFF\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfern\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhorns\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nleaves\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfortress\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntrex\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMip-NeRF 360\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngarden\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstump\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbicycle\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncounter\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nkitchen\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 8: Design of Training and Testing Views Design.

In this subsection, we provide a comparison between using the uncertainty mask from [7] as guidance and our certainty mask as guidance. Specifically, for rendered uncertain masks \\u2133c\\u00af\\\\mathcal{M}^{\\\\bar{c}}, we use 1\\u2212\\u2133c\\u00af1-\\\\mathcal{M}^{\\\\bar{c}} as guidance to experiment on Garden in Mip-NeRF 360.

In this subsection, we present an ablation study for this component on Garden in Mip-NeRF 360. As shown in Tab.\\u00a08, although removing the affine transform slightly improves PSNR, it results in a decrease in SSIM and LPIPS. Furthermore, as illustrated in Fig.\\u00a012, removing the affine transform results in large floaters in testing views, which can significantly lower human sensory preference.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNVS-Solver [45]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFreeFix\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 11: Comparisons on FreeFix and NVS-Solver.

These processes are characterised by a high degree of uncertainty coupled with demands of logistical flexibility, which traditionally implies the requirement for expensive reprogramming and reconfiguration of robots. This is of interest in domains such as nuclear decommissioning, robotic disassembly of complex products for recycling and re-use, and even areas such as robotic surgery or demolition with robotised demolition equipment. Nonetheless, challenges exist in automated planning and task execution for destructive operations. Whereas manufacturing paradigms centre around achieving high dimensional tolerances and precise control on a known workpiece, for disassembly, the precise location of cutting is less important (few mm as opposed to \\u03bc\\\\mum) while the precise sequence of cutting operations may not be known in advance. This uncertainty has motivated various approaches to robotic cutting, consisting of goal-conditioned trial-and-error & revision [25, 26], 3D reconstruction & planning [9], and online learning & adaptation [18, 22].\\n\\n\\nReinforcement learning (RL) has been applied with success to a variety of contact-rich tasks [2, 23], including robotic cutting [31, 15], particularly with difficult-to-model environments with complex robot-environment interactions, but are nonetheless data intensive. Whereas simulation environments offer reduced complexity and overhead of data collection, differences between simulated and physical cutting processes limit the applicability of adaptive methods to real-world tasks. Examples of such differences include motor backlash, tool wear, chattering, cross-domain mismatch of process and model parameters and other disturbances. These differences motivate the use of domain adaptation methods to align representations or behaviours across domains with minimal real-world supervision. These can be broadly separated into unified feature representation learning, model-based correction, and model-free synthesis of target domain examples.\\n\\n\\nDomain adaptive methods include [29] in which policies are trained on a cross-domain latent feature representation by aligning source and target domain distributions. A related concept applied to milling was proposed in [31] based on a cross-domain meta-model, trained on pairwise unified feature representations. Similarly, adversarial losses using domain discriminators have been employed for cross-domain tool wear classification [20]. Reconstruction-based methods have also been employed to jointly model observation and class distributions[12]; this concept has been further developed based on conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs) [33] wherein CVAE feature representations were used to train an RL policy, while feature representations are aligned across domains.\\n\\n\\nModel-based approaches have previously also been employed for domain adaptation, wherein a source domain task model is augmented with a corrective model based on physics-informed approaches [24], neural networks [13, 5] or Gaussian process (GP) models [19, 27] learned from target domain data. In our previous work, [16] we proposed an imitation learning framework in which a GP corrective model was learned from multiple cutting demonstrations. Nonetheless, model-based approaches incur limitations of modelling assumptions under which the models are introduced, and incur a dataset overhead, particularly for deep predictive modelling approaches.\\n\\n\\nRelating to the aforementioned approaches is direct alignment of observations across domains via translation or generative models. In the context of milling, [4] proposed a domain adaptation method for condition monitoring of different milling tools based on a generative CNN. Similarly, [30], proposed a domain adaptive imitation learning framework from visual demonstrations based on CycleGAN [32]. Generation at object level has also been proposed [17] wherein a StyleGAN image translation model is trained object-wise on weakly-paired cross-domain datasets for 6D pose estimation. CVAEs have also been employed for domain adaptation via synthesis of novel target domain examples [28].\\n\\n\\nNeural style transfer has been extensively researched in the context of image processing [11, 10]. Recently, this concept has been extended to motion execution. Thus far, its application has been limited largely to expressive stylised motions mirroring that of human operators [8, 7]. Nonetheless, its applicability to synthesise novel trajectories with characteristics of diverse human operators presents a compelling case for its application to other domain adaptation problems. Recently, this has been applied for dataset augmentation tasks [6]. A limitation of the aforementioned methods is lack of a suitable pairing mechanism for style and content, as well as lack of feature extractor backbones prevalent in image processing tasks. For transfer learning, addressed this problem [3] by building on the concept of conditional adversarial domain adaptation [21] to achieve feature-level style transfer for transfer learning. Nonetheless, adversarial alignment can be difficult to train, with well-known problems of mode collapse and vanishing gradients. Whereas these developments have been applied to time series classification problems, application of style transfer for RL policy transfer is, to the best of our knowledge, largely unexplored.\\n\\n\\nThis paper extends our previous example-based approach for sim-to-real adaptation to arbitrary real world examples. As with our previous work, our approach does not require re-training of classifiers or encoder networks to adapt to new scenarios (different disturbance forces, differing sensor dynamics, etc.). In contrast to prior work that applies neural style transfer primarily for stylised motion synthesis or dataset augmentation, we apply it as a trajectory-level domain adaptation mechanism for robotic skill transfer. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a latent-space pairing mechanism for content and style that operates without paired examples or retraining; (2) a novel transfer framework based on neural style transfer that does not require labelled or reward-supervised data from the target domain; and (3) empirical evaluation on robotic cutting, a task where conventional reinforcement learning pipelines are difficult to apply due to the absence of reward signal in the real-world deployment environment. An overview of our framework is provided in Figure 1.\\n\\n\\nFigure 1: Overview of proposed framework. In the first stage, a simulation of cutting mechanics is used to generate an expert policy and a variational autoencoder (VAE) is trained on simulated trajectory windows. In the second stage, the VAE encoded representations are used to generate pairings between a simulated and real world dataset which are used as style targets. Finally, expert trajectories are used to train a learner target domain policy with the generated observation windows.\\n\\n\", \"Style transfer framework\": \"\\nStyle transfer framework\\n\\nVariational autoencoder\\n\\nThe variational autoencoder (VAE) consists of two neural networks: an encoder q\\u03d5\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc9b|\\ud835\\udc99)q_{\\\\phi}(\\\\boldsymbol{z}|\\\\boldsymbol{x}) that approximates the posterior over latent variables \\ud835\\udc9b\\u2208\\u211dL\\\\boldsymbol{z}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{L}, and a decoder p\\u03b8\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc99|\\ud835\\udc9b)p_{\\\\theta}(\\\\boldsymbol{x}|\\\\boldsymbol{z}) that reconstructs the data from the latent representation.

Training was carried out with the Adam optimiser, with model hyperparameters established via manual search, reported in Table Style transfer. Both encoder and decoder networks were implemented as strided convolutional networks with 3 layers. Batch normalisation was further employed to accelerate convergence and reduce training instability. The encoder architecture is visualised in Figure 2.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: Overview of VAE encoder architecture; layer indices for style transfer are demarcated.\\n\\n\\nThe VAE training dataset consisted of a mixture of 680 on-policy and off-policy simulated trajectories. We consider a trajectory as a multivariate time series of length TT which comprises a sequence of state-action pairs:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u03c4={(\\ud835\\udc99t,\\ud835\\udc9at)}t=1T\\\\tau=\\\\{(\\\\boldsymbol{x}_{t},\\\\boldsymbol{y}_{t})\\\\}_{t=1}^{T}\\n\\n(4)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udc99t\\u2208\\u211dNS\\\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{N_{S}}, \\ud835\\udc9at\\u2208\\u211dNA\\\\boldsymbol{y}_{t}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{N_{A}} are the states, actions at time tt respectively. Each trajectory \\u03c4\\\\tau is divided into overlapping windows of length NN, resulting in a set of state and action windows:\\n\\n\\n\\nx(i)=\\\\displaystyle x^{(i)}=\\n[xt,xt+1,\\u2026,xt+N]\\u2208\\u211dN\\u00d7NS\\\\displaystyle[x_{t},x_{t+1},\\\\dots,x_{t+N}]\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\times N_{S}}\\n\\n(5)\\n\\n\\n\\ny(i)=\\\\displaystyle y^{(i)}=\\n[yt,yt+1,\\u2026,yt+N]\\u2208\\u211dN\\u00d7NA\\\\displaystyle[y_{t},y_{t+1},\\\\dots,y_{t+N}]\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\times N_{A}}\\n\\n(6)\\n\\n\\nThe window width NN and latent code dimensionality emerge as tunable parameters for which a trade-off exists between the temporal context afforded to the model, reproduction accuracy and saliency of the latent space. Through preliminary experiments, this was reflected in increased RMS error of the autoencoder reconstructions and reduced average cosine similarity between simulated and real world embeddings with increasing NN and dimensionality respectively. A window size of N=100N=100 samples (2 seconds) was identified as providing the best trade-off between these factors.\\n\\n\\n\\nPolicy adaptation\\n\\nWe adopt a similar approach to our previous work [16] to adapt a pre-trained policy to observations synthesised from unlabelled target domain data. In this procedure, an \\u201cexpert\\u201d policy \\u03c0e\\\\pi_{e} is initially trained in a simulation environment with a physically-informed cutting model, as introduced in our previous work [14], with model parameters from Table Style transfer. The expert was trained initially for 32000 episodes using the proximal policy optimisation (PPO) algorithm with domain randomisation of material properties. A translation function f:\\u211dN\\u00d7NS\\u2192\\u211dN\\u00d7NAf:\\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\times N_{S}}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\times N_{A}} is applied to each state window:\\n\\n\\n\\nx(g,i)\\u2063\\u2217=f\\u200b(x(c,i))x^{(g,i)*}=f(x^{(c,i)})\\n\\n(7)\\n\\n\\nand translated states paired with the corresponding expert action on x(c)x^{(c)} to generate a labelled dataset\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9f={(x(g,i),\\u03c0e\\u200b(x(c,i)))}.\\\\mathcal{D}=\\\\{(x^{(g,i)},\\\\pi_{e}(x^{(c,i)}))\\\\}.\\n\\n(8)\\n\\n\\nWe subsequently train a target domain policy \\u03c0g\\\\pi_{g}, initialised as \\u03c0g=\\u03c0e\\\\pi_{g}=\\\\pi_{e} on \\ud835\\udc9f\\\\mathcal{D} using behavioural cloning. We note this procedure can be extended to alternative imitation learning algorithms (such as DAgger) provided ff can be inferred during generation of source windows x(c,i)x^{(c,i)}. Under the assumption that the environment satisfies the Markov property, the policy learning process is unaffected by the windowing procedure. As the full trajectories do not need to be reconstructed, limitations of other methods such as requirement for blending or enforcing temporal consistency are inapplicable to this work [7]. Furthermore, as each trajectory is decomposed into T\\u2212N+1T-N+1 windows, the windowing approach has the effect of significantly augmenting the training data.\\n\\n\\n\\nStyle transfer\\n\\nIn this work, we consider neural style transfer[11] as a translation function wherein x(g)\\u2063\\u2217x^{(g)*} arise from solving the style transfer optimisation problem:\\n\\n\\n\\nx(g,i)\\u2063\\u2217=arg\\u2061minx(g,i)\\u2061(wc\\u200bLc\\u200b(x,x(c,i))+ws\\u200bLs\\u200b(x,x(s,j)))x^{(g,i)*}=\\\\arg\\\\min_{x^{(g,i)}}\\\\left(w_{c}L_{c}(x,x^{(c,i)})+w_{s}L_{s}(x,x^{(s,j)})\\\\right)\\n\\n(9)\\n\\n\\nwhere wcw_{c} and wsw_{s} are the content and style weights, respectively and LcL_{c}, LsL_{s} are content and style loss contributions respectively. The content loss is defined as:\\n\\n\\n\\nLc=\\u2211l\\u2211i,j12\\u200bNl\\u200b(Fi\\u200bj(c,l)\\u2212Fi\\u200bj(g,l))2L_{c}=\\\\sum_{l}\\\\sum_{i,j}\\\\frac{1}{2N_{l}}\\\\left(F^{(c,l)}_{ij}-F^{(g,l)}_{ij}\\\\right)^{2}\\n\\n(10)\\n\\n\\nwhere F(c,l)F^{(c,l)}, F(g,l)F^{(g,l)} are the feature outputs of layer ll for the content and generated output respectively. The style loss similarly is expressed as\\n\\n\\n\\nLs=\\u2211l\\u2211i,j14\\u200bNl2\\u200bMl2\\u200b(Gi\\u200bj(s,l)\\u2212Gi\\u200bj(g,l))2L_{s}=\\\\sum_{l}\\\\sum_{i,j}\\\\frac{1}{4N^{2}_{l}M^{2}_{l}}\\\\left(G^{(s,l)}_{ij}-G^{(g,l)}_{ij}\\\\right)^{2}\\n\\n(11)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udc06(s,l)\\\\mathbf{G}^{(s,l)} is the style Gram matrix of layer ll outputs F(s,l)F^{(s,l)}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc06(s,l)=F(s,l)\\u200bF\\ud835\\uddb3\\u200b(s,l)\\\\mathbf{G}^{(s,l)}=F^{(s,l)}F^{\\\\mathsf{T}(s,l)}\\n\\n(12)\\n\\n\\nand similarly for \\ud835\\udc06(c,l)\\\\mathbf{G}^{(c,l)}. The generated windows were initialised as\\n\\n\\n\\nx(g,i)=x(c,i)x^{(g,i)}=x^{(c,i)}\\n\\n(13)\\n\\n\\nand (9) optimised by gradient descent using the Adam optimiser. The relative content-style weighting wc/w\\u200bsw_{c}/w{s} was tuned manually through a grid-search procedure. Figure 3 shows the effect of content-style weighting on their relative loss contributions. At low values of wc/w\\u200bsw_{c}/w{s}, the total loss is dominated by increasing content reconstruction error; the generated windows diverge substantially from the original windows with marginal effect on style reconstruction. Hence, wc/w\\u200bsw_{c}/w{s} was reduced until diminishing returns on the (unweighted) style reconstruction loss was observed. We report relevant optimisation parameters in Table Style transfer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 3: Effect of content-style weight ratio wc/wlw_{c}/w_{l} on normalised (unweighted) content-style loss, averaged over 5 content-style batches (batch size 256), with chosen value wc/ws=0.02w_{c}/w_{s}=0.02 indicated (dotted line). Decreasing ratio results in diminishing returns on style while diverging substantially from the original content windows. Increasing ratio tends towards identity (generated windows correspond to unaltered simulated windows).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 1: Selected hyperparameters for encoder network and style transfer framework.\\n\\n\\n\\nParameter\\nValue\\n\\n\\nEncoder learning rate\\n1\\u00d710\\u221231\\\\times 10^{-3}\\n\\n\\nEncoder output channels\\n[128,256,512]\\\\left[128,256,512\\\\right]\\n\\n\\nEncoder kernel size\\n3\\n\\n\\nEncoder batch size\\n128\\n\\n\\nEncoder kernel stride\\n2\\n\\n\\nWindow size\\n100\\n\\n\\nLatent dimensions\\n130\\n\\n\\nContent-style ratio wc/wsw_{c}/w_{s}\\n\\n0.02\\n\\n\\nStyle transfer learning rate\\n0.01\\n\\n\\nStyle transfer iterations\\n1000\\n\\n\\nContent layer indices (Fig. 2)\\n[x]\\n\\n\\nStyle layer indices (Fig. 2)\\n[2, 5, 7]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 4: Convergence plot for style transfer optimisation with parameters from Table Style transfer for a batch of 256 content-style pairings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 2: Table of model parameters for cutting simulation (source domain)\\n\\n\\n\\nParameter\\nValue\\n\\n\\nPitch angle [rad]\\n0.126\\n\\n\\nHelix angle [rad]\\n0.0\\n\\n\\nRadius [m]\\n0.025\\n\\n\\nCutter width [m]\\n0.0005\\n\\n\\nCutting elements (flutes)\\n50\\n\\n\\nSpindle speed [rpm]\\n1000\\n\\n\\nMaterial cutting\\n\\n\\n\\n-mechanistic constant (KcK_{c}) [N/mm2]\\nvariable\\n\\n\\nMaterial edge\\n\\n\\n\\n-mechanistic constant (KeK_{e}) [N/mm]\\nvariable\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 5: t-SNE embedding diagram of content-style pairings. The points are coloured according to their class (simulation, blue / real world, red) with intensity according to the cosine similarity of their closest match, diverging from 0.5. The area of each real world embedding point is directly proportional to the number of times the corresponding window was matched.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA compelling advantage of encoder or classifier-based approaches is that they operate on unpaired cross-domain datasets. To improve the realism of generated trajectories, we employ a pairing mechanism that takes advantage of the unsupervised feature representations learned from the source domain data to generate weakly paired content and style windows. An intuitive analogue would be matching images with similar composition and subjects, reminiscent of the weak paring mechanism in [17]. In the first stage, the real world dataset is encoded in entirety by the encoder network to generate a dataset of embeddings. In the second stage, the simulated content window(s) are encoded and a content-style pairing matrix is constructed by the pairwise cosine similarity between x(c,i)x^{(c,i)}, x(s,j)x^{(s,j)} representations as\\n\\n\\n\\nSi\\u200bj=zi\\u22c5zj\\u2016zi\\u2016\\u22c5\\u2016zj\\u2016S_{ij}=\\\\frac{z_{i}\\\\cdot z_{j}}{||z_{i}||\\\\cdot||z_{j}||}\\n\\n(14)\\n\\n\\nIn the last stage, the closest match real embedding is paired with the simulated embedding. For each row ii, the index of the most similar pairing was obtained by:\\n\\n\\n\\nj\\u2217\\u200bi=arg\\u2061max\\u2061j,Si\\u200bjj^{*}i=\\\\arg\\\\max{j},S_{ij}\\n\\n(15)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor windows where the pairing diverged substantially from the content, the optimisation process introduced mean shifts into the observations, as well as introducing artefacts from the encoding process. Following the intuition of [10], qualitatively, we observed that pre-aligning the means of the content and style windows resulted in higher quality generated outputs. Figure 5 shows a representation of the content-style pairings generated by the pairing procedure. The data show the formation of distinct clusters according to simulated and real world trajectories. Unsurprisingly, the real world embeddings with the most matches were found predominantly at the intersections of the clusters. This parasitic behaviour is reminiscent of the mode-collapse phenomenon in generative-adversarial networks. Nonetheless, around 50% of real world points were matched at least once, with matched windows dispersed throughout the latents, indicating good coverage of the real world dataset.\\n\\n\\nFor adaptation, 50 episodic trajectories were collected in source domain with the expert policy, which formed the content dataset. For this work, the style dataset consisted of 148 off-policy trajectories collected from the real world. We note this is not a hard requirement; dataset size is motivated primarily by avoiding breakdown of the pairing and style transfer mechanism where content and style windows diverge substantially.\\n\\n\\n\\nExperimental setup\\n\\nAs with our previous work, experimental validation was carried out on a KUKA LBR iiwa R820 14kg collaborative robot equipped with a wrist-mounted motorised slitting saw tool. The iiwa was connected via the Fast Research Interface (FRI) to a Robot Operating System (ROS) workstation with a communication frequency of 500Hz. The workstation consisted of an Intel i7-8086K CPU, NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti GPU with 11GB VRAM, and 32GB RAM. The robot was equipped with a motorised slitting saw tool; whereas geometric parameters of the tool reflect the training parameters in Table Style transfer, the number of teeth was doubled to introduce further cross-domain mismatch.\\n\\n\\nThe cutting task was represented as a single conventional milling pass over an material with variable geometry, following a nominal trajectory defined at the material surface. As proof of principle, the reference path was defined manually with respect to the surface for all case studies. During the cutting task, the policy provides as output a translational stiffness, incremental offset to the depth of cut (DoC), and the feed rate, relative to the planned (nominal) trajectory.

To demonstrate the performance of each method on a range of materials, cutting trials were carried out on polyurethane foam, cardboard, corrugated plastic, mica and aluminium. We further establish 3 separate case studies on each material to evaluate the policy performance under different path planning conditions. We evaluate each method by task completion time, average path deviation, average tool load, material removed volume (MRV), and similarity of the adopted action trajectories to the source domain expert actions, averaged over 5 trials per material for each strategy, and aggregated over all materials. To mitigate effects of drift (e.g. tool wear, temperature, calibration errors), trials for each strategy were interleaved.\\n\\n\\nComparison methods\\n\\nFor the subsequent real world experiments, we adopt the following terminology to denote comparison methods: \\u2018Expert\\u2019 refers to the unadapted source simulation expert policy, as transferred directly to the real world task. \\u2018BC\\u2019, or standalone behavioural cloning, represents our previous work, in which the simulation is augmented with a Gaussian process (GP) regression model trained on aligned demonstrations from 14 preliminary experiments on aluminium and mica. \\u2018CVAE\\u2019 represents a conditional variational autoencoder using the same real world dataset as adopted for style transfer. Note in this instance, the encoder itself is trained on the entire dataset of both real world and simulation data, conditioned on a one-hot domain label (simulation or real world). Simulated data are encoded as with the style transfer approach, however, at decoding time, the one-hot class label is swapped to generate a synthetic window of the desired class. \\u2018CycleGAN\\u2019 is also introduced as a comparison method. In this instance, the surrogate real world dataset is synthesised by the sim-to-real generator network. With all methods, the generator / encoder architecture was chosen equivalent to Table Style transfer. For CycleGAN, a smaller discriminator network, with output channels [64,128,256][64,128,256] was used due to mitigate the well-known \\u2018vanishing gradient\\u2019 problem during GAN training. All other hyperparameters were chosen to be equivalent to the CycleGAN study. All methods were employed with behavioural cloning as per the self-supervision procedure introduced in this work. Additionally, as a benchmark, we include a \\u201cbaseline\\u201d strategy in which the process parameters are held constant at the nominal feed rate (0.75m/min) and depth of cut of 1 mm, applied to all materials.\\n\\n\\n\\nPlanar material case study\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) Flat\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) DoC offset\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(c) Curved\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 7: Boxplot summary of performance metrics for the style transfer trained policy and comparison methods, aggregated over all materials. Metrics include task completion time, average path deviation, average load force, average (normalised) dynamic time warping (DTW) distance between each strategy and the simulation expert policy (lower better), and material removed volume (MRV, higher better).\\n\\n\\nEach strategy was initially tested on a planar material, with the reference path calibrated at the material surface. For the calibration procedure, the surface was modelled as a warped plane interpolated between 4 corner points obtained via guarded move with a force threshold of 1N, with the exception of foam, where contact was confirmed visually. The performance of each strategy for the planar case study is outlined in Figure 7(a). To aid interpretation, the significance of the difference in metrics was tested via one-way ANOVA. The normality and homoscedasticity assumptions of ANOVA were tested via the Shapiro-Wilk and Levene methods respectively. A significance level of \\u03b1=0.05\\\\alpha=0.05 was used for all tests. Metrics that did not satisfy the assumptions were transformed via Box-Cox transform:\\n\\n\\n\\ny={x\\u03bb\\u22121if\\u200b\\u03bb\\u22600log\\u2061(x)otherwisey=\\\\begin{cases}x^{\\\\lambda}-1&\\\\mathrm{if}\\\\,\\\\lambda\\\\neq 0\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\log(x)&\\\\mathrm{otherwise}\\\\end{cases}\\n\\n(18)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u03bb\\\\lambda is chosen to maximise the log-likelihood of the transformed data under a normality assumption. In the case of completion time and average force, the assumptions of ANOVA were satisfied (Shapiro p=0.361p=0.361, p=0.355p=0.355; Levene p=0.0689p=0.0689, p=0.0983p=0.0983, respectively). Average path deviation and MRV did not satisfy the normality assumption after transformation, and in this case the Kruskal-Wallis test was adopted without transformation. For both task completion time and average force, one-way ANOVA revealed significant effects of strategy on performance (F=61.1F=61.1, p=1.14\\u00d710\\u221227p=1.14\\\\times 10^{-27}; F=6.74F=6.74, p=6.52\\u00d710\\u22125p=6.52\\\\times 10^{-5} respectively) between strategy and these performance metrics.\\n\\n\\nTo examine the effect of individual strategy on the performance metrics, the Tukey Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) was used for ANOVA, and the Dunn post-hoc test for Kruskal-Wallis. No significant difference in task completion times was found between style transfer and BC, whereas the former outperformed all other methods. Style transfer had the largest effect relative to GAN (\\u22121.00-1.00 s) and the smallest relative to the Expert (\\u22120.329-0.329 s). For path deviation, style transfer significantly differed from the Expert (\\u22121.50-1.50 mm, p=0.000196p=0.000196) and GAN (0.4510.451 mm, p=0.005074p=0.005074) strategies, however, results were inconclusive for BC (p=0.560p=0.560) and CVAE (p=0.109p=0.109). Style transfer was further found to significantly outperform the Expert and BC strategies in minimising average force (\\u22121.273-1.273 N, p=0.0001p=0.0001; \\u22120.651-0.651 N, p=0.0352p=0.0352), however, no significant difference was found between style transfer and the CVAE and GAN strategies (p=0.867p=0.867, p=0.611p=0.611). The choice of strategy was found to have no conclusive effect on MRV (Kruskal H=2.87H=2.87, p=0.578p=0.578). This result appears surprising in light of the differing action selection apparent for each strategy, particularly in DoC.\\n\\n\\nTo examine the effect of the adaptation methods on the agent actions, the actions taken during each trial were compared with 50 simulated experiments (i.e. source domain) carried out with the source domain expert, and the similarity of action trajectories evaluated by normalised dynamic time warping (DTW) distance. The strategies that adopt actions that are more broadly similar to the source domain expert will score lower on this metric than those that deviate substantially from the expert behaviour. The expert policy itself was included in this comparison since it is being applied to the target domain. We report effect sizes as Hedges\\u2019 gg. Clear differences between the strategies were indicated (Kruskal H=1930H=1930, p=0.0p=0.0), with style transfer yielding large improvements relative to the Expert g=0.875g=0.875 and GAN g=2.18g=2.18, a moderate improvement for CVAE g=0.575g=0.575 and a small reduction in performance relative to BC g=\\u22120.370g=-0.370. Post-hoc testing indicated a high significance level in these effects (p\\u22643.65\\u00d710\\u221217p\\\\leq 3.65\\\\times 10^{-17}) for all comparisons.\\n\\n\\nTo examine the behaviour of each strategy in more detail and enable qualitative comparisons between each strategy, the action trajectories adopted by each policy during an example trial on foam and mica are presented in Figure 8. From Figure 8(a), 8(d), 8(g), 8(j), the action trajectories were broadly similar between BC and style transfer across both materials. Style transfer adopts a more correct behaviour of reducing the feed rate prior to engagement with the material, as compared with BC. Conversely, the GAN policy diverges substantially from the expert behaviour which corroborates the DTW metric results. All adapted policies adopted a more consistent DoC throughout both trials than the unadapted expert policy. Differences between the policy behaviour on each material were mainly evident in the DoC behaviour, transverse stiffness (KxK_{x}) and, to a lesser extent, the normal stiffness (KzK_{z}).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFlat\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2005DoC offset\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2002\\u200aCurved\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) Foam - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) Foam - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(c) Foam - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(d) Foam - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(e) Foam - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(f) Foam - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(g) Mica - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(h) Mica - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(i) Mica - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(j) Mica - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(k) Mica - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(l) Mica - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 8: Comparison of agent actions for foam and mica for planar, DoC offset and curved case studies respectively. Actions include the relative to nominal feed rate adjustment, with 0 corresponding to no change and 1 to double the nominal feed rate, depth of cut (DoC), and controller stiffness in transverse, feed direction and normal directions respectively (Kp,xK_{p,x}, Kp,yK_{p,y}, Kp,zK_{p,z}. Units of KpK_{p} are chosen consistent with (16)).\\n\\n\\n\\nRobustness to path planning offset\\n\\nTo examine the robustness of the method to path planning errors - for example, due to errors in calibration, surface position estimation or noise, we further examine the performance of all strategies with a path planning offset of 1mm, inset into the ground truth material surface. The performance of each strategy was evaluated over 3 trials per strategy, per material.\\n\\n\\nSimilarly to the planar case, strategy significantly impacted task completion times (ANOVA F=17.0F=17.0, p=9.94\\u00d710\\u221210p=9.94\\\\times 10^{-10}); style transfer again differed significantly from all strategies except BC (Tukey HSD p=0.0694p=0.0694), and improvements over other strategies being similar to the planar case study, albeit more consistent across strategies (effect size range \\u22120.658-0.658-\\u22120.850-0.850 s). Whereas path deviation was also influenced by strategy (ANOVA F=4.61F=4.61, p=0.00235p=0.00235), post-hoc testing indicated only GAN differed significantly from the BC (p=0.0047p=0.0047) and Expert (p=0.0125p=0.0125) strategies. Although group means were more concentrated than in the planar case, path deviation was notably more consistent across trials for style transfer, CVAE, and GAN, implying these strategies were better able to tolerate the path planning offset and maintain stable path tracking across materials. MRV was again unaffected by strategy (Kruskal-Wallis H=2.61H=2.61, p=0.624p=0.624), and contrasting the planar case study, no significant differences were observed in average tool load (ANOVA F=1.06F=1.06, p=0.382p=0.382). Similarly to the planar case study, there was a clear separation between the strategies in terms of similarity to expert actions (Kruskal H=688H=688, p=9.33\\u00d710\\u2212148p=9.33\\\\times 10^{-148}). Post-hoc testing indicated style transfer was distinct from the comparison methods, with the least significant result being with CVAE (p=0.0314p=0.0314), small negative effects for BC g=\\u22120.321g=-0.321 and CVAE g=\\u22120.151g=-0.151 and positive effects relative to Expert g=0.682g=0.682 and GAN g=1.31g=1.31 strategies.\\n\\n\\nFigure 8(b), 8(e), 8(h), 8(k) shows the agent actions for the offset case study. All strategies exhibited a more sporadic DoC behaviour than the planar case study, with style transfer exhibiting the most consistent DoC behaviour across both materials, and matching more closely to the planar case study behaviour, supporting observations regarding the consistency of the path deviation. All strategies exhibited a more aggressive variation in stiffness relative to the planar case study, indicating a compensatory response to the offset cutting depth.\\n\\n\\n\\nNon-planar surfaces\\n\\nWe further showcase the performance of each strategy when both material and surface geometry are altered to varying degrees of curvature. Consistent with the planar case study, the reference path with respect to the surface was assumed already known; however, we note that numerous path-planning methods have been proposed in the context of milling, including the case where surface geometry is unknown [9]. For this case study, we assume the material is a thin plate under pure bending, with the surface modelled as a section of a truncated oblique cone \\u2013 in other words, an interpolation between two circular arcs. The arc parameters for each endpoint were derived from a 3-point estimation obtained similarly to the planar case study. Curvatures ranged between 2.36 m-1 and 4.04 m-1 across materials. Cardboard was excluded from the set of materials since the maximum curvature generated during preliminary experiments did not meaningfully differ from the previous case studies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) Polyurethane foam\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) Corrugated plastic\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(c) Mica\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(d) Aluminium\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 9: 3D plot of TCP paths adopted by each strategy with respect to the material surface - qualitative defects are shown in the \\u201cexpert\\u201d and \\u201cGAN\\u201d strategies, which exhibit transverse path deviations on the stiffer materials.\\n\\n\\nAs with the prior case studies, strategy had a significant effect on completion time (Kruskal H=38.5H=38.5, p=8.44\\u00d710\\u22128p=8.44\\\\times 10^{-8}) and in post-hoc testing, style transfer outperformed all strategies except BC (p=0.529p=0.529). The effect of style transfer largely reflected the planar case study, with \\u22121.00-1.00 s relative to GAN, and \\u22120.413-0.413 s relative to the Expert. Differences in path deviation were inconclusive compared to the planar case study, (Kruskal H=9.77H=9.77, p=0.0445p=0.0445) with the most significant result from post-hoc testing arising between GAN and style transfer (p=0.0589p=0.0589); however, differences in average force were more pronounced (ANOVA F=7.71F=7.71, p=0.000025p=0.000025), with style transfer significantly outperforming GAN (\\u22121.25-1.25 N, p=0.0001p=0.0001) but not the other strategies. Corroborating the previous case studies, MRV did not significantly differ between strategies (Kruskal H=2.15H=2.15, p=0.708p=0.708). Furthermore, action similarity again revealed clear separation between strategies (Kruskal H=1390H=1390, p=2.64\\u00d710\\u2212300p=2.64\\\\times 10^{-300}), with style transfer exhibiting the largest deviation from GAN (g=2.14g=2.14) and significant differences from all others (BC g=\\u22120.264g=-0.264, CVAE g=0.503g=0.503, Expert g=0.487g=0.487).\\n\\n\\nThe agent actions, as shown in Figure 8(c), 8(f), 8(i), 8(l), show similar behaviours to the offset case study, with differences in DoC behaviour becoming more pronounced, particularly for the expert policy. CycleGAN adopted a highly sporadic action profile in feed rate and stiffness, particularly for the foam trials. A hypothesis for this behaviour is that the curved material presents a more challenging case for the agent and the much lower cutting forces limit information available to the agent to make decisions. Therefore, the actions resemble those at the beginning of the planar trials in which the agent is in free space and has no information about the contact state or tool engagement. Style transfer and BC both exhibited less consistent DoC behaviour than the planar case studies on foam, however, produced smoother action trajectories that were strongly correlated to the engagement state - for example, contact initiation was well-demarcated for both strategies.\\n\\n\\nFigure 9 shows a representative example of the 3D TCP positions adopted by each strategy for a single cutting trial. The TCP trajectories adopted exhibited clear defects for the expert and GAN trials, which were evident across both low and high stiffness materials. On the low stiffness materials, such as in Figure 9(a) these were evident as low-frequency irregularities, resembling a random walk, whereas for the high stiffness materials, this was exhibited as a higher frequency \\u201cwobble\\u201d, which were unrelated to known phenomena such as chattering. These defects were suppressed or entirely absent during the BC, CVAE and style transfer trials, with these methods yielding similar qualitative improvements across all materials.\\n\\n\\n\", \"Discussion\": \"\\nDiscussion\\n\\nFor the cutting task, the proposed method was evaluated based on task completion times, average path deviation, tool load (average force), material removed volume, behavioural similarity to expert action trajectories in source domain, and qualitatively by the action trajectories, ability to maintain consistent cutting conditions (e.g. depth of cut), as well as TCP trajectories. Relative to the comparison methods \\u2013 consisting of the unadapted source domain expert policy (Expert), our previous work (BC), conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) and CycleGAN (generative adversarial network) \\u2013 the proposed method based on style transfer consistently achieved significant reductions in task completion time across all case studies. Compared to BC and CVAE, style transfer showed comparative performance but did not uniformly surpass them across all metrics.\\n\\n\\nThe reduced influence of strategy in the offset path case study is consistent with the constraint imposed by insetting the path into the material, which limits the ability of the agent to regulate the true DoC. It also implies a common limitation of these methods in modelling out-of-distribution task conditions, wherein offsetting the reference path and nominal feed rate introduces concept shift in the optimal actions across domains in addition to covariate shift in the observations. Although path deviation was more consistent across style transfer, CVAE and GAN strategies than for BC and the expert policy, overall improvements were primarily inconclusive. It is plausible that the inconclusive effects may be attributable to the reduced number of samples for the offset case study.\\n\\n\\nQualitatively, the style transfer trained policy demonstrated improved behavioural stability relative to the model-free approaches, with smoother action trajectories and more consistent control of depth-of-cut and stiffness, which was robust to perturbations in surface geometry and cutting path, and corroborated by higher action similarity to the source domain expert relative to all strategies except BC. The irregular path deviations observed in the TCP trajectories were attributable to the largely sporadic action trajectories of the expert policy, and, to a lesser extent, the GAN strategy. For the stiffer materials, deviations in the path are caused by contact instabilities resulting from interaction between the policy stiffness and the environment stiffness. These behaviours were largely absent with the BC, CVAE and style transfer strategies.\\n\\n\\nWe hypothesise that the poorer performance of CycleGAN-based domain adaptation arises from its limited capacity to preserve task-relevant structure in the translated observations, which has been documented in related work [1]. While CycleGAN has been effective in visual domains where semantic content remains invariant under style changes\\u2014e.g. image-to-image translation, its application to time-series control tasks may disrupt temporal dependencies or distort dynamics-critical features, leading to degraded policy performance.\\n\\n\", \"Conclusion\": \"\\nConclusion\\n\\nAn example-based approach for sim-to-real transfer in robotic control was proposed based on the principle of neural style transfer. Empirical results on a robotic cutting task demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable or superior performance to our previous work, conditional variational autoencoders, and CycleGAN-based time series translation across diverse materials and geometric scenarios, while substantially relaxing the assumptions of our previous example-based work. The proposed method is sample-efficient, demonstrated with 148 off-policy real world trajectories versus 32000 for initial policy training, and avoids the need for training domain discriminator, generator or corrective models, a crucial limitation of previously proposed adaptation methods.\\n\\n\\nWe note the limitation that this work does not explicitly address differing cross-domain target (action) distributions or compatibility of generated trajectories with robot kinematic and dynamic constraints. We posit such constraints could be formulated as part of the optimisation process wherein physical feasibility losses are jointly optimised with style and content losses, and represents a possible extension of this work. Additionally, the quality of generated trajectories and pairings is expected to deteriorate with low coverage of real-world examples, weak content-style match similarity, or parasitic matching where a small subset of real trajectories dominate the pairing.\\n\\n\", \"Data availability\": \"\\nData availability\\n\\nThe datasets generated during and/or analysed during the current study are available in the Figshare repository, DOI 10.6084/m9.figshare.28983659.\\n\\n\", \"Funding Declaration\": \"\\nFunding Declaration\\n\\nThis work was supported by the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) project \\u201cResearch and Development of a Highly Automated and Safe Streamlined Process for Increase Lithium-ion Battery Repurposing and Recycling\\u201d (REBELION) under Grant 101104241.\\n\\n\", \"Acknowledgements\": \"\\nAcknowledgements\\n\\nThe authors would further like to acknowledge Abdelaziz Wasfy Shaarawy, Carl Meggs and Christopher Gell respectively for assistance with experimental validation, design of material holder and cutter tool for experiments herein.\\n\\n\", \"Author contributions\": \"\\nAuthor contributions\\n\\nConceptualisation - A.R. and J.H.; data curation - J.H.; formal analysis - J.H.; funding acquisition - A.R. and R.S.; investigation - J.H.; methodology - J.H. and A.R.; project administration - A.R. and R.S.; software - J.H.; resources - J.H., A.R. and R.S.; supervision - A.R. and R.S.; validation - J.H. and A.R.; visualisation - J.H.; writing (original draft) - J.H.; writing (review & editing) - J.H. and A.R. and R.S.\\n\\n\", \"Competing interests\": \"\\nCompeting interests\\n\\nThe authors declare no competing interests.\\n\\n\"}, \"bibliography\": {\"[1]\": \"\\n[1]\\nH.

naturally reason about object functionality, identify the relevant functional element (e.g., a heater knob or thermostat), and interact with it using an appropriate body configuration.\\nHowever, performing such functionally-correct interactions in a novel 3D environment remains challenging for embodied intelligent agents, as it requires a holistic understanding of scene semantics and the human actions that the environment affords\\u00a0[7, 4].\\nIn this work, we investigate to generate realistic and functional interactions between a 3D human body and a novel scene, conditioned on open-vocabulary task descriptions.\\nAn effective solution to this problem benefits a wide range of applications, including embodied AI, robotics, game production, and video generation, among many others.\\n\\n\\nThe synthesis of 3D human-scene interaction (HSI) has been extensively studied, with existing methods broadly falling into two paradigms.\\nData-driven approaches learn generative models from paired 3D interaction data, achieving high visual fidelity and realistic human poses in controlled settings.\\nFor example, COINS\\u00a0[47] models human body poses conditioned on scene geometry and text commands, while TriDi\\u00a0[29] learns a joint distribution over human pose, object geometry, and interaction signals using diffusion models.\\nDespite their effectiveness, such methods rely on large-scale, high-quality paired interaction datasets and typically require explicit interaction specifications (e.g., \\u201csitting on a sofa\\u201d), limiting their ability to generalize to diverse novel scenes.\\nTo alleviate data dependency, recent work has explored zero-shot or training-free pipelines that leverage pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to generate human-scene interactions.\\nRepresentative examples include GenZI\\u00a0[18], which reconstructs 3D human bodies from multi-view image synthesis, and GenHSI\\u00a0[20], which integrates image-based object grounding with 3D body fitting from a single input image.\\nWhile these methods improve flexibility and support open-vocabulary task prompts, they are primarily effective for general human-scene interactions describing physical relations or motions, e.g., \\u201csitting on a sofa\\u201d or \\u201cwalking on a bridge\\u201d.\\n\\n\\nIn contrast, many real-world tasks like \\u201copen the window\\u201d involve interactions at a functional level, where a human must identify and interact with fine-grained functional elements in the 3D scene to complete the task, such as finding and contacting a window handle to open a window, as shown in Fig.\\u00a01.\\nWe refer to this setting as functional human-scene interaction.\\nThis problem poses fundamental challenges, as it requires reasoning about both the semantics of functional elements in 3D scenes and the 3D human poses needed to establish appropriate contacts.\\nExisting methods typically lack explicit reasoning about object functionality and the corresponding human-scene contact, leading to interactions that are either geometrically implausible or functionally incorrect.\\n\\n\\nIn this work, we propose FunHSI, a training-free, functionality-driven\\nframework that enables functional human-scene interactions from\\nopen-vocabulary task prompts.\\nGiven a set of posed RGB-D images and a task prompt, FunHSI reasons about the functionality of the 3D scene and synthesizes a 3D human that interacts with the scene in a functionally correct manner to accomplish the specified task.\\nAs illustrated in Fig.\\u00a02, FunHSI is built upon three key components.\\nFirst, we introduce a functionality-aware contact reasoning module to identify task-relevant functional elements in the scene, reconstruct their 3D geometry, and infer high-level interaction patterns via contact graph reasoning.\\nThe resulting contact graph explicitly encodes the contact relationships between the human body and both functional and supporting scene elements, serving as a structured representation that bridges high-level task intent and low-level physical interaction.\\nSecond, we propose a functionality-aware body initialization module that synthesizes a human performing the task in the image and estimates the corresponding initial 3D body and hand poses.\\nTo mitigate hallucinations during human synthesis, we introduce a human inpainting optimization strategy that automatically evaluates and improves the generated human pose configuration.\\nIn addition, since image-based synthesis may produce left-right hand inconsistencies with the inferred contact graph, we further refine the contact graph to align contact specifications with the synthesized human.\\nFinally, a body refinement module places the initialized 3D human into the scene and performs stage-wise optimization to jointly refine body pose and human-scene contacts, ensuring both physical plausibility and functional correctness.\\n\\n\\nWe conduct experiments on the SceneFun3D dataset\\u00a0[4] under both functional and general human-scene interaction settings.\\nExtensive qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our design and the superior performance of our framework compared to existing baselines.\\nIn addition, we show that FunHSI is compatible with recent feed-forward 3D reconstruction methods, such as MapAnything\\u00a0[15], and can generate realistic human-scene interactions in reconstructed city scenes.\\nIn summary, our contributions are as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nWe propose FunHSI, a training-free framework that generates functionally correct human-scene interactions from open-vocabulary task prompts. FunHSI extends beyond general interactions to support functional interaction scenarios across diverse scenes and actions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nWe introduce a robust optimization strategy for inpainting humans and contact graph refinement scheme, providing valuable insights for functional human-scene interactions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that FunHSI achieves strong performance in both functional and general HSI tasks compared to existing baselines. Additionally, FunHSI exhibits strong flexibility and generalization on realistic city scenes captured using smartphones.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"2 Related Work\": \"\\n\\n2 Related Work\\n\\nData-driven Human-scene Interaction Synthesis.\\nHuman-scene interaction (HSI) models how humans behave within 3D environments\\u00a0[46, 48, 41, 11, 13, 38], and many works focus on generating static interactions that place the human body into the scene\\u00a0[32, 19, 45, 10, 47, 11, 18, 20].\\nA conventional approach is to learn a generative model from paired data.\\nPLACE\\u00a0[44] employs a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to generate body-scene proximity conditioned on scene geometry, followed by body fitting to produce plausible interactions.\\nPOSA\\u00a0[10] predicts detailed body-scene contact relations via a graph-based CVAE.\\nCOINS\\u00a0[47] incorporates textual prompts to jointly generate pelvis placement and body pose for object-centric interactions.\\nA closely related research line addresses human-object interaction (HOI), particularly for interactions with small objects where accurate hand-object contact is essential\\u00a0[34, 37, 17, 6].\\nGOAL\\u00a0[34] and SAGA\\u00a0[37] first generate target grasping poses and then in-fill motions that reach these targets.\\nCG-HOI\\u00a0[6] explicitly enforces contact constraints to jointly model human and object motions.\\nDespite their effectiveness, existing data-driven HSI/HOI approaches rely on large-scale paired interaction data,\\n\\u00a0[9, 43, 1, 12, 13, 22].\\nThe cost and complexity of acquiring such high-quality multimodal data pose fundamental challenges to scalability and generalization.\\n\\n\\nZero-shot HSI Synthesis\\nTo overcome the data limitation, training-free methods that leverage pre-trained VLMs have been proposed.\\nGenZI\\u00a0[18] generates 3D bodies based on image generation models.\\nGiven a description of the task, human pixels are generated individually in tens of images, which are obtained by rendering the same 3D scene from different views.

Fig.\\u00a011) and are fixed across all experiments.\\nWe then prompt a large language model (LLM), e.g., GPT-4o\\u00a0[25] or Gemini, with the task description, the detected functional elements, the predefined body-part set, and additional structured instructions that encourage task-complete and human-like interactions.\\nThe LLM outputs a contact graph \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G}, which specifies the involved body parts, the functional and supporting scene elements, and their corresponding contact relations (see Fig.\\u00a02).\\nSimilar to functional elements, inferred supporting elements (e.g., the floor) are segmented in each image and lifted to 3D masks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3 Functionality-aware Body Initialization\\n\\nAlthough the inferred contact graph \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G} provides high-level interaction constraints, directly fitting a 3D human body to the scene remains challenging due to the strong sensitivity of optimization-based methods to initialization.\\nTo obtain a reliable initial body configuration, we first synthesize a human performing the task in the image and then estimate the corresponding 3D body and hand poses.\\nSince image-based synthesis may introduce left-right inconsistencies with the inferred contact graph, we update the contact graph to align its laterality with the initialized human body.\\n\\n\\nHuman inpainting with contact-aware reasoning.\\n\\nWe employ a vision-language model (VLM), specifically Gemini\\u00a0[2], to synthesize human pixels in the input image.\\nTo encourage the generated human to perform the specified task and establish appropriate contacts with the scene, we introduce a contact-aware prompting strategy.\\nIn addition to the input image without humans and the task description, the inpainting prompt incorporates the inferred contact graph and the detected object bounding boxes.\\nThese cues explicitly specify task-relevant functional and supporting elements, guiding the model to generate human body parts in spatial proximity to the target objects.\\nHowever, image inpainting models may hallucinate, unintentionally altering scene structures or introducing spurious objects, as illustrated in Fig.\\u00a03.\\nTo mitigate this issue, we adopt an iterative generator-critic scheme inspired by LLM-based optimization\\u00a0[40].\\nA separate Gemini model is used as a critic to compare the inpainted image with the original input and verify that (1) the generated human performs the specified task, (2) contacts with functional elements are plausible, and (3) no irrelevant or non-existent objects are introduced.\\nIf any criterion is violated, the generator is prompted to regenerate the human appearance.\\nThis process is repeated until all criteria are satisfied or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\\nIn practice, we find that 3-4 iterations are sufficient and outperform single-pass image generation.\\n\\n\\nFigure 3: Visualization of the human inpainting optimization process. By automatically evaluating the human inpainting results, the image generation process is optimized to produce more reliable outcomes, thus strongly facilitating the subsequent body optimization step.\\n\\n\\n\\n3D human estimation.\\n\\nGiven the human-inpainted image, we estimate SMPL-X parameters to initialize the 3D human body.\\nSpecifically, we estimate the global translation \\ud835\\udc2b\\\\mathbf{r}, root orientation \\ud835\\udf4b\\\\bm{\\\\varphi}, and body pose \\ud835\\udf3db\\\\bm{\\\\theta}^{b} using CameraHMR\\u00a0[26], and estimate hand pose parameters \\ud835\\udf3dh\\\\bm{\\\\theta}^{h} using WiLoR\\u00a0[30].\\nFor cases where the hands are occluded in the image, \\ud835\\udf3dh\\\\bm{\\\\theta}^{h} is initialized to the default relaxed hand pose of SMPL-X.\\nThe estimated SMPL-X body is then transformed from the camera coordinate system to the world coordinate system using the known camera pose, ensuring that the human body and the scene are represented in a common reference frame.\\nThe resulting SMPL-X parameters provide a task-specific and geometrically plausible initialization, which substantially simplifies the subsequent body refinement stage.\\n\\n\\n\\nContact graph refinement.\\n\\nWe observe that image generation models may fail to consistently capture left-right spatial relations.\\nFor example, as shown in Fig\\u00a09, the synthesized image may depict the left hand contacting a handle, even when the inferred contact graph specifies contact with the right hand.\\nSuch laterality inconsistencies between the initialized body configuration and the contact graph can lead to invalid human-scene interactions during subsequent refinement.\\nTo address this issue, we refine the contact graph by aligning its laterality with the inpainted image.\\nSpecifically, we project the left and right wrist joints of the estimated 3D body onto the 2D image plane and compute their distances to the center \\ud835\\udc1co\\\\mathbf{c}_{o} of the functional element bounding box:\\n\\n\\n\\ndleft=\\u2016\\u03a0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc30left)\\u2212\\ud835\\udc1co\\u20162,dright=\\u2016\\u03a0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc30right)\\u2212\\ud835\\udc1co\\u20162,d_{\\\\text{left}}=\\\\|\\\\Pi(\\\\mathbf{w}_{\\\\text{left}})-\\\\mathbf{c}_{o}\\\\|_{2},\\\\quad d_{\\\\text{right}}=\\\\|\\\\Pi(\\\\mathbf{w}_{\\\\text{right}})-\\\\mathbf{c}_{o}\\\\|_{2},\\n\\n(2)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u03a0\\u200b(\\u22c5)\\\\Pi(\\\\cdot) denotes the 3D-to-2D projection operator and\\n\\ud835\\udc30left,\\ud835\\udc30right\\\\mathbf{w}_{\\\\text{left}},\\\\mathbf{w}_{\\\\text{right}} are the 3D wrist joints.\\nIf dleft>dright+\\u03b4d_{\\\\text{left}}>d_{\\\\text{right}}+\\\\delta, where \\u03b4\\\\delta is a small tolerance to account for projection noise and pose estimation errors, we apply a symmetric left-right swap to all hand-related nodes in the contact graph \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G} (e.g., palm and finger nodes).\\nOtherwise, the contact graph remains unchanged.\\nThis simple distance-based criterion is effective at resolving left-right ambiguities across different scenes and camera viewpoints.\\nThe refined contact graph is denoted as \\ud835\\udca2\\u2217\\\\mathcal{G}^{*}.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4 Optimization-based Body Refinement\\n\\nTo refine the body pose, global configurations, and the contact, a conventional solution is to jointly optimize all SMPL-X parameters.\\nHowever, we find in our trials that such joint optimization often leads to unrealistic HSI results, such as unnatural facing orientation and penetration to the scene.\\nTherefore, we propose a two-stage coarse-to-fine optimization method to gradually refine the initial body state.\\nThis will not only preserve nuances in the initial body pose, but also improve the body-scene contact, making the 3D human body performing the specified task.\\n\\n\\nOptimization objective.\\n\\nTo penalize body-scene interpenetration, we define a collision loss based on the signed distance field (SDF) of the SMPL-X body.\\nGiven a scene point cloud \\ud835\\udcab={\\ud835\\udc29j}j=1N\\\\mathcal{P}=\\\\{\\\\mathbf{p}_{j}\\\\}_{j=1}^{N}, the collision loss is formulated as\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2112col=\\u2211j=1Nmax\\u2061(0,\\u2212\\u03a8\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc29j;\\u03b2,r,\\u03c6,\\u03b8)),\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{col}}=\\\\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\\\max\\\\bigl(0,\\\\;-\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{p}_{j};\\\\beta,r,\\\\varphi,\\\\theta)\\\\bigr),\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u03a8\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc29j;\\u03b2,r,\\u03c6,\\u03b8)\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{p}_{j};\\\\beta,r,\\\\varphi,\\\\theta) denotes the SDF value of point \\ud835\\udc29j\\\\mathbf{p}_{j} with respect to the current SMPL-X body configuration, computed using VolumetricSMPL\\u00a0[24].\\nThis loss penalizes scene points that lie inside the body volume and evaluates to zero when no interpenetration occurs.\\n\\n\\nTo further enforce task-consistent body-scene contact, we introduce a contact loss guided by the refined contact graph \\ud835\\udca2\\u2217\\\\mathcal{G}^{*}.\\nFor each contact pair (b,o)\\u2208\\ud835\\udca2\\u2217(b,o)\\\\in\\\\mathcal{G}^{*}, where bb denotes a body part and oo a corresponding scene element, we minimize the distance between the body vertices \\ud835\\udcb1b\\\\mathcal{V}_{b} and the scene points \\ud835\\udcaeo\\\\mathcal{S}_{o} using a single-sided Chamfer distance:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2112con=\\u2211(b,o)\\u2208\\ud835\\udca2\\u22171|\\ud835\\udcb1b|\\u200b\\u2211\\ud835\\udc2f\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb1bmin\\ud835\\udc2c\\u2208\\ud835\\udcaeo\\u2061\\u2016\\ud835\\udc2f\\u2212\\ud835\\udc2c\\u201622.\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{con}}=\\\\sum_{(b,o)\\\\in\\\\mathcal{G}^{*}}\\\\frac{1}{|\\\\mathcal{V}_{b}|}\\\\sum_{\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{V}_{b}}\\\\min_{\\\\mathbf{s}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{S}_{o}}\\\\|\\\\mathbf{v}-\\\\mathbf{s}\\\\|_{2}^{2}.\\n\\n(4)\\n\\n\\nThe single-sided formulation pulls the body toward the intended contact surfaces without over-constraining the scene geometry.\\nFor foot contacts, the loss is computed only on vertices near the toes and heel, allowing fine-grained poses such as tiptoe standing.\\nTo regularize the pose space during optimization, we incorporate a VPoser prior\\u00a0[27].\\nSpecifically, we define\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2112prior=\\u2016\\ud835\\udc33\\u201622,\\ud835\\udc33=VPoserEnc\\u200b(\\u03b8b),\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{prior}}=\\\\|\\\\,\\\\mathbf{z}\\\\,\\\\|_{2}^{2},\\\\qquad\\\\mathbf{z}=\\\\mathrm{VPoserEnc}(\\\\theta^{b}),\\n\\n(5)\\n\\n\\nwhere VPoserEnc\\u200b(\\u22c5)\\\\mathrm{VPoserEnc}(\\\\cdot) denotes the VPoser encoder and \\ud835\\udc33\\\\mathbf{z} is encouraged to follow a standard normal distribution.\\nThe overall optimization

as\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2112=\\u03bbcol\\u200b\\u2112col+\\u03bbcon\\u200b\\u2112con+\\u03bbprior\\u200b\\u2112prior,\\\\mathcal{L}=\\\\lambda_{\\\\text{col}}\\\\,\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{col}}+\\\\lambda_{\\\\text{con}}\\\\,\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{con}}+\\\\lambda_{\\\\text{prior}}\\\\,\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{prior}},\\n\\n(6)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u03bbcol\\\\lambda_{\\\\text{col}}, \\u03bbcon\\\\lambda_{\\\\text{con}}, and \\u03bbprior\\\\lambda_{\\\\text{prior}} are scalar weighting coefficients.\\n\\n\\n\\nTwo-stage optimization strategy.\\n\\nAs summarized in Algorithm\\u00a01, the refinement is carried out in two stages.\\nIn the first stage, we optimize the 3D translation rr, the global body orientation around the gravity axis \\u03c6g\\\\varphi_{g}, and the arm pose parameters \\u03b8arm\\\\theta^{\\\\text{arm}}.\\nJointly optimizing the arm articulation and global translation enables the hands to reach and establish contact with the target functional elements specified by the task.\\nTo preserve physical realism, the global orientation is restricted to rotations around the gravity axis, which prevents unnatural body tilting while still allowing feasible interaction configurations and obstacle avoidance.\\nThe second stage focuses on improving physical plausibility and contact stability.\\nIn this stage, we optimize the full body pose \\u03b8\\\\theta together with the 3D translation rr, with particular emphasis on the ankle joints to ensure stable foot-ground contact.\\nA smaller learning rate \\u03b72\\\\eta_{2} (set to 15\\u200b\\u03b71\\\\frac{1}{5}\\\\eta_{1}) is adopted to allow subtle pose adjustments without disrupting the refined configuration.\\nThe pose prior loss

synthesis, we construct a benchmark derived from the SceneFun3D dataset\\u00a0[4].\\nWe select 30 indoor scenes with diverse layouts (living rooms, bedrooms, kitchens, and bathrooms), each containing three views with RGB images, depth maps, and mask annotations for key affordance elements (e.g., door handles, couches, and floors).\\nFor each scene, we consider two evaluation settings: functional HSI and general HSI.\\nThe functional HSI prompts are taken from SceneFun3D and specify only the intended goal (e.g., open the door, adjust the temperature), requiring models to infer the relevant functional elements.\\nIn contrast, general HSI uses manually annotated prompts that explicitly describe both the action and the target object (e.g., sit on the chair, stand in front of the window).\\nThis results in a total of 60 curated interaction tasks.\\nIn addition, we capture real-world city scenes from multi-view images using GeoCalib\\u00a0[36] and MapAnything\\u00a0[15] to

The symbol * denotes that the baselines are their modified versions for fair comparison.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvaluation Metrics.\\n\\nWe evaluate HSI synthesis using 4 complementary metrics, i.e. semantic consistency score (SCS), non-collision score (NCS), non-functional contact distance (N-FCD), and functional contact distance (FCD), respectively.\\nThe semantic consistency score measures the alignment between the synthesized 3D interaction and the input text prompt.\\nWe compute a CLIP score\\u00a0[31] by rendering each synthesized interaction into three views, extracting image-text cosine similarities using CLIP ViT-B/32, and averaging the scores across views.\\nFor non-collision score, we compute a non-collision score based on penetration between the SMPL-X body mesh and the reconstructed scene point cloud, following VolumetricSMPL\\u00a0[24].\\nFor non-functional contact distance, we use the average Chamfer distance between the human body mesh and supporting scene elements (e.g., the floor or chair).\\nThe functional contact distance assesses whether the synthesized interaction has appropriate contact with task-relevant functional elements, e.g., a hand touching a door handle in the task of \\u201copen the door\\u201d.\\nThis metric is computed as the Chamfer distance between the functional element region and the interacting human hands.\\n\\n\\n\\nBaselines.\\n\\nTo our knowledge, no existing method explicitly targets functional human-scene interactions in 3D.\\nWe therefore compare our approach with the most closely related baselines.\\nGenZI\\u00a0[18] synthesizes human appearances in individual views and reconstructs a 3D body via multi-view fitting.\\nFor a fair comparison, we adapt GenZI to operate on the same three posed RGB-D images used in our benchmark.\\nGenHSI\\u00a0[20] proposes a training-free pipeline for generating long human-scene interaction videos by combining keyframe planning, 3D-aware inpainting, and motion animation.\\nWe extend GenHSI with functional element detection, perform human inpainting from randomly sampled views, and apply its original body-fitting strategy to our inputs.\\nDue to these adaptations, the resulting baselines are denoted as GenZI* and GenHSI*, respectively.\\n\\n\\nFigure 4: Qualitative results on SceneFun3D for general human-scene interaction.\\nWe compare GenZI*, GenHSI*, and our FunHSI with non-functional prompts such as sitting, squatting, and walking.\\n\\n\\nFigure 5: Qualitative results on SceneFun3D for functional human-scene interaction.\\nGiven open-vocabulary functional commands (e.g., adjusting temperature, dialing a number, switching a radio station) and posed RGB-D inputs, we compare GenZI*, GenHSI*, and our FunHSI.\\nExisting methods struggle to reason about task intent and often interact with incorrect objects or miss fine-grained functional components.\\nIn contrast, FunHSI accurately identifies task-relevant functional elements and generates physically plausible 3D human poses that establish correct contacts with both large objects and small functional parts (e.g., knobs, dials, cabinet handles), demonstrating robust functional grounding and contact reasoning.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.1 Comparison to Baselines\\n\\nQuantitative Evaluation.\\n\\nTable\\u00a01 summarizes the quantitative comparison between our FunHSI method and the modified baselines.\\nOverall, FunHSI performs competitively in the general HSI setting and substantially outperforms the baselines in functional HSI.\\nFor general HSI, FunHSI achieves comparable semantic consistency (0.2498) while improving physical plausibility.\\nIn particular, it attains the lowest contact distance (0.7481), outperforming GenZI* (0.8496) and GenHSI* (0.7599), together with a slightly higher non-collision score (0.9929), indicating that improved contact quality is not achieved at the cost of increased body-scene penetration.\\nFor functional HSI, FunHSI consistently yields the best results, with the lowest functional contact distance (0.2968) and the lowest overall contact distance (0.1837), significantly outperforming GenZI* and GenHSI*.\\nAlthough GenHSI* achieves a marginally higher non-collision score (0.9925 vs. 0.9917), FunHSI maintains comparable physical plausibility and semantic consistency (0.2540).\\n\\n\\nFigure 6: Illustration of

comparisons under both general and functional human-scene interaction scenarios.\\nFor functional tasks that require identifying and interacting with task-relevant elements (e.g., operating knobs, opening drawers, or interacting with small appliances), the baseline methods often fail to localize the correct functional targets or produce inaccurate hand-object contacts.\\nIn contrast, FunHSI consistently grounds interactions on the appropriate functional elements and generates realistic human-scene interactions.\\nFor general interaction prompts such as sitting, squatting, or standing near scene objects, FunHSI produces perceptually plausible body poses and interactions, achieving performance comparable to the baseline methods.\\nFig.\\u00a06 further illustrates the functional awareness of FunHSI: given different high-level task prompts abouth the same scene or object, the generated bodies accomplish the intended tasks with diverse and appropriate poses.\\nAdditional visual results are provided in the supplementary material.\\n\\n\\n\\nGeneralization to City Scenes.\\n\\nFig.\\u00a07 presents qualitative results on in-the-wild city scenes captured using a smartphone in public spaces in a city.\\nGiven multi-view RGB images reconstructed into 3D scenes, FunHSI successfully generates plausible human-scene interactions for diverse real-world tasks, such as opening an emergency door, buying a parking ticket, and sitting on a bench.\\nDespite the challenges posed by cluttered environments, noisy geometry, and incomplete reconstructions, our method robustly grounds interactions to the correct functional elements and produces physically plausible body poses.\\nThese results demonstrate that FunHSI generalizes beyond curated indoor datasets and is compatible with real-world feedforward 3D reconstruction pipelines.\\nMore visualizations are provided in Fig.\\u00a012 of the supplementary material.\\n\\n\\nFigure 8: User study of 3D human\\u2013scene interaction

Study\\n\\nWe conduct a perceptual user study to evaluate the visual quality and interaction realism of synthesized 3D human\\u2013scene interactions.\\nThe study is performed on the SceneFun3D benchmark under both functional HSI and general HSI settings.\\nParticipants are presented with rendered interaction results generated by FunHSI and the baseline methods, and are asked to select the most plausible and realistic human\\u2013scene interaction for each task.\\nThe evaluation focuses on overall perceptual quality, including the appropriateness of body pose, physical plausibility of contact, and consistency with the given task prompt.\\nFig.\\u00a08 summarizes the user preference results.\\nOverall, FunHSI is strongly preferred over the baseline methods across all evaluation settings.\\nWhen taking GenHSI as a representative baseline, FunHSI achieves an overall preference rate of 71.1%.\\nWhen evaluated separately, FunHSI obtains a preference rate of 76.8% for functional HSI and 66.0% for general HSI, indicating a clear advantage in scenarios that require functional reasoning and affordance-aware interaction.\\nMoreover, the preference margins are more pronounced in functional HSI, indicating that users are particularly sensitive to correct functional grounding and realistic contact with task-relevant elements.\\nThese results demonstrate that FunHSI not only improves quantitative metrics, but also produces perceptually more convincing human\\u2013scene interactions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMethod\\nNCS \\u2191\\\\uparrow\\nN-FCD \\u2193\\\\downarrow\\nFCD

(green).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3 Ablation Studies\\n\\nContact graph refinement.\\n\\nWe ablate the contact graph refinement module by directly using the initial contact graph predicted by the LLM, without aligning left-right relations to the inpainting image.\\nAs shown in Table\\u00a02 and Fig.\\u00a09, removing this refinement leads to degraded contact accuracy, particularly for supporting elements such as the floor, while only marginally affecting the functional distance.\\nThis behavior indicates that ambiguities in left-right correspondence between the contact graph and the generated image can cause failures in the body fitting stage, highlighting the importance of contact graph refinement for stable and accurate interactions.\\n\\n\\n\\nBody & hand pose estimation.\\n\\nWe evaluate the importance of body and hand pose estimation by removing this module from our pipeline and initializing the SMPL-X body with a T-pose prior to refinement.\\nAs shown in Table\\u00a02 and Fig.\\u00a010, this modification leads to consistent degradation across all metrics.\\nThis observation indicates that accurate body and hand pose estimation from the inpainted image plays a critical role in guiding the optimization.\\n\\n\\nFigure 10: Effect of body and hand pose initialization.\\nBody and hand pose initialization provides a consistent starting point, enabling correct hand placement and stable refinement for functional interactions.\\n\\n\\n\\nBody refinement.\\n\\nWe ablate the body refinement stage by directly using the estimated SMPL-X pose without further optimization.\\nAs shown in Table\\u00a02, this results in increased body-scene penetration and less realistic contacts, indicating that the initial pose alone is insufficient to resolve geometric inconsistencies.\\nThese results confirm the necessity of body refinement for producing physically plausible and functionally correct HSI.\\n\\n\\n\\nFunctional element detection.\\n\\nTo evaluate the impact of detection accuracy, we replace the predicted functional element masks with ground-truth annotations (i.e., oracle detection).\\nAs reported in Table\\u00a02, oracle detection leads to a noticeable reduction in functional contact distance (from 0.2968 to 0.2662) while preserving comparable non-collision performance.\\nThis improvement suggests that our generation framework can directly benefit from more robust upstream detection modules.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"5 Conclusion\": \"\\n\\n5 Conclusion\\n\\nIn this work, we studied the problem of functional human-scene interaction synthesis, where a human must reason about object functionality and establish appropriate physical contact to accomplish an open-vocabulary task in a novel 3D scene.\\nWe proposed FunHSI, a training-free and functionality-driven framework that generates 3D human-scene interactions from posed RGB-D observations and open-vocabulary task prompts, without relying on explicit action-object descriptions.\\nBy integrating functionality-aware contact graph reasoning, human initialization, and optimization-based body refinement, FunHSI bridges high-level task intent and physically plausible interaction.\\nExtensive evaluations on a benchmark derived from SceneFun3D show that FunHSI consistently outperforms existing baselines, particularly for functional interactions, while maintaining strong physical plausibility.\\nWe believe FunHSI represents a step toward more semantically grounded human-scene interaction synthesis and opens up future directions for long-horizon and real-world embodied interaction.\\n\\n\\nLimitations and future work.\\n\\nOur method currently focuses on single-step functional human-scene interactions, where a single human pose is synthesized to accomplish a given task.\\nAs a result, it does not explicitly model long-horizon or multi-step interactions that require sequential planning or temporal reasoning across multiple actions (e.g., opening a door and then walking through it).\\nExtending FunHSI to support temporally coherent, multi-step functional interactions remains an interesting direction for future work.\\nIn addition, the scales of city scenes are estimated from RGB images. Unifying the body and the scene scales is also a future work.\\n\\n\\n\", \"Acknowledgement\": \"\\nAcknowledgement\\n\\nWe sincerely thank Alexandros Delitzas and Francis Engelmann for the guidance on SceneFun3D, Priyanka Patel on the guidance of CameraHMR, Muhammed Kocabas for fruitful discussions on foundation models.\\nWe also sincerely thank Nitin Saini and Nathan Bajandas for kind help and explorations on Unreal Engine.

executable contact reasoning, we annotate the SMPL-X body surface using a hierarchical part decomposition.\\nAt the coarse level, we partition the body surface into 15 semantic parts following the SMPL-X template\\u00a0[27]:\\nhead, left upper arm, right upper arm, left forearm, right forearm,\\nleft hand, right hand, back, buttocks,\\nleft thigh, right thigh, left calf, right calf, left foot, and right foot,\\nas illustrated in Fig.\\u00a011.\\nEach part corresponds to a fixed subset of vertices on the SMPL-X mesh, yielding consistent semantic labeling across different poses and body shapes.\\nSince functional interactions in indoor environments are primarily performed by the hands and often involve small-scale objects (e.g., knobs, switches, dials), we further introduce a fine-grained hand annotation.\\nSpecifically, each hand is subdivided into six sub-parts: one palm and five fingers.\\nEach sub-part is associated with a predefined vertex set on the SMPL-X mesh, as shown in Fig.\\u00a011.\\nThis design allows the representation of both whole-hand contacts (e.g., palm-handle) and finger-level functional interactions (e.g., index finger-button) without introducing unnecessary anatomical complexity.\\nThis hierarchical annotation plays a dual role in our pipeline.\\nFirst, it provides a structured and semantically grounded vocabulary for LLM-based contact graph reasoning, enabling the model to express contacts using interpretable body-part names (e.g., \\u201cleft index finger touches the switch\\u201d).\\nSecond, it establishes a direct mapping from contact semantics to geometric constraints: each contact node bb in the contact graph is mapped to its corresponding vertex set \\ud835\\udcb1b\\\\mathcal{V}_{b}, which is used to compute contact losses during body refinement.\\nBy grounding language-level contact reasoning in mesh-level geometry, this annotation enables precise functional interactions while maintaining physical plausibility.\\n\\n\", \"Appendix B Datasets Details\": \"\\n\\nAppendix B Datasets Details\\n\\nIndoor scenes from SceneFun3D\\u00a0[4].\\n\\nTo systematically evaluate both prior methods and our approach for human-scene interaction (HSI) synthesis under fair and controlled settings, we construct a new benchmark derived from the SceneFun3D dataset.\\nWe select 30 indoor scenes covering diverse spatial layouts and functional contexts, including living rooms, bedrooms, kitchens, and bathrooms.\\nAll scenes contain common household objects that afford human interaction, such as doors, drawers, cabinets, switches, radiators, and supporting furniture.\\nFor each scene, we provide three canonical RGB-D views captured from different viewpoints, where each view consists of an RGB image, a depth image, and pixel-level mask annotations for key affordance-bearing elements (e.g., door handles, knobs, floors, and supporting surfaces).\\nUsing known camera parameters, the three views are back-projected and fused into a unified 3D point cloud, which serves as the geometric input for all interaction synthesis methods.\\nFor each scene, we manually define two types of interaction settings: functional human-scene interaction (functional HSI) and non-functional human-scene interaction (general HSI).\\nFunctional HSI requires the human to interact with a specific functional element to accomplish a task objective (e.g., open the door, adjust the room temperature, dial a number on the telephone), while non-functional HSI involves generic body-scene interactions that do not rely on object functionality (e.g., sit on the floor, stand in front of the window).\\nEach interaction setting is paired with a single text prompt per scene, resulting in a total of 60 curated interaction tasks (30 functional and 30 non-functional).\\nThe functional interaction prompts are designed to cover a diverse range of manipulation affordances, including pinch_pull, hook_pull, tip_push, rotate, plug_in, unplug, and key_press.\\nMost tasks involve fine-grained hand-object interactions, intentionally emphasizing functional reasoning and precise contact modeling rather than coarse body placement alone.\\nAll methods are evaluated on the same set of scenes, views, and text prompts without additional training or scene-specific tuning.\\nThe reconstructed scene geometry and affordance annotations are reused across different interaction prompts within each scene to ensure consistent and fair comparison.\\n\\n\\n\\nReal-world city scenes.\\n\\nTo evaluate the generalization ability of FunHSI under open-world conditions, we additionally collect a set of real-world city scenes captured in public environments.\\nAll data are captured using an iPhone 14 Pro Max. For each scene, we take multiple RGB images from different viewpoints. We use GeoCalib\\u00a0[36] to estimate the camera intrinsic parameters and the gravity direction, and use MapAnything\\u00a0[15] to estimate the camera poses, the depth maps, and the 3D scene point cloud.\\n\\n\\nThe collected scenes include diverse outdoor and semi-outdoor environments such as building entrances, staircases, ticket machines, escalators, benches, and public facilities, featuring challenging factors including clutter, reflective surfaces, varying illumination, and unconstrained object layouts.\\nWe apply the same processing pipeline as in indoor scenes without any scene-specific tuning.\\nThis experimental setting allows us to assess whether FunHSI can generalize beyond curated indoor datasets and reliably synthesize function-aware human-scene interactions in real-world, unconstrained environments.\\n\\n\\n\", \"Appendix C Implementation Details\": \"\\n\\nAppendix C Implementation Details\\n\\nAll our experiments are conducted on a single NVIDIA A6000

graph generation.\\nAll vision-language model queries are performed in a zero-shot manner, without task-specific fine-tuning.\\nScene reconstruction is performed by back-projecting three posed RGB-D views into a unified point cloud using known camera parameters.\\nFunctional and supporting elements are segmented using SAM-ViT-H and lifted into 3D.\\nThe reconstructed scene geometry and functional element annotations are cached and reused across different interaction prompts within the same scene.\\nHuman body initialization is obtained via image-space human inpainting using Gemini.\\nTo reduce hallucinations, we apply a generator-evaluator loop with at most four iterations.\\nInitial 3D human parameters are estimated using CameraHMR\\u00a0[26] for body pose and WiLoR\\u00a0[30] for hand

\"Appendix D More Experimental Analysis\": \"\\n\\nAppendix D More Experimental Analysis\\n\\nAdditional results on real-world cenes.\\n\\nFig.\\u00a012 presents additional qualitative results of our FunHSI on real-world scenes captured in public environments.\\nThese scenes exhibit significantly higher visual and geometric complexity than indoor datasets, including cluttered backgrounds, irregular lighting conditions, reflective surfaces, and diverse object appearances.\\nGiven three posed RGB-D views and a task-level text prompt, FunHSI successfully synthesizes functionally appropriate human-scene interactions without scene-specific tuning.\\nAs shown in the figure, our method correctly identifies task-relevant functional elements and generates plausible interactions for a wide range of actions, such as taking escalators or elevators, buying tickets from vending machines, opening doors, pinning objects to a whiteboard, and interacting with urban furniture.\\nThese results demonstrate that FunHSI generalizes beyond curated indoor datasets and is capable of handling open-world scenes while preserving functional grounding, contact correctness, and physical plausibility.\\n\\n\\n\\nGeneration Diversity.\\n\\nFig.\\u00a013 illustrates the diversity of human-scene interactions generated by FunHSI under the same scene and task prompt.\\nFor each example, we visualize multiple valid 3D human poses that differ in body configuration, viewpoint, and spatial arrangement, while consistently preserving the intended functional contact.\\nSpecifically, FunHSI produces diverse interaction realizations for tasks such as opening a drawer, dialing a telephone, and opening a door, all of which maintain correct contact with the task-relevant functional elements.\\nThese variations arise from differences in initial image synthesis and subsequent geometric refinement, rather than changes in task specification.\\nThis result demonstrates that FunHSI does not collapse to a single canonical pose, but instead supports diverse yet functionally consistent human-scene interaction generation.\\n\\n\\n\\nHuman Inpainting Examples.\\n\\nFig.\\u00a03 presents representative examples of task-conditioned human inpainting in our pipeline.\\nGiven an input RGB image and a task-level functional prompt, the inpainting model synthesizes a human that is spatially consistent with the scene layout and roughly aligned with the intended interaction region.\\nImportantly, the inpainted humans already reflect coarse functional intent (e.g., reaching, crouching, or bending), providing a semantically meaningful and visually grounded initialization that reduces ambiguity in subsequent 3D reconstruction.\\n\\n\\n\\nBody and Hand Pose Estimation Examples.\\n\\nBased on the inpainted images in Fig.\\u00a03, we estimate the initial 3D SMPL-X body pose together with articulated hand poses.\\nThe estimated poses capture coarse body configuration and hand-object alignment in image space, including which hand is used and its approximate contact location.\\nThese estimates serve as strong initialization for our geometry-aware body refinement, significantly improving optimization stability, accelerating convergence, and reducing failure cases such as incorrect hand assignment or implausible body configurations.\\n\\n\\nFigure 15: \\nLayout

We discard all submissions where even a single one of the three catch trials is failed: 25 out of a total of 120 completions.

Recent systems  (lu2024aiscientist; yamada2025aiscientistv2; gottweis_towards_2025) demonstrate that LLM-based agents can autonomously execute an end-to-end research loop, including literature review, code generation, experiment execution, and manuscript drafting. These results suggest that automated scientific discovery is becoming practically feasible and that LLM-based agents are approaching a level of functional completeness required for autonomous research (jin_agentreview_2024; sahu_reviewertoo_2025; ajith2024litsearch; zhang_noveltybench_2025; zhang2026opennovelty).\\n\\n\\nDespite this progress, existing systems remain constrained by a fundamental inefficiency in their execution paradigm, which limits their scalability and robustness in practice. In particular, most current research agents (wang_openhands_2025; yang_swe-agent_2024; mitchener_kosmos_2025; luo2025llm4sr) rely on an on-the-spot computation strategy, where nearly all information acquisition, reasoning, and synthesis are performed online at runtime. Under this paradigm, each new research attempt requires the agent to dynamically retrieve large volumes of scientific literature, read and summarize long and heterogeneous documents in real time, and explore a broad space of candidate methods and experimental designs through open-ended generation and trial-and-error. As a result, the cost of producing a single effective scientific discovery remains substantial. For example, a complete execution of the overall pipeline often requires several hours and, in some cases, up to 15 hours to progress from ideation to experimentation (lu2024aiscientist). Similarly, in (schmidgall_agent_2025), literature review and experimental planning alone account for a significant portion of total inference time and place heavy demands on the language model\\u2019s ability to maintain coherent reasoning over long contexts. More importantly, this runtime-centric design repeatedly forces the model to re-process large volumes of unstructured and partially redundant information, even when much of the underlying scientific knowledge is already well established, thereby increasing computational overhead and exacerbating the risk of hallucination and reasoning errors (wang2025repomaster; shin_mind_2025).\\n\\n\\nTo address the efficiency and reliability limitations of existing autonomous research agents, we propose Idea2Story, a scientific discovery framework that explicitly separates offline knowledge construction from online research generation, with the goal of reducing repeated reasoning over scientific literature and alleviating the context window bottleneck of large language models. Most current systems rely on runtime-centric execution, where agents repeatedly retrieve, read, summarize, and reason over large collections of highly overlapping papers for each new research attempt, resulting in substantial computational cost and prolonged execution time. Idea2Story mitigates this inefficiency by shifting literature understanding from online reasoning to an offline stage. In the offline phase, the system periodically collects recently accepted, peer-reviewed papers together with their full review feedback, extracts core methodological units and research patterns, and organizes these units and their observed composition relations into a continuously updated structured knowledge graph. This knowledge graph serves as a compact and reusable representation of established scientific methods and their empirical compatibility, replacing repeated processing of raw documents at runtime. Building on this offline knowledge infrastructure, Idea2Story performs online research generation by aligning underspecified user research intents with existing research paradigms encoded in the knowledge graph. Rather than relying on open-ended generation and trial-and-error, the system retrieves high-quality research patterns as structured compositions of method units, which act as stable methodological blueprints for downstream experimental design and execution. Guided by these validated research patterns, Idea2Story conducts feasibility-driven experimentation and ultimately generates a complete, submission-ready paper in an end-to-end manner.\\n\\n\\nFigure 1:  Overview of the two-stage framework in Idea2Story. The offline stage constructs a structured knowledge graph by extracting and organizing reusable method units from a curated paper corpus. The online stage retrieves and composes research patterns from the knowledge graph to ground underspecified user intent into concrete and coherent research directions.\\n\\n\\nOur work makes the following contributions to autonomous scientific discovery :\\n(1) We introduce Idea2Story, a framework that formalizes autonomous research as a\\npre-computation\\u2013driven process, where scientific knowledge is extracted, structured, and\\nmaintained in a continuously updated methodological knowledge graph, addressing the inefficiency and\\nunreliability of runtime-centric research agents. (2) We propose a knowledge-grounded planning and execution pipeline that alleviates the context window bottleneck and reduces repeated runtime reasoning over literature by converting paper reading into retrieval over a pre-built knowledge graph. (3) We conduct preliminary empirical studies and comparative evaluations, demonstrating that Idea2Story can produce several high-quality research demos and establishing the practical feasibility of the proposed paradigm in an end-to-end setting.\\n\\n\", \"2 Related Work\": \"\\n\\n2 Related Work\\n\\n\\n2.1 Autonomous Scientific Discovery\\n\\nRecent advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven growing interest in autonomous scientific\\ndiscovery agents that aim to automate the full research lifecycle, from code generation to experimental\\nexecution  (hu_controlled_2026; zhang2025evolving; lin_se-agent_2025). Early systems such as The AI Scientist (v1) (lu2024aiscientist) demonstrate the\\nviability of end-to-end automation but rely heavily on manually crafted code templates and largely\\nlinear exploration workflows, which restrict discovery depth and adaptability. Later approaches, including\\nThe AI Scientist-v2 (yamada2025aiscientistv2) and Kosmos (mitchener_kosmos_2025), reduce reliance on\\nexplicit template through the incorporation of agentic tree search and experiment management agents, enabling iterative and multi-round exploration.\\n\\n\\nIn research ideation, LLM-generated ideas are often perceived as highly novel during initial screening; however, prior studies (si2024can) uncover a critical paradox whereby such ideas tend to underperform after implementation relative to human-generated ideas, indicating limited feasibility and practical\\nutility. As more ideas are generated, LLM outputs exhibit growing similarity, leading to diminished meaningful diversity. Similar limitations have also been observed in research evaluation and peer\\nreview (liang2024can; xu2025can; thakkar_can_2025; zhang2026opennovelty). Existing AI-based reviewers display systematic blind\\nspots: shin_mind_2025 shows that LLM reviewers place disproportionate\\nemphasis on technical correctness while undervaluing novelty, deviating from human\\nexpert judgment, while sahu_reviewertoo_2025 demonstrates that AI reviewers\\nstruggle to distinguish fine-grained acceptance categories and are susceptible to sycophancy, with\\nreview scores increasing unreasonably after exposure to author rebuttals. Although recent approaches\\nsuch as AgentReview (jin_agentreview_2024) seek to mitigate these deficiencies by simulating\\ndiverse reviewer roles, automated evaluation systems remain less reliable than human experts in\\nidentifying robust accept/reject decision boundaries.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2.2 LLM-Driven Agents\\n\\nLLM-driven agents still struggle to interact effectively with complex real-world environments.\\nDespite their strong generative capabilities, many existing systems\\u2014such as OpenHands (wang_openhands_2025)\\nand SWE-Agent (yang_swe-agent_2024)\\u2014exhibit limited performance when applied to realistic\\ncodebases. These limitations largely stem from insufficient reasoning over hierarchical dependencies\\nand structural constraints, as well as the inherent restrictions imposed by finite context windows.\\nAs a result, LLM-driven agents achieve relatively low task completion rates on challenging benchmarks\\nsuch as MLE-bench (chan_mlebench_2024) and SciCode (tian_scicode_2024).\\nRepoMaster (wang2025repomaster) further identifies inadequate modeling of codebase structure,\\nincluding function call graphs and module dependency graphs, as a key bottleneck for LLM-driven agents\\noperating in large and complex environments.\\n\\n\\nBeyond execution limitations, LLM-driven agents also exhibit notable deficiencies in scientific rigor\\nand evaluative judgment. When tasked with autonomous assessment, these agents are prone to hallucination and overconfidence. For instance, Agent Laboratory (schmidgall_agent_2025) reports that automated evaluations produced by LLM-driven agents substantially overestimate paper quality compared to human reviewers. Evaluations of Kosmos (mitchener_kosmos_2025) further reveal a tendency to invent opaque quantitative metrics and to conflate statistical significance with scientific value, leading to weak interpretability of experimental conclusions. Moreover, long-horizon autonomous execution exacerbates these issues by introducing behavioral\\ndrift (arike2025tech), where LLM-driven agents gradually deviate from intended research trajectories or generate overly strong and insufficiently justified claims (lu2024aiscientist; schmidgall2025agent; baek_researchagent_2025; hong_metagpt_2023; wu_autogen_2023; lin_se-agent_2025; hu_controlled_2026). This drift further undermines reliability and highlights the\\nneed for stronger structural grounding and validation mechanisms in LLM-based autonomous research\\nsystems.\\n\\n\\n\", \"3 General Idea Generation\": \"\\n\\n3 General Idea Generation\\n\\nIdea2Story is designed to interact with users through high-level and often informal research ideas\\nthat reflect human intuition rather than fully specified technical plans. The system transforms\\nsuch underspecified inputs into structured and academically grounded research directions through\\na two-stage paradigm that separates offline knowledge construction from online research generation:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nOffline Knowledge Construction.\\nIn the offline stage, Idea2Story builds a reusable methodological foundation from existing\\nscientific literature. This includes curating a large-scale paper pool from peer-reviewed\\nvenues, extracting reusable method units that capture core methodological contributions, and\\norganizing these units into a structured knowledge graph that encodes their semantic and\\ncompositional relations. The resulting knowledge graph serves as a persistent repository of\\nmethodological abstractions, decoupling literature understanding from runtime reasoning.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nOnline Research Generation.\\nIn the online stage, Idea2Story grounds user-provided research ideas through retrieval and\\ncomposition over the pre-built knowledge graph. Given an informal user idea, the system aligns\\nthe input with existing research paradigms, retrieves relevant research patterns, and composes\\ncompatible method units into concrete research directions. These instantiated patterns are\\nfurther refined through a review-guided process that iteratively evaluates and revises them with\\nrespect to novelty, methodological soundness, and conceptual coherence. The refined research\\npatterns then serve as structured blueprints for subsequent planning, feasibility-driven\\nexperimentation, and end-to-end paper generation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1 Offline Knowledge Construction\\n\\nThe offline knowledge construction stage aims to distill reusable methodological structure from\\nexisting scientific literature and to organize it in a form that can be efficiently accessed during\\nonline research generation. Instead of performing document-level reasoning at runtime, Idea2Story\\npre-computes a structured representation of prior work that captures both methodological\\nabstractions and their observed compatibility in accepted research. This stage consists of three\\nmain components: (i) constructing a curated paper pool from peer-reviewed venues, (ii) extracting\\ncore method units that represent reusable methodological contributions, and (iii) organizing these\\nunits and their composition relations into a structured knowledge graph. Together, these components\\nform a persistent methodological memory that decouples literature understanding from downstream\\nidea grounding and research generation.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1.1 Paper Pool Construction\\n\\nWe construct a paper pool from accepted machine learning papers and their associated peer reviews\\ncollected from top-tier conferences.

Formally, we model method unit extraction as a mapping\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2130:p~\\u2192\\ud835\\udcb0p={up(1),\\u2026,up(Kp)},\\\\mathcal{E}:\\\\tilde{p}\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathcal{U}_{p}=\\\\{u_{p}^{(1)},\\\\dots,u_{p}^{(K_{p})}\\\\},\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere p~\\u2208\\ud835\\udcab~\\\\tilde{p}\\\\in\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}} denotes a single paper and \\ud835\\udcb0p\\\\mathcal{U}_{p} is a small set\\nof method units that capture its essential technical ideas.\\n\\n\\nAs illustrated in Figure 2, the extraction procedure leverages the standardized structure of\\nacademic papers and analyzes different sections to collect complementary methodological signals.\\nLet \\ud835\\udc31p=(introp,methodp,expp)\\\\mathbf{x}_{p}=(\\\\text{intro}_{p},\\\\text{method}_{p},\\\\text{exp}_{p}) denote the partition of a paper\\ninto its introduction, method, and experiments sections. The introduction is used to identify the\\nhigh-level research motivation and the precise problem formulation, the method section provides\\nsignals about core technical mechanisms such as modeling assumptions, learning objectives, model\\narchitectures, and optimization strategies, and the experiments section reflects how these\\nmechanisms are instantiated and evaluated in practice. By jointly aggregating information from\\nthese sections, the extractor isolates method units that correspond to the primary algorithmic or\\nmodeling contributions of the paper, rather than surface-level experimental details.\\n\\n\\nWe define a method unit u\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb0pu\\\\in\\\\mathcal{U}_{p} as a self-contained description of how a research\\nproblem is formulated or solved, abstracted away from specific implementation choices and\\nexperimental configurations. Elements that primarily involve dataset selection, hyperparameter\\ntuning, or engineering-level optimizations are excluded unless they induce substantive changes to\\nthe problem formulation, model structure, or learning objective. In practice, most papers yield one\\nor a small number of method units. Each extracted unit is further normalized into structured\\nmethodological attributes, including atomic meta-methods, which correspond to indivisible\\nmethodological elements, and composition-level patterns, which describe how multiple method\\nunits are combined within a single paper.\\n\\n\\nAfter extracting method units for all papers, we represent each paper p\\u2208\\ud835\\udcab~p\\\\in\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}}\\nby a vector embedding derived from its associated method units. Formally, let\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc33p=g\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb0p),\\\\mathbf{z}_{p}=g(\\\\mathcal{U}_{p}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udcb0p\\\\mathcal{U}_{p} denotes the set of extracted method units for paper pp and\\ng\\u200b(\\u22c5)g(\\\\cdot) is an embedding function that maps a set of method units to a fixed-dimensional\\nrepresentation.\\n\\n\\nTo induce higher-level research patterns, we first apply a nonlinear dimensionality reduction\\noperator\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc32p=UMAP\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc33p),\\\\mathbf{y}_{p}=\\\\mathrm{UMAP}(\\\\mathbf{z}_{p}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhich projects the high-dimensional embeddings into a lower-dimensional space while preserving\\nlocal semantic neighborhoods. We then perform density-based clustering on the reduced\\nrepresentations using DBSCAN, yielding a partition\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9e={C1,\\u2026,CM},\\\\mathcal{C}=\\\\{C_{1},\\\\dots,C_{M}\\\\},\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere each cluster Cm\\u2282\\ud835\\udcab~C_{m}\\\\subset\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}} corresponds to a coherent research pattern.\\n\\n\\nThese induced clusters serve as higher-level abstractions over individual papers, capturing\\nrecurring methodological structures that are reused across the literature. The resulting research\\npatterns form the basis for subsequent retrieval and composition.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2:  Offline knowledge graph construction in Idea2Story. Academic papers and their associated review artifacts are first anonymized and safety-filtered, then deconstructed into layered methodological representations. These layers capture complementary aspects of a paper, including its core research idea, domain context, high-level story skeleton, and packaging actions. The extracted elements are normalized into atomic method units and meta-methods, which are connected through composition and similarity relations. Reviewer feedback is incorporated as additional signals to refine relations and validate abstractions. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1.3 Knowledge Graph Construction\\n\\nBuilding on the extracted method units, we organize reusable methodological components into a\\nstructured knowledge graph that supports systematic method discovery and composition. While\\nindividual method units capture isolated algorithmic or modeling ideas, effective research methods\\nin practice typically arise from structured combinations of multiple method units. The knowledge\\ngraph provides a unified representation that explicitly encodes canonicalized method units,\\nmeta-methods, and their empirically observed composition relations in prior work.\\n\\n\\nFormally, we define the knowledge graph as a directed graph\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udca2=(\\ud835\\udcb1,\\u2130),\\\\mathcal{G}=(\\\\mathcal{V},\\\\mathcal{E}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere each node v\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb1v\\\\in\\\\mathcal{V} corresponds to a canonicalized method unit or a meta-method.\\nCanonicalization groups semantically similar method units across the corpus into shared\\nmeta-method abstractions, reducing surface-level variation while preserving core methodological\\nintent. As a result, nodes in the graph represent atomic or minimally indivisible methodological\\nelements that are reused across papers.\\n\\n\\nEdges in the graph encode composition relations between method units. For a given paper\\np\\u2208\\ud835\\udcab~p\\\\in\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}} with extracted method unit set \\ud835\\udcb0p\\\\mathcal{U}_{p}, we add directed edges\\nbetween pairs of method units (ui,uj)\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb0p\\u00d7\\ud835\\udcb0p(u_{i},u_{j})\\\\in\\\\mathcal{U}_{p}\\\\times\\\\mathcal{U}_{p} to indicate that\\nthey are jointly instantiated as part of the same methodological pipeline. These edges capture\\nempirical evidence of method compatibility observed in prior work, reflecting how different\\nmethod units are combined in practice rather than hypothetical or manually specified relations.\\n\\n\\nAggregating composition relations across the full corpus yields a graph structure that encodes both\\nmethodological abstraction and empirical compatibility. In particular, the graph captures two\\ncomplementary levels of structure: (i) reusable methodological elements represented as\\ncanonicalized method units and meta-methods, and (ii) composition constraints induced from\\nco-occurrence statistics in accepted papers. This separation allows Idea2Story to reason about\\nmethods at a higher level of abstraction than individual papers, while remaining grounded in\\nobserved research practice.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2 Online Research Generation.\\n\\nGiven a target research objective, Idea2Story treats method discovery as a graph-based retrieval and\\ncomposition problem over \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G}. The system retrieves relevant subgraphs and composes\\ncompatible method units by following connectivity constraints in the graph, producing candidate\\nresearch patterns that correspond to structured combinations of method units. These research\\npatterns serve as high-level methodological blueprints that bridge abstract research intent and\\nconcrete experimental design, enabling downstream planning, feasibility analysis, and end-to-end\\npaper generation.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2.1 Research Pattern Retrieval\\n\\nGiven a user-provided research idea expressed in natural language, we formulate research pattern\\nidentification as a structured retrieval problem over the knowledge graph \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G}. Let\\nqq denote the input research idea, and let \\ud835\\udc9e={C1,\\u2026,CM}\\\\mathcal{C}=\\\\{C_{1},\\\\dots,C_{M}\\\\} denote the set of\\nresearch patterns induced from the paper corpus. The goal is to rank patterns in \\ud835\\udc9e\\\\mathcal{C}\\naccording to their relevance to qq.\\n\\n\\nRather than relying on a single similarity metric, Idea2Story adopts a multi-view retrieval\\nformulation that aggregates complementary signals from different semantic abstractions. Formally,\\nfor each research pattern CmC_{m}, we compute a relevance score\\n\\n\\n\\ns\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)=\\u2211v\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb1\\u03bbv\\u200bsv\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q),s(C_{m}\\\\mid q)=\\\\sum_{v\\\\in\\\\mathcal{V}}\\\\lambda_{v}\\\\,s_{v}(C_{m}\\\\mid q),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udcb1={idea,domain,paper}\\\\mathcal{V}=\\\\{\\\\text{idea},\\\\text{domain},\\\\text{paper}\\\\} indexes the retrieval views,\\nsv\\u200b(\\u22c5)s_{v}(\\\\cdot) denotes a view-specific scoring function, and \\u03bbv\\\\lambda_{v} are fixed weighting\\ncoefficients that balance the contribution of different views.\\n\\n\\nIdea-level retrieval.\\n\\nAt the idea level, the system retrieves previously observed research ideas that are semantically\\nsimilar to the input query qq. Let \\u2110\\\\mathcal{I} denote the set of stored research ideas extracted\\nfrom the corpus, and let simidea\\u200b(q,i)\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{idea}}(q,i) denote a semantic similarity function\\nbetween qq and an idea i\\u2208\\u2110i\\\\in\\\\mathcal{I}. The idea-level score of a research pattern CmC_{m} is\\ncomputed by aggregating the similarity scores of ideas associated with the pattern:\\n\\n\\n\\nsidea\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)=maxi\\u2208\\u2110\\u200b(Cm)\\u2061simidea\\u200b(q,i),s_{\\\\text{idea}}(C_{m}\\\\mid q)=\\\\max_{i\\\\in\\\\mathcal{I}(C_{m})}\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{idea}}(q,i),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u2110\\u200b(Cm)\\\\mathcal{I}(C_{m}) denotes the set of ideas linked to pattern CmC_{m}.\\n\\n\\n\\nDomain-level retrieval.\\n\\nAt the domain level, the system interprets the input idea qq in terms of its underlying research\\ndomains and methodological themes. Let \\ud835\\udc9f\\\\mathcal{D} denote the set of research domains, and let\\nsimdomain\\u200b(q,d)\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{domain}}(q,d) measure the relevance between qq and domain d\\u2208\\ud835\\udc9fd\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}.\\nThe domain-level score of pattern CmC_{m} is computed as\\n\\n\\n\\nsdomain\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)=\\u2211d\\u2208\\ud835\\udc9f\\u200b(Cm)simdomain\\u200b(q,d)\\u200bw\\u200b(d,Cm),s_{\\\\text{domain}}(C_{m}\\\\mid q)=\\\\sum_{d\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}(C_{m})}\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{domain}}(q,d)\\\\,w(d,C_{m}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udc9f\\u200b(Cm)\\\\mathcal{D}(C_{m}) denotes the domains associated with pattern CmC_{m}, and w\\u200b(d,Cm)w(d,C_{m}) captures\\nempirical effectiveness signals derived from the knowledge graph.\\n\\n\\n\\nPaper-level retrieval.\\n\\nAt the paper level, the system retrieves papers whose technical content is semantically aligned\\nwith the input idea. Let \\ud835\\udcab\\u200b(Cm)\\\\mathcal{P}(C_{m}) denote the set of papers instantiating pattern CmC_{m}.\\nThe paper-level score is computed as\\n\\n\\n\\nspaper\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)=maxp\\u2208\\ud835\\udcab\\u200b(Cm)\\u2061simpaper\\u200b(q,p)\\u22c5\\u03b1\\u200b(p),s_{\\\\text{paper}}(C_{m}\\\\mid q)=\\\\max_{p\\\\in\\\\mathcal{P}(C_{m})}\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{paper}}(q,p)\\\\cdot\\\\alpha(p),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere simpaper\\u200b(q,p)\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{paper}}(q,p) measures semantic similarity between qq and paper pp,\\nand \\u03b1\\u200b(p)\\\\alpha(p) denotes a quality-related weight derived from peer review metadata.\\n\\n\\nThe final ranked list of research patterns is obtained by ordering patterns according to their\\naggregated multi-view relevance scores. Formally, we define\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9e\\u2217\\u200b(q)=RankCm\\u2208\\ud835\\udc9e\\u2061(\\u2211v\\u2208{idea,domain,paper}\\u03bbv\\u200bsv\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)),\\\\mathcal{C}^{*}(q)=\\\\operatorname{Rank}_{C_{m}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{C}}\\\\left(\\\\sum_{v\\\\in\\\\{\\\\text{idea},\\\\text{domain},\\\\text{paper}\\\\}}\\\\lambda_{v}\\\\,s_{v}(C_{m}\\\\mid q)\\\\right),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere patterns are sorted in descending order of the aggregated score.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2.2 Review-Guided Refinement\\n\\nAfter candidate research patterns are retrieved, Idea2Story refines them using an explicit\\nLLM-based review loop. In each iteration, a large language model is prompted to act as a reviewer\\nand evaluate the current research pattern along several predefined criteria, including technical\\nsoundness, novelty with respect to existing literature, and overall clarity of the problem\\u2013method\\nalignment. The reviewer produces both scalar judgments and concrete revision suggestions.\\n\\n\\nThe system then uses this feedback to update the research pattern in a targeted manner. When the\\nreview indicates insufficient novelty, the system modifies the pattern by recombining compatible\\nmethod units or introducing alternative realizations within the same pattern family. When the\\nreview identifies issues in feasibility or ambiguity in formulation, the system revises the problem\\ndefinition or method structure to improve consistency and executability. Each revised pattern is\\nre-submitted to the same review process, forming an explicit generate\\u2013review\\u2013revise loop.\\n\\n\\nTo prevent uncontrolled drift, only revisions that improve the reviewer scores are retained;\\notherwise, the system rolls back to the previous version. This process repeats until the reviewer\\njudges the pattern to be sufficiently novel, coherent, and technically plausible, or until further\\niterations no longer yield improvement. The output of this stage is a refined research pattern that\\nhas been iteratively vetted by an LLM-based reviewer and is suitable for downstream validation and\\npaper generation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"4 Experiments and Analysis\": \"\\n\\n4 Experiments and Analysis\\n\\nWe evaluate Idea2Story through a set of experiments focusing on its ability to extract reusable\\nmethodological structure and to generate high-quality research patterns from ambiguous user input.\\nOur experiments are conducted on a corpus of accepted papers from ICLR and NeurIPS over the past\\nthree years, including approximately 13K papers and their associated peer reviews, which serves as\\nthe foundation for all subsequent analyses. Based on this corpus, we first analyze the properties of the extracted method units to assess whether Idea2Story captures meaningful and reusable methodological abstractions. We then present qualitative demonstrations of research patterns instantiated as structured research stories, illustrating how the system transforms vague research intent into coherent and methodologically grounded research directions.\\n\\n\\n\\nCase 1: Method Unit Extraction Demo\\n\\n\\nPaper Title:\\nLearning Dynamics of LLM Finetuning\\nBase Problem:\\nUnderstanding how specific training examples influence model predictions during finetuning is challenging, particularly in large language models.\\nSolution Pattern:\\nDevelop a framework to analyze step-wise influence accumulation among potential responses during finetuning, providing insights into phenomena like hallucination and the squeezing effect in off-policy direct preference optimization.\\nStory:\\nReframe the understanding of LLM finetuning through the lens of learning dynamics, offering a unified interpretation of training behaviors and inspiring methods to enhance model alignment and performance.\\nApplication:\\nImproving alignment in large language models, enhancing finetuning strategies for better model performance, diagnosing and mitigating hallucination in AI systems.\\n\\nFigure 3: An example of a method unit extracted from an accepted paper, illustrating the separation of the base problem, solution pattern, and higher-level research story.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.1 Implementation Details\\n\\nTo further assess the effectiveness of Idea2Story in practical research ideation settings, we\\nconduct additional qualitative experiments on a small set of representative cases. Specifically,\\nwe evaluate three user-provided research ideas curated by an external collaborator. For each case,\\nIdea2Story generates research patterns using the GLM-4.7 (zeng2025glm) model as the underlying language backbone. As a baseline, we compare against direct LLM generation, where the same model is prompted to produce a complete research story without explicit pattern modeling or retrieval.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.2 Case Study: Method Unit Extraction\\n\\nWe present a representative case study to illustrate the behavior of the proposed method unit\\nextraction agent. Case 1 shows an example extracted from an accepted paper, where the system decomposes the full paper into a structured set of methodological elements.\\n\\n\\nAs shown in the example, the extracted method unit explicitly separates the underlying research\\nproblem, the core solution pattern, and the resulting research story. The Base Problem describes the core challenge addressed by the paper, namely understanding how individual training examples influence model behavior during finetuning, without depending on specific datasets or implementation details. The Solution Pattern summarizes the central methodological idea as\\nan analysis framework for step-wise influence accumulation, highlighting the key mechanism without\\nbinding it to a particular optimization setup or experimental configuration. Importantly, the extracted Story reframes the technical contribution at a higher level of\\nabstraction, connecting learning dynamics to broader phenomena such as hallucination and alignment\\nin large language models. This abstraction reflects how the method unit goes beyond algorithmic\\ndetails to capture the conceptual contribution of the paper. Finally, the Application\\nfield grounds the method unit by indicating downstream research and system-level implications,\\nwithout enumerating task-specific benchmarks.\\n\\n\\nThis example demonstrates that the extraction agent isolates reusable methodological structure while\\nfiltering out implementation-level details. By representing the paper as a coherent method unit\\nrather than a collection of experimental components, Idea2Story enables subsequent reuse,\\ncomparison, and composition of methodological ideas across papers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3 Knowledge Graph Analysis\\n\\nWe analyze the structure of the constructed knowledge graph to understand how extracted method\\nunits are distributed across papers and research domains. As illustrated in Figure 2, the graph\\nexhibits a clear hub-and-spoke structure, where a small number of high-frequency domains connect\\nto a large number of papers and research patterns. This reflects the uneven distribution of\\nresearch activity across domains, while also highlighting domains that function as central hubs\\nfor methodological reuse. Importantly, many research patterns are observed to connect multiple\\ndomains simultaneously, indicating that the extracted method units often capture methodological\\nabstractions that generalize beyond a single application area. In contrast, paper-level nodes are typically associated with a single domain, whereas pattern-level nodes frequently act as bridges between otherwise weakly connected domains. This structural separation suggests that the knowledge graph encodes two distinct levels of organization\\u2014instance-level\\n\\nFigure 4: Visualization of the knowledge graph substructure induced by high-frequency research\\ndomains.\\n\\n\\nresearch artifacts and reusable methodological abstractions\\u2014enabling Idea2Story to retrieve and compose research patterns at a higher level of abstraction rather than relying on domain-specific or paper-specific similarity alone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAspect\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIdea2Story Generated (IntentDiff)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLLM Direct Generated (EcoIntent)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTitle\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIntentDiff: Reframing E-commerce Intent Classification via Structural Evolution and Context-Aware Diffusion\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEcoIntent: A Context-Aware Multi-Granularity Agent for E-commerce Intent Understanding via Hierarchical Contrastive Learning\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbstract Focus\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReinterprets intent classification as a structural evolution process rather than static text classification. The approach leverages a diffusion-based framework to iteratively refine noisy query representations into precise intent labels, integrates product graph embeddings to ground predictions in e-commerce context, and introduces a discrete, context-aware tokenizer to handle long-tail domain vocabulary.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTargets improved intent classification performance by integrating heterogeneous behavioral context and hierarchical product knowledge.

User queries are short, ambiguous, and heavily dependent on implicit catalog structure, which fixed-label classification fails to capture. Intent understanding is modeled as an evolving process under structural constraints.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFormulates intent understanding as a conventional multi-class classification problem, where the input is a query augmented with session context and the output is an intent label from a predefined set. The main challenge is semantic sparsity caused by short and ambiguous queries.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCore Research Gap\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExisting intent classification methods treat queries in isolation and ignore domain-specific structural priors in e-commerce. They fail to exploit rich relationships between products and attributes, and standard vocabularies struggle with long-tail, domain-specific terminology. No prior work unifies diffusion-based refinement with structural graph embeddings for intent disambiguation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrior work suffers from (1) context isolation, where behavioral signals such as clicks are underutilized, and (2) a flat-label assumption that ignores the hierarchical nature of e-commerce taxonomies, leading to inconsistent predictions for fine-grained, long-tail intents.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMethod Skeleton\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA diffusion-based classifier that iteratively denoises intent representations; a context-aware discrete tokenizer based on a VQ-VAE variant to encode diverse e-commerce queries; and integration of pretrained product graph embeddings as structural priors during the denoising process.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA dual-stream discriminative architecture consisting of a BERT-based text encoder, a lightweight GNN for aggregating behavioral interaction graphs, and a prediction head trained with hierarchical contrastive learning; parameter-efficient adaptation via LoRA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInnovation Claims\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(1) Reformulates intent classification as a diffusion-based dynamic refinement process;\\n(2) Introduces discrete, context-aware intent tokenization to better handle long-tail domain vocabulary;\\n(3) Enhances intent reasoning by incorporating product graph structural embeddings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(1) Contextualized intent modeling via joint reasoning over text and behavioral graphs;\\n(2) Hierarchical contrastive learning leveraging product taxonomies;\\n(3) Parameter-efficient system design achieving strong performance at reduced computational cost.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 1: \\nComparison of research patterns generated by Idea2Story and a direct LLM baseline,\\nboth starting from the same underspecified user input:\\n\\u201cI want to build an e-commerce agent that can better understand user intent.\\u201d\\nThe table contrasts how different generation mechanisms transform the same vague research intent\\ninto concrete research patterns.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.4 Qualitative Comparison of Generated Research Patterns\\n\\nWe further compare the quality of research patterns generated by Idea2Story and a direct LLM\\nbaseline. Both systems start from the same underspecified user input and produce structured\\nresearch proposals, enabling a controlled comparison of how different generation mechanisms\\ntransform vague research intent into concrete research patterns.\\n\\n\\nTable 1 presents a side-by-side comparison of representative outputs along multiple dimensions,\\nincluding problem formulation, methodological structure, and innovation claims. Rather than\\nevaluating surface-level writing quality, the comparison focuses on the resulting research\\npatterns as methodological blueprints\\u2014i.e., how the generated ideas frame the research problem,\\nidentify gaps in prior work, and organize methodological components into a coherent approach. As shown in the table, Idea2Story tends to induce higher-level problem reformulation, transforming\\nintent understanding from a fixed classification task into a dynamic structural reasoning process.\\nThe resulting research pattern emphasizes generative refinement, structural priors, and evolving\\nrepresentations. In contrast, the direct LLM baseline largely operates within a conventional task\\nformulation, proposing a stronger system through the integration of additional components such as\\ncontext modeling and hierarchical objectives.\\n\\n\\nTo reduce evaluation bias, the generated research stories from both approaches are subsequently\\nassessed by an independent large language model (Gemini 3 Pro) (team2025gemma), which is not involved in either generation process. The evaluator is instructed to compare the outputs in terms of novelty, methodological substance, and overall research quality, without access to the generation method\\nused. Across all evaluated cases, the externally evaluated results consistently favor the outputs\\ngenerated by Idea2Story. In particular, the research stories produced by direct LLM generation tend\\nto remain at a high level of abstraction, with less concrete methodological grounding and reliance\\non relatively standard techniques. In contrast, Idea2Story-generated research patterns exhibit\\nclearer problem framing, more specific methodological structures, and stronger signals of novelty.\\n\\n\\n\", \"5 Future Work\": \"\\n\\n5 Future Work\\n\\nWhile Idea2Story focuses on grounding vague research intent into structured and high-quality research patterns, an important direction for future work is to extend this framework toward a fully closed-loop research generation pipeline. A promising extension is the integration of experiment-driven agents that can instantiate, validate, and iteratively refine generated research patterns through empirical feedback, including automated experimental design, dataset selection, and preliminary execution. Experimental outcomes can then serve as additional signals to refine the instantiated research stories, forming a feedback loop between method design and empirical validation. Beyond experimentation, future work may further explore how refined research patterns can be systematically translated into complete paper drafts, covering method descriptions, experimental results, and discussion sections. By grounding paper generation in empirically validated research patterns, such a system could move beyond surface-level text generation and provide more faithful, end-to-end support for executable and publishable scientific discovery.\\n\\n\", \"6 Conclusion\": \"\\n\\n6 Conclusion\\n\\nWe presented Idea2Story, a pre-computation\\u2013driven framework for autonomous scientific discovery that shifts literature understanding from runtime reasoning to offline knowledge structuring. By explicitly extracting reusable method units and organizing them into a continuously updated knowledge graph, Idea2Story enables research agents to reason over stable research patterns rather than repeatedly processing raw papers. Our qualitative analyses and comparative studies show that this design leads to research patterns with clearer problem reformulation, stronger methodological structure, and higher conceptual novelty than direct LLM generation. These results highlight the importance of explicit pattern modeling as a foundation for scalable and reliable autonomous research. Looking ahead, integrating Idea2Story with experimental agents to close the loop from abstract research patterns to validated empirical results represents a promising direction toward fully autonomous and trustworthy scientific discovery.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"}, \"bibliography\": {}, \"domain\": \"cs.CE\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"315ab431-c9ed-4936-91e1-0789192274e0\", \"authors\": [\"Christopher Willby\", \"Tomohiro Hashizume\", \"Jason Crain\", \"Dieter Jaksch\"], \"title\": \"Symplectic Optimization on Gaussian States\", \"abstract\": \"Computing Gaussian ground states via variational optimization is challenging because the covariance matrices must satisfy the uncertainty principle, rendering constrained or Riemannian optimization costly, delicate, and thus difficult to scale, particularly in large and inhomogeneous systems.

A lack of diversity in datasets and models can\nhinder the usefulness of ml in many critical applications, e.g. scienti\ufb01c discovery. It\nis therefore important to be able to measure diversity.\nMany diversity metrics have been proposed in ML, but these metrics are often\ndomain-speci\ufb01c and limited in \ufb02exibility. These include metrics that de\ufb01ne diversity\nin terms of a reference dataset (Heusel et al., 2017; Sajjadi et al., 2018), a pre-\n1Code for calculating the Vendi Score is available at https://github.com/vertaix/Vendi-Score .\n2trained classi\ufb01er (Salimans et al., 2016; Srivastava et al., 2017), or discrete features,\nlike n-grams (Li et al., 2016). In this paper, we propose a general, reference-free\napproach that de\ufb01nes diversity in terms of a user-speci\ufb01ed similarity function.\nOur approach is based on work in ecology, where biological diversity has been\nde\ufb01ned as the exponential of the entropy of the distribution of species within a\npopulation (Hill, 1973; Jost, 2006; Leinster, 2021). This value can be interpreted\nas the effective number of species in the population. To adapt this approach to ML,\nwe de\ufb01ne the diversity of a collection of elements x1, . . . , xnas the exponential of\nthe entropy of the eigenvalues of the n\u0002nsimilarity matrix K, whose entries are\nequal to the similarity scores between each pair of elements. This entropy can be\nseen as the von Neumann entropy associated with K(Bengtsson and \u02d9Zyczkowski,\n2017), so we call our metric the Vendi Score , for the von Neumann diversity.\nContributions. We summarize our contributions as follows:\n\u2022We extend ecological diversity to ML, and propose the Vendi Score, a metric for\nevaluating diversity in ML. We study the properties of the Vendi Score, which\nprovides us with a more formal understanding of desiderata for diversity.\n\u2022We showcase the \ufb02exibility and wide applicability of the Vendi Score, char-\nacteristics that stem from its sole reliance on the sample to be evaluated for\ndiversity and a user-de\ufb01ned similarity function, and highlight the shortcom-\nings of existing metrics used to measure diversity in different domains.\n2 Are We Measuring Diversity Correctly in ML?\nSeveral existing metrics for diversity rely on a reference distribution or dataset.\nThese reference-based metrics de\ufb01ne diversity in terms of coverage of the reference.\nThey assume access to an embedding function\u2013such as a pretrained Inception\nmodel (Szegedy et al., 2016)\u2013that maps samples to real-valued vectors. One example\nof a reference-based metric is Fr\u00e9chet Inception distance (\ufb01d) (Heusel et al., 2017),\nwhich measures the Wasserstein-2 distance between two Gaussian distributions, one\nGaussian \ufb01t to the embeddings of the reference sample and another one \ufb01t to the\nembeddings of the sample to be evaluated for diversity. \ufb01d was originally proposed\nfor evaluating image generative adversarial networks (gans) but has since been\napplied to text (C\u00edfka et al., 2018) and molecules (Preuer et al., 2018) using domain-\nspeci\ufb01c neural network encoders. Sajjadi et al. (2018) proposed a two-metric\nevaluation paradigm using precision and recall, with precision measuring quality\nand recall measuring diversity in terms of coverage of the reference distribution.\nSeveral other variations of precision and recall have been proposed (Kynk\u00e4\u00e4nniemi\net al., 2019; Simon et al., 2019; Naeem et al., 2020).

Implementing such continually learning systems have several challenges, one of which is the large memory requirement of gradient-based algorithms that are used to train state-of-the-art LLMs. Evolutionary Strategies (ES) have recently re-emerged as a gradient-free alternative to traditional learning algorithms and have shown encouraging performance on specific tasks in LLMs. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of ES and specifically evaluate its forgetting curves when training for an increasing number of update steps. We first find that ES is able to reach performance numbers close to GRPO for math and reasoning tasks with a comparable compute budget. However, and most importantly for continual learning, the performance gains in ES is accompanied by significant forgetting of prior abilities, limiting its applicability for training models online. We also explore the reason behind this behavior and show that the updates made using ES are much less sparse and have orders of magnitude larger $\\\\ell_2$ norm compared to corresponding GRPO updates, explaining the contrasting forgetting curves between the two algorithms. With this study, we aim to highlight the issue of forgetting in gradient-free algorithms like ES and hope to inspire future work to mitigate these issues.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20861v1\", \"timestamp\": 1769626774, \"sections\": {\"1 Introduction\": \"\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nDespite rapid advances in AI with transformer-based LLMs (Vaswani et al., 2017; Brown et al., 2020; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2024), most state-of-the-art systems remain static after training and lack the ability to learn continually during deployment. In many real-world settings, models need to adapt to new tasks, user preferences, or data distributions to perform optimally. While modern chatbots like ChatGPT do this by taking notes in the form of user memory OpenAI (2024) and use in-context learning Brown et al. (2020) to incorporate this information, we currently lack solutions that can achieve this by modifying the model weights during deployment. One of the reasons that makes this challenging is that current post-training and adaptation methods for LLMs are exclusively gradient-based, including approaches such as SFT Wei et al. (2022), RLHF (Ouyang et al., 2022), DPO Rafailov et al. (2024), and GRPO (Shao et al., 2024). While effective, these methods require storing gradients, optimizer states, or intermediate activations, causing substantial memory overhead.\\n\\n\\nEvolutionary Strategies (ES) Qiu et al. (2025); Korotyshova et al. (2025) have recently re-emerged as a gradient-free alternative for optimizing LLMs. By estimating updates through population-level perturbations rather than backpropagation, ES avoids explicit gradient storage and can significantly reduce memory requirements during deployment. Qiu et al. (2025) have shown that ES achieves comparable performance to GRPO on the Countdown task Pan (2026), presenting ES as a viable candidate for continual learning in LLMs. However, a more comprehensive analysis on task generalization was missing in their work. More importantly from the perspective of continual learning, Qiu et al. (2025) do not evaluate the extent to which ES preserves existing capabilities while learning new tasks.\\n\\n\\nIn this work, we present a comprehensive empirical analysis of ES for fine-tuning LLMs, with a focus on continual learning and forgetting. We compare ES against GRPO on multiple math and reasoning benchmarks and evaluate forgetting curves over many update steps. Our results confirm that ES is able to reach performance levels comparable to GRPO on a large suite of tasks; however, contrary to results reported in Qiu et al. (2025), we find that GRPO still dominates ES marginally on almost all tasks. Additionally, we show that training LLMs using ES leads to significant model degradation and forgetting of existing abilities when compared to GRPO. To better understand this behavior, we analyze the structure of parameter updates produced by ES and compare them to those obtained using GRPO. We find that ES updates are significantly less sparse and exhibit much larger \\u21132\\\\ell_{2} norms, leading to more global parameter changes that interfere with previously learned capabilities.\\n\\n\\nOur findings highlight that although ES presents a tempting memory-efficient and gradient-free alternative to inference-time model adaptation, it is also accompanied by \\u201ccatastrophic\\u201d forgetting Kirkpatrick et al.

(2025); Sarkar et al. (2025).\\nQiu et al. (2025) recently published a novel implementation of ES and showed that it outperforms GRPO. However, their study lacked a thorough analysis of model degradation during continued training. Additionally, a bulk of their study was focused on a single dataset. We extend their analysis to multiple datasets, evaluate model degradation during fine-tuning and also study the difference in weight updates in ES when compared to GRPO.\\n\\n\", \"3 Experiments\": \"\\n\\n3 Experiments\\n\\n\\n3.1 ES vs GRPO Comparison\\n\\nWe use the ES implementation of Qiu et al. (2025) and compare it with the GRPO Shao et al. (2024) implementation from the VERL libary (Sheng et al., 2025). An algorithmic analogy between the ES and GRPO algorithms can be found in A.1 while implementations details can be found in A.2. We extend the analysis of ES and GRPO to three math and reasoning tasks \\u2013 GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) and OlympiadBench (He et al., 2024), in addition to the Countdown dataset which was extensively studied in prior work Qiu et al. (2025). We perform this study for two models: Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct (Qwen et al., 2024) and Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct (Grattafiori et al., 2024). Following the experimental conditions of Qiu et al. (2025), we train our models on 200 examples from each dataset with identical batch size and number of rollouts.\\n\\n\\nThe results for comparison between ES and GRPO for fine-tuning LLMs can be found in Table 1. We see that for both models, ES is within 3-4 percentage points of GRPO in terms of task performance. These results are in contrast to prior work by Qiu et al. (2025), who claim that ES significantly outperforms GRPO on the Countdown task. In our experiments, we see that although ES performance numbers are close to GRPO, GRPO still outperforms ES for all but the GSM8K dataset with Llama-3.2-1B model. Therefore, we find different relative performance trends than those reported in prior work, which may stem from differences in GRPO implementations, hyperparameter choices, or evaluation protocols. We release our codebase and open source our trained models for reference.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nModel\\nTask\\nES\\nGRPO\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQwen-2.5-1.5B\\n(Instruct)\\n\\nCountdown\\n53.0\\n56.4\\n\\n\\nGSM8K\\n77.4\\n80.4\\n\\n\\nMATH\\n59.1\\n63.2\\n\\n\\nOlympiadBench\\n15.2\\n18.2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLlama-3.2-1B\\n(Instruct)\\n\\nCountdown\\n15.2\\n37.6\\n\\n\\nGSM8K\\n55.2\\n53.8\\n\\n\\nMATH\\n32.2\\n35.6\\n\\n\\nOlympiadBench\\n5.6\\n5.9\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 1: Peak validation accuracy (%) across tasks and models using previously found optimal hyperparameters. The same hyperparameters were used across ES runs and across GRPO runs.\\n\\n\\nThe fact that the performance numbers of ES are comparable to a state-of-the-art post-training algorithm like GRPO is very encouraging and establishes ES as a potential gradient-free alternative to training LLMs. We also see that for all tasks except Countdown, ES is able to reach peak performance in similar number of update steps, which is shown in Figure A3. This makes the compute requirements of ES also comparable to GRPO.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2 ES and Catastrophic Forgetting\\n\\nWhile Section 3.1 shows that ES performs competitively with GRPO on various downstream tasks, a defining factor in the viability of using a fine-tuning algorithm for continual learning is its relationship with catastrophic forgetting. We utilized Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct trained on the Countdown dataset with GRPO and ES to evaluate catastrophic forgetting. HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019) was used to evaluate LLMs on their prior capabilities. In an ideal scenario, performance on previous tasks should be preserved as new capability is gained. We thus evaluate task performance across each checkpoint of our trained models.\\n\\n\\nFigure 1: Pareto front between new task (Countdown) and old task (HellaSwag) performance across fine-tuning with ES and GRPO.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: Prior task accuracy (%; HellaSwag) vs. training iteration for ES and GRPO fine-tuning. GRPO-trained models exhibit stable prior task accuracy across training iteration, while ES-trained models degrade with continued fine-tuning.\\n\\n\\nFigure\\u00a01 illustrates the relationship between new-task performance (Countdown) and prior-task performance (HellaSwag) across fine-tuning iterations. When training with ES, prior-task performance systematically deteriorates as fine-tuning proceeds, even after new-task performance has effectively converged. This can observed in the convex Pareto front made by ES in Figure\\u00a01. The darker color dots, which depict early training iterations begin with a lower \\u201cNew Task Accuracy\\u201d. With enough training iterations, the increase in \\u201cNew Task Accuracy\\u201d for ES is accompanied by a gradual but evident decline in \\u201cPrior Task Accuracy\\u201d. Additionally, ES models reach near-maximum Countdown performance by approximately 200 iterations, after which additional training yields negligible gains on the new task. As shown in Figure 2, despite this convergence, previous task performance continues to decline with further iterations, resulting in an approximately 10% drop relative to the best observed prior-task performance. This pattern indicates that continued ES optimization disproportionately harms previously acquired capabilities, rather than trading off against improvements on the new task.\\n\\n\\nIn contrast, models fine-tuned with GRPO exhibit markedly different behavior. Across the full range of training iterations, GRPO maintains stable previous task performance while achieving strong new task accuracy. This can be seen by the cluster of crosses on the top-right corner of Figure\\u00a01. This suggests that GRPO avoids the destructive interference observed with ES. This property of GRPO has also been observed in prior work Shenfeld et al. (2025).\\n\\n\\nTherefore, we see that although ES-trained models can be competitive to GRPO, they do so at the cost of severe catastrophic forgetting. Notably, this forgetting occurs within a single fine-tuning run rather than across sequential tasks, highlighting a fundamental instability in ES-based continual adaptation. These results suggest that ES is poorly suited for scenarios requiring task generalization or reuse of previously learned capabilities, whereas GRPO provides a substantially more stable fine-tuning regime.\\n\\n\\nFigure 3: \\nRelationship between Frobenius norm of a model update and number of training iterations on a new task. ES-trained models drift several orders of magnitude more than GRPO-trained models.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3 Dissecting ES Updates: Norm and Sparsity\\n\\nIn this section, we seek to determine the characteristics of fine-tuning with ES that cause catastrophic forgetting. We do this by analyzing two features: the update norm and sparsity.\\n\\n\\nNorm.\\n\\nHere we investigate norm growth of the updated matrix as a function of number of updates with ES and GRPO. We measure the Frobenius norm between model checkpoints within a training run. We do this for the Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model trained on the Countdown dataset.\\n\\n\\nThe results are shown in Figure\\u00a03. The Frobenius norm increases monotonically with the number of training iterations for ES-trained models. A similar trend is also present for GRPO-trained models (Figure A2); however, the key distinction lies in scale. After just 500 training iteration, the Frobenius norm of the ES-trained model relative to the base model is three orders of magnitude larger than the GRPO-trained model. When combined with what we learn from Figure 2, we see a clear association between the large increases in ES Frobenius norm and a decline in prior task accuracy. Thus, ES updates have significantly higher \\u21132\\\\ell_{2} norm difference, causing orders or magnitiude larger parameter-shifts compared to GRPO.\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 4: \\nLayerwise sparsity of parameter updates during fine-tuning (higher indicates more sparse updates).\\nES exhibits broadly distributed, dense updates across components, whereas GRPO updates are overall highly sparse across LLM parameter groups, consistent with more targeted parameter changes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSparsity.\\n\\nEach update in ES is constructed from high-variance, global perturbations applied across all parameters, which may affect a large number of stored parameters uniformly. In contrast, it is known that GRPO applies much sparser and targeted updates via backpropagation, limiting the extent of unintended parameter drift Mukherjee et al. (2025). To check the difference in the number of parameters affected by these algorithms, we evaluate the update sparsity in ES when compared to GRPO.\\n\\n\\nWe analyze Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct trained on the Countdown task with both GRPO and ES. We analyze the difference between a base model checkpoint and its corresponding fine-tuned checkpoint. For each shared parameter tensor, we compute the update \\u0394\\u200bW=Wn\\u200be\\u200bw\\u2212Wb\\u200ba\\u200bs\\u200be\\\\Delta W=W_{new}-W_{base}. Following prior work Mukherjee et al. (2025), we define sparsity as the percentage of elements whose absolute magnitude is below a fixed threshold (\\u03c4=10\\u22126\\\\tau=10^{-6}). Therefore, higher sparsity values mean a larger number of parameters are below this threshold, which means that the updates are more sparse. Parameters are grouped by architectural component, including attention projections (Q,K,V)(Q,K,V), the attention output projection (WO)(W_{O}), MLP layers and LayerNorms. Updates are further aggregated by transformer layer index to obtain layerwise sparsity profiles.\\n\\n\\nThe results are shown in Figure 4. We see that ES updates are substantially less sparse across layers and parameter groups when compared to GRPO. The sparsity levels for GRPO updates across all parameter types and layers are close to 95%, which means updates are concentrated around a very small number of parameters. However, the updates using ES have very low sparsity levels, showing that a much larger number of parameters are perturbed when fine-tuning with ES. The most sparse updates in ES appear for LayerNorm; however it also contains the least (and neglible) number of parameters compared to other parts of the model. Other layer updates, irrespective of model depth, are highly dense in ES-trained models.\\n\\n\\nTherefore, GRPO exhibits structured and comparatively sparse updates, aligning with the hypothesis that gradient-based optimization concentrates changes in task-relevant subspaces and mitigates interference with prior capabilities. When combined with KL regularization, these mechanisms provide a natural safeguard against large-scale parameter drift and, consequently, catastrophic forgetting.\\nIn contrast, we see that updates using ES have orders of magnitude larger norms and are much less sparse compared to GRPO. The lack of sparsity and large update norms in ES drifts the fine-tuned model further away from the base model, potentially leading to the catastrophic forgetting behavior observed in previous sections.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"4 Conclusion\": \"\\n\\n4 Conclusion\\n\\nWe perform an empirical analysis of Evolutionary Strategies for fine-tuning LLMs based on recent work Qiu et al. (2025) and show that it performs competetively with GRPO. Although, a critical roadblock still persists: we observe that ES exhibits significant catastrophic forgetting and progressively deteriorates performance on prior skills of the model. We show that this happens because ES updates have large norms and low sparsity levels (more dense), resulting in parameter drifts that are 1000x higher in magnitude than drifts observed with GRPO for the same number of update steps. These results imply that although recent progress in ES has bridged performance gap with state-of-the-art learning algorithms like GRPO, its intense model degradation still remains a challenge before its widespread adoption.\\n\\n\", \"Limitations\": \"\\nLimitations\\n\\nES has an inherent randomness associated with the updates due to the nature of the algorithm. As a result, models trained with ES exhibit high variance in stochastic perturbations. Although we observed consistent qualitative trends across the settings we tested, where we worked with a population size of 30 as suggested in prior work Qiu et al. (2025), increased population size will decrease the variance and increase statistical stability of our performance numbers.\\n\\n\\nAdditionally, we evaluate catastrophic forgetting by tracking performance on one task during continued fine-tuning on Countdown, which measures retention of a broad prior capability. Doing so does not fully capture multi-facetted loss of performance that may be happening in the model; however, is enough to give strong evidence of the occurence of the phenomenon.\\n\\n\", \"Appendix A Appendix\": \"\\n\\nAppendix A Appendix\\n\\n\\nA.1 Algorithmic Overview and Analogy Between ES and GRPO\\n\\n\\nA.1.1 ES Algorithm Overview\\n\\nQiu et al.

The following section describes why the population size in ES and number of rollouts in GRPO play an analogous role in controlling parameter updates.\\n\\n\\nFollowing the algorithm described by Qiu et al. (2025), an ES training update comprises of NN different seeds used to generate perturbations to the baseline model, resulting in NN different population members. Each population member is sampled with temperature at 0 to generate NN different responses, which are evaluated by a reward function to determine their fitness, which is converted into a z-score to weight the contribution of that respective perturbation to the baseline model. Further explanation can be found in A.1.\\n\\n\\nSimilarly, a GRPO training update samples NN candidate outputs from the current policy, evaluates them to obtain relative reward signals, and updates the policy via a policy-gradient objective while constraining deviation from a fixed reference policy through KL regularization (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025). Crucially, although ES simultaneously maintains multiple different versions of a model and GRPO maintains one, ES population size and GRPO number of rollouts both determine the number of samples used to estimate a stochastic update and to form a stochastic gradient or gradient-free estimator that drives the parameter update.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA.2 Implementation Details\\n\\nOur implementations for both GRPO and ES model training and analysis is attached to this submission.\\n\\n\\n\\nA.2.1 GRPO\\n\\nThe GRPO setup in this study is implemented on the VERL library, which employs the HybridFlow engine proposed by Sheng et al. (2025). Training was conducted on NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs and the Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) protocol was used to train across GPUs. Across all experiments, we maintained 30 rollouts for GRPO to mimic the 30 mutations generated by the original ES study by Qiu et al. (2025). To benchmark-finetuning, we used a batch-size of 200 examples along with a mini-batch size of 32 examples. A KL-Loss coefficient of \\u03b2=0.001\\\\beta=0.001 was used. The trainer was set to run for a total of 500 epochs, although once the validation accuracy appeared to plateau, we stopped training prematurely.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA.2.2 ES\\n\\nWe replicated the original author\\u2019s implementation of ES with two improvements: the authors found that using fp16 instead of bf16 improved validation accuracy on certain tasks. Additionally, the application of the Qwen chat template to the original task prompts improved validation accuracy on the experiment replica Countdown task for Qwen2.5-1.5B, but left model performance on all other regimes virtually the same. Runs were performed both with and without the chat template to assess the effect.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA.2.3 Reward functions\\n\\nFor the countdown task, we employ the same reward function used by Qiu et al. (2025), adapted to fit the VERL API. An answer reward is calculated, which assigns a reward of 1.01.0 if the model\\u2019s answer uses all numbers once and evaluates to the provided target, and 0.00.0 otherwise. A separate format score is calculated, which serves to ensure that the model\\u2019s response obeys an XML-style format with <think>...</think> thinking tokens first followed by response tokens <answer>...</answer>. We take a weighted average of the two rewards to calculate the final reward to assign to the model: Reward=0.1\\u22c5Format\\u200bReward+0.9\\u22c5Answer\\u200bReward\\\\mathrm{Reward}=0.1\\\\cdot\\\\mathrm{Format\\\\ Reward}+0.9\\\\cdot\\\\mathrm{Answer\\\\ Reward}\\n\\n\\nFor the GSM8K, MATH, and OlympiadBench benchmarks, we employ a rule-based reward function using a binary evaluation logic. An answer reward is calculated by extracting the model\\u2019s conclusion from the final 300 characters of the response using a regex pattern. The function first identifies the #### [number] format, falling back to \\\\boxed{...} tags if necessary, and assigns a reward of 1.01.0 if the extraction matches the ground truth and 0.00.0 otherwise.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA.3 Hyperparameter Values\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHyperparameter\\nValue\\n\\n\\nPopulation size\\n30\\n\\n\\nNoise scale \\u03c3\\\\sigma\\n\\n0.001\\n\\n\\nLearning rate \\u03b1\\\\alpha\\n\\n0.0005\\n\\n\\nMax tokens\\n1024\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 2: Hyperparameters used for Evolution Strategies (ES) fine-tuning.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA.4 Additional Experiments\\n\\n\\nA.4.1 Catastrophic Forgetting and KL\\n\\nFigure A1: \\nRelationship between KL divergence and task performance.\\nTop row: new-task accuracy (Countdown).\\nBottom row: prior-task accuracy (HellaSwag).

(2025) had previously established a negative correlation between KL-divergence and previous task score. We therefore searched whether this trend also is reflected within ES-trained models . We first looked at KL-divergence between the trained and base models A1 on the newly trained task. While ES-trained models increase in KL-divergence with subsequent training steps, this behavior was not consistent when trained with GRPO. This can be attributed to the explicit KL-regularization factor in GRPO, preventing continuous drifts from the base model.\\n\\n\\nThe trends for KL divergence and accuracy continue to diverge when evaluating previously known tasks A1. ES has a clear negative correlation between KL-divergence and old task performance. The KL-divergence between the new and base models also shows an increase over number of training iterations in ES. GRPO however continues to show no association between number of training steps and KL-divergence, as well as between KL-divergence and previous task accuracy. Therefore, KL-divergence is a less reliable indicator of catastrophic convergence across GRPO and ES.\\n\\n\\nFigure A2: \\nLog relationship between Frobenius norm of a model update and number of training iterations on a new task (Countdown).

Generative modeling is no exception. Generally, this class of models aims to estimate the underlying distribution of the data. Existing generative flavors encompass variational inference\\u00a0[18, 11, 33], generative adversarial networks\\u00a0[8] and score-based matching\\u00a0[37]. Despite mostly focusing on data modalities such as image\\u00a0[2] and text\\u00a0[24], there has been a recent surge of interest in generative models for tabular data. The interest lies in generating synthetic data to overcome challenges such as data scarcity, missing-value imputation, and individual privacy-preserving (see e.g.,\\u00a0[30] for a thorough review).\\n\\n\\nChallenges in tabular data generation\\n\\nModeling the joint distribution of tabular data has unique challenges. The main research interest in the generative model is on images, and, usually, the theory behind it assumes a continuous distribution of the data. This is not true for tabular data, which generally presents a mixture of both continuous and discrete variables. Moreover, continuous variables might exhibit several modes, and discrete variables may have a considerable number of categories, imposing additional challenges on the capability of a neural network to learn relationships between these two different types of data adequately.\\n\\n\\n\\nTokenization\\n\\nA data point of a tabular dataset is usually represented as a heterogeneous vector composed of numerical and discrete features. One possible solution to overcome this heterogeneity is to embed each feature into an embedding matrix via tokenization\\u00a0[9, 44]. In essence, this transformation linearly projects each feature into a continuous vector.\\n\\n\\n\\nTransformers\\n\\nThe Transformer architecture\\u00a0[39] was initially proposed for machine translation and later applied to text generation\\u00a0[31]. Given its unprecedented success, adaptations have been made to this architecture in the past few years for images\\u00a0[15], time series\\u00a0[41], and, naturally, tabular data\\u00a0[13, 36, 44]. In the tabular domain, the purpose of the Transformer architecture is to capture meaningful relations between feature representations of the data via attention mechanisms.\\n\\n\\n\\nMotivation\\n\\nTransformers are becoming a fundamental architectural block to model feature interactions in tabular data on different learning paradigms\\u00a0[36, 9, 44]. Typically, they operate on a \\u201craw\\u201d level of representation, i.e., at the data input level. In this work, we question its use to leverage abstract representations of a Neural Network, i.e., feature representations obtained by fully connected layers followed by nonlinearities. A prominent architecture for this study is the Variational Autoencoder (VAE), which encompasses three distinct kinds of representations: 1) an input representation that is fed into the recognition model (encoder); 2) a latent representation modeled via the statistics obtained by the recognition model; and 3) a reconstructed representation obtained by the generative model (decoder) (see Fig.\\u00a01). Fully Connected (FC) layers, which are affine maps, do not capture high-order dependencies between feature representations that may become important at deeper feature representations. The Transformer attention mechanism provides a suitable alternative to model these dependencies.\\n\\n\\n\\nOur Contribution\\n\\nThis work evaluates the impact of Transformers in a VAE for tabular data generation. We aim to answer the following question \\u2014 What\\u2019s the impact of integrating Transformers into different components of a VAE?\\nStarting with a VAE without Transformers, we study the effect of leveraging it over the aforementioned representations. In total, 6 variations are considered. This evaluation is performed by considering metrics that evaluate the statistical properties of the synthetic data with respect to the real data and through a Machine-Learning utility perspective. In addition, Center Kernel Alignment (CKA)\\u00a0[20] is used to compare similarities between feature representations on different components of the architectures. Our experiments are conducted using 57 datasets from the OpenML CC18 suite\\u00a0[3].\\n\\n\\nFrom an evaluation perspective, our study reveals a trade-off between fidelity and diversity of the synthetic data with respect to real data. Specifically, we observe that as Transformers are added into the architecture, synthetic data tends to be less faithful to real data, while its diversity increases, with the biggest gain obtained when leveraging the latent and output representations with Transformers. From a representational perspective, our findings reveal that the input and output of Transformers at both the encoder and decoder tend to present a high degree of similarity. Moreover, at the decoder, the Transformer appears to act as the identity function due to little or no effects in representational changes in residual connections. We observe that the reason for this effect is due to layer normalization, which shifts and scales the initial representation such that it offers no representational changes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work. Section 3 introduces the necessary formulations and provides an overview of the considered VAE models for the study. The experimental setup is outlined in Section 4, followed by an analysis of the experimental results in Section 5. Section 6 presents a detailed study on the similarities between feature representations at different levels of the architectures. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 7.\\n\\n\\n\", \"2 Related Work\": \"\\n\\n2 Related Work\\n\\nRecent advances in tabular data generation draw upon a variety of deep generative approaches. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) such as CTGAN [43] and its successors CTAB-GAN [45] and CTAB-GAN+ [46] adapt GAN-based frameworks to handle continuous and categorical features. Meanwhile, Diffusion Models [35, 11] have been specialized for tabular data through methods like TabDDPM [21], CoDi [22], StaSy [16], TabSyn [44], and TabDiff [34], each proposing distinct strategies to manage mixed data types and improve generative quality. Autoregressive models like GReaT\\u00a0[4] and TabMT\\u00a0[10] have also been considered in the tabular data generation framework. Flow-Matching [25] has led to novel gradient-boosting-based generative solutions [14]. Finally, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) [18] adaptations include TVAE\\u00a0[43], introduced alongside CTGAN, and VAEM\\u00a0[27], which consists of a two-stage training \\u2014 the first independently trains each feature using a VAE, while the second model\\u2019s the inter-variable dependencies using the latent variables learned from the first stage. Another variation, GOGGLE\\u00a0[26], was introduced as a generative model that approximates relational structure between variables via Graph Neural Networks, jointly training these relations with a VAE.\\n\\n\\nTransformers in Tabular Data Generation\\n\\nThe Transformer architecture has been explored as a means to capture feature relationships in tabular data generation. For example, TabDiff employs a Transformer both in the backbone and at the denoiser output, whereas TabSyn leverages Transformers to model the statistics of the recognition model and the generative distribution of a VAE. Nevertheless, a thorough examination of how Transformers affect data quality remains an open question. In this work, we attempt to fill this gap.\\n\\n\\n\", \"3 Formulation and Methods\": \"\\n\\n3 Formulation and Methods\\n\\nFigure 1: Left: Illustration of an embedding based VAE architecture.

A feature tokenizer takes as input a data point and projects it into a (M\\u00d7d)(M\\\\times d)-dimensional space as:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nei(num)=xi(num)\\u200bwi(num)+bi(num)ei(cat)=xi(ohe)\\u200bWi(cat)+bi(cat),\\\\begin{split}\\\\textbf{e}_{i}^{(\\\\text{num})}&=x_{i}^{(\\\\text{num})}\\\\textbf{w}_{i}^{(\\\\text{num})}+\\\\textbf{b}_{i}^{(\\\\text{num})}\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\textbf{e}_{i}^{(\\\\text{cat})}&=\\\\textbf{x}_{i}^{(\\\\text{ohe})}\\\\textbf{W}_{i}^{(\\\\text{cat})}+\\\\textbf{b}_{i}^{(\\\\text{cat})}\\\\end{split}~~,\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere wi(num),bi(num),bi(cat)\\u2208\\u211d1\\u00d7d\\\\textbf{w}_{i}^{(\\\\text{num})},\\\\textbf{b}_{i}^{(\\\\text{num})},\\\\textbf{b}_{i}^{(\\\\text{cat})}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{1\\\\times d} and Wi(cat)\\u2208\\u211d|Cj|\\u00d7d\\\\textbf{W}_{i}^{(\\\\text{cat})}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{|C_{j}|\\\\times d}. In other words, each numerical feature is projected into a vector space where each sample shares the same weights, while for categorical features, this tokenization acts as a lookup table, i.e., each category has its own set of learnable weights. In the end, x is represented as the embedding matrix E\\u2208\\u211dM\\u00d7d\\\\textbf{E}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{M\\\\times d} by concatenating each ei\\\\textbf{e}_{i} along the feature dimension, E=\\u2a01i=1Mei\\\\textbf{E}=\\\\mathop{\\\\bigoplus}_{i=1}^{M}\\\\textbf{e}_{i}.\\n\\n\\n\\nFeature Detokenizer\\n\\nGiven a reconstructed embedding matrix E~\\u2208\\u211dM\\u00d7d\\\\tilde{\\\\textbf{E}}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{M\\\\times d}, the reconstructed representation x~\\\\tilde{\\\\textbf{x}} is obtained by projecting each embedding vector ei\\\\textbf{e}_{i} back to the feature space as\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nx~i(num)=e~i(num)\\u200bw~i(num)+b~i(num)x~i(ohe)=Softmax\\u200b(e~i(cat)\\u200bW~i(cat)+\\ud835\\udc83~i(cat)),\\\\begin{split}\\\\tilde{x}_{i}^{(\\\\text{num})}&=\\\\tilde{\\\\textbf{e}}_{i}^{(\\\\text{num})}\\\\tilde{\\\\textbf{w}}_{i}^{(\\\\text{num})}+\\\\tilde{b}_{i}^{(\\\\text{num})}\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\tilde{\\\\textbf{x}}_{i}^{(\\\\text{ohe})}&=\\\\text{Softmax}\\\\left(\\\\tilde{\\\\textbf{e}}_{i}^{(\\\\text{cat})}\\\\tilde{\\\\textbf{W}}_{i}^{(\\\\text{cat})}+\\\\tilde{\\\\boldsymbol{b}}_{i}^{(\\\\text{cat})}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{split}~~,\\n\\n(4)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwith b~i(num)\\u2208\\u211d1\\u00d71\\\\tilde{b}_{i}^{(\\\\text{num})}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{1\\\\times 1}, w~i(num)\\u2208\\u211dd\\u00d71,\\ud835\\udc83~i(cat)\\u2208\\u211d1\\u00d7|Cj|\\\\tilde{\\\\textbf{w}}_{i}^{(\\\\text{num})}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d\\\\times 1},~\\\\tilde{\\\\boldsymbol{b}}_{i}^{(\\\\text{cat})}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{1\\\\times|C_{j}|} and W~i(cat)\\u2208\\u211dd\\u00d7|Cj|\\\\tilde{\\\\textbf{W}}_{i}^{(\\\\text{cat})}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d\\\\times|C_{j}|}.\\nIn the end, we concatenate every reconstructed feature\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nx~=(x~1(num),\\u2026,x~Mn(num),x~1(ohe),\\u2026,x~Mc(ohe)).\\\\tilde{\\\\textbf{x}}=\\\\left(\\\\tilde{x}_{1}^{(\\\\text{num})},...,\\\\tilde{x}_{M_{n}}^{(\\\\text{num})},\\\\tilde{\\\\textbf{x}}_{1}^{(\\\\text{ohe})},...,\\\\tilde{\\\\textbf{x}}_{M_{c}}^{(\\\\text{ohe})}\\\\right)~~.\\n\\n(5)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2 Self-Attention\\n\\nThe main component of the Transformer architecture (cf. right image of Fig.\\u00a01) is the attention mechanism. In the context of tabular data, its purpose is to capture relationships between variables in the embedding space. In our work, this is accomplished via dot-product attention. These interactions go through a Softmax non-linearity to normalize the contribution of all features with respect to a given one. Letting Q=WQ\\u200bE\\\\textbf{Q}=\\\\textbf{W}_{\\\\textbf{Q}}\\\\textbf{E}, K=WK\\u200bE\\\\textbf{K}=\\\\textbf{W}_{\\\\textbf{K}}\\\\textbf{E}, V=WV\\u200bE\\\\textbf{V}=\\\\textbf{W}_{\\\\textbf{V}}\\\\textbf{E} be a set of query, key and values, respectively, the attention mechanism outputs the weighted sum of values V\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAttention\\u200b(Q,K,V)=Softmax\\u200b(QKTdk)\\u200bV,\\\\text{Attention}(\\\\textbf{Q},\\\\textbf{K},\\\\textbf{V})=\\\\text{Softmax}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\textbf{Q}\\\\textbf{K}^{T}}{d_{k}}\\\\right)\\\\textbf{V}~~,\\n\\n(6)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere dkd_{k} is the embedding dimensionality of K.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3 Models\\n\\nThe models under study in this work are summarized in Table\\u00a01 and follow the scheme illustrated in the first image of Fig.\\u00a01. An initial implementation that leverages embeddings at the input and output, but without Transformers, is considered, and we call it VAE. The following models consider Transformers acting at the backbone of the encoder, the latent space, and the decoder head. The different parts of the network where these Transformers are included are explicitly shown in the middle image of Fig.\\u00a01. We detail a forward pass of the architecture that leverages Transformers over all the considered (ELD-VAE) in the Supplemental Material. The remainder of the architectures share the same encoder and decoder components, except where the Transformer acts. For a review of the theory behind Variational Autoencoders, we recommend the readers to\\u00a0[19].\\n\\n\\nTable 1: Architectures under study in this work.\\n\\n\\n\\nModel (Abbreviation)\\nTransformer on:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnc(oder)\\nLat(ent)\\nDec(oder)\\n\\n\\nVAE (VAE)\\n\\u2717\\n\\u2717\\n\\u2717\\n\\n\\nEnc-VAE (E-VAE)\\n\\u2713\\n\\u2717\\n\\u2717\\n\\n\\nEnc-Lat-VAE (EL-VAE)\\n\\u2713\\n\\u2713\\n\\u2717\\n\\n\\nEnc-Lat-Dec-VAE (ELD-VAE)\\n\\u2713\\n\\u2713\\n\\u2713\\n\\n\\nLat-Dec-VAE (LD-VAE)\\n\\u2717\\n\\u2713\\n\\u2713\\n\\n\\nDec-VAE (D-VAE)\\n\\u2717\\n\\u2717\\n\\u2713\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"4 Experimental Setup\": \"\\n\\n4 Experimental Setup\\n\\n\\n4.1 Datasets\\n\\nWe use the OpenML CC18 suite\\u00a0[3] as a benchmark to evaluate the methods presented in this paper. It is composed of 72 datasets used for classification tasks. From this benchmark, we select 57 datasets that encompass samples and feature dimensions in the range between N\\u2208[500,96320]N\\\\in[500,96320] and M\\u2208[4,240]M\\\\in[4,240], respectively. For all datasets, the train and test splits provided by the OpenML CC18 suite are used, and finally, we extract 15% of the training set, which serves as our validation set. We observed training instabilities in three of the considered datasets, which we detail in the Supplemental Material.\\n\\n\\nFor all datasets, the following pre-processing is applied: 1) we begin by dropping features that only contain missing values, and numerical or categorical features with 0 variance or only one category, respectively; 2) numerical and categorical columns with missing values are replaced with the mean and mode, respectively; 3) numerical variables are encoded using a quantile Transformer with a Gaussian distribution\\u00a0111https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.QuantileTransformer.html based on previous works\\u00a0[44, 34], while categorical variables are encoded using one-hot encoding.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.2 Training and Sampling Details\\n\\nEach model is trained under 500 epochs with the Adam optimizer [17], using a weight decay of 0.90.9 and a learning rate of 1\\u00d710\\u221231\\\\times 10^{-3}. The batch size is determined by following simple rules, given the validation set. The tokenizer, detokenizer, hidden, and latent layers weights are initialized with the same values for all models, and if two architectures share the same Transformer location, so the Transformer.\\n\\n\\nRegarding model hyperparameters, we keep them constant over all datasets and models. Each Transformer is defined with one head, four blocks\\u00a0222In the Supplemental Material, we study the effect of lowering the number of blocks in terms of high-density estimation metrics., a hidden dimension of 128, and without dropout. By recommendation\\u00a0[9], we also use its pre-norm variation\\u00a0[40]. An embedding dimension of d=4d=4 is considered following previous works\\u00a0[44]. The fully connected layers of the encoder and decoder have a hidden dimension of H=128H=128, while the latent dimension is L=64L=64, unless stated otherwise.\\n\\n\\nAfter training, we sample over the latent as z\\u223c\\ud835\\udca9\\u200b(\\ud835\\udfce,I)\\\\textbf{z}\\\\sim\\\\mathcal{N}(\\\\boldsymbol{0},\\\\textbf{I}). In our experiments, the number of synthetic samples is the same size as the training data.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3 Evaluation Metrics\\n\\nThe synthetic data produced by the generative models under study are evaluated using several metrics found in the literature. We divide the considered metrics into three groups: 1)\\u00a0Low-Density Estimation, where 1-way marginals and pairwise-correlations measurements are considered to estimate differences between feature distributions; 2)\\u00a0High-Density Estimation, which compares the joint probability distributions of synthetic and real data; 3)\\u00a0Machine Learning-Efficiency, aiming to determine the usefulness of synthetic data in downstream tasks such as classification.\\n\\n\\nNote that all metrics are defined on a domain between [0, 1], where the higher the value, the better the model performance is.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3.1 Low-Density Estimation\\n\\nUnder this class of metrics, we consider 1-way marginals and pairwise correlations.\\n\\n\\n1-Way Marginals\\n\\nThe first metric measures how similar the (independent) feature distributions between real and synthetic data are. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic\\u00a0[12] is computed for numerical columns, under the null hypothesis that real and synthetic data are drawn from the same probability distribution, while the Total Variation Distance\\u00a0[23] is applied for categorical ones. In the end, we average the similarities obtained from each feature.\\n\\n\\n\\nPairwise-Correlations\\n\\nPairwise-correlations measure the dependency between two features in a dataset. Given two columns (m1,m2)(m_{1},m_{2}) of both (x,x~)(\\\\textbf{x},\\\\tilde{\\\\textbf{x}}), if they are both numerical, we determine Pearson\\u2019s Correlation\\u00a0[28]; if they are both categorical, the Contingency Similarity; finally if they are of different types, the numerical column is partitioned into bins, and afterwards, the Contingency Similarity is applied. The score between the correlations (\\u03c1,\\u03c1~)(\\\\rho,\\\\tilde{\\\\rho}) obtained for each type of data is then determined as\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ns\\u200bc\\u200bo\\u200br\\u200be=1\\u2212|\\u03c1m1,m2\\u2212\\u03c1~m1,m2|2.score=1-\\\\frac{|\\\\rho_{m_{1},m_{2}}-\\\\tilde{\\\\rho}_{m_{1},m_{2}}|}{2}~~.\\n\\n(7)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFinally, we average all the scores obtained for each pairwise correlation. For these two first metrics, we use the implementations provided by the sdmetrics\\u00a0[38] Python package. In our experiments, we dub these metrics as low-density, as they only capture unidimensional statistics and pairwise relationships between variables.\\n\\n\\nTable 2: Average results obtained for the studied models.

We use the work from\\u00a0[1], which introduces the notion of \\u03b1\\\\alpha-Precision and \\u03b2\\\\beta-Recall. Generally speaking, \\u03b1\\\\alpha-Precision and \\u03b2\\\\beta-Recall characterize the fidelity and diversity of the generated data to the real one, respectively. While \\u03b1\\\\alpha-Precision is computed by determining the probability that a generated sample resides in the support of the real-data distribution, \\u03b2\\\\beta-Recall is computed by determining the probability that a real sample resides in the support of the synthetic data distribution. A synthetic data point x~n\\\\tilde{x}_{n} is said to reside inside the \\u03b1\\\\alpha-support of the real distribution if\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nf\\u03b1\\u200b(x~n)=\\ud835\\udfcf\\u200b{x~n\\u2208B\\u200b(cr,r\\u03b1)},f_{\\\\alpha}(\\\\tilde{x}_{n})=\\\\boldsymbol{1}\\\\{\\\\tilde{x}_{n}\\\\in\\\\textbf{B}(c_{r},r_{\\\\alpha})\\\\}~~,\\n\\n(8)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere B\\u200b(cr,r\\u03b1)\\\\textbf{B}(c_{r},r_{\\\\alpha}) is a non-parametric estimator of the support of real data, assumed to be a ball of radius r\\u03b1=Q\\u03b1{||xn\\u2212cr||:1\\u2264n\\u2264N}r_{\\\\alpha}=Q_{\\\\alpha}\\\\{||x_{n}-c_{r}||:1\\\\leq n\\\\leq N\\\\} and center cr=\\u2211i=1Mxic_{r}=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{M}x_{i}. Q\\u03b1Q_{\\\\alpha} is the \\u03b1\\\\alpha-quantile function. On the other hand, a real data point xnx_{n} is said to reside inside the \\u03b2\\\\beta-support of the synthetic distribution if\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nf\\u03b2\\u200b(xn)=\\ud835\\udfcf\\u200b{x~n\\u2217\\u03b2\\u2208B\\u200b(xn,NNDk\\u200b(xn))},f_{\\\\beta}(x_{n})=\\\\boldsymbol{1}\\\\{\\\\tilde{x}_{n^{*}}^{\\\\beta}\\\\in\\\\textbf{B}(x_{n},\\\\text{NND}_{k}(x_{n}))\\\\}~~,\\n\\n(9)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere x~n\\u2217\\u03b2\\\\tilde{x}_{n^{*}}^{\\\\beta} is the synthetic sample in the ball closest to xnx_{n}, and NNDk\\u200b(xn)\\\\text{NND}_{k}(x_{n}) the kk-nearest neighbor in \\ud835\\udc9f\\\\mathcal{D}. After averaging f\\u03b1\\u200b(x~n)f_{\\\\alpha}(\\\\tilde{x}_{n}) and f\\u03b2\\u200b(xn)f_{\\\\beta}(x_{n}) for all data points, these quantities are integrated over all (\\u03b1,\\u03b2\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)-quantiles. We use the implementation of these metrics provided by the synthcity package\\u00a0[29].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3.3 Machine Learning-Efficiency\\n\\nRegarding Machine Learning-Efficiency (ML-Efficiency), we are interested in both Utility and ML-Fidelity. The classifier taken into consideration is XGBoost\\u00a0[6]. Hyperparameters are kept constant, with a number of 500 boosters and a learning rate of 1\\u00d710\\u221221\\\\times 10^{-2}. After training a model, a real test set is evaluated using two models \\u2014 one trained over real data, \\u2133real\\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\text{real}}, and another trained over synthetic data, \\u2133syn\\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\text{syn}}. We denote predictions obtained from \\u2133real\\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\text{real}} and \\u2133syn\\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\text{syn}} as y^(real)\\\\hat{y}^{(\\\\text{real})}, y^(syn)\\\\hat{y}^{(\\\\text{syn})}, respectively.\\n\\n\\nUtility\\n\\nBy utility, we ask how well a model performs when trained over a synthetic dataset \\ud835\\udc9fsyn\\\\mathcal{D}_{\\\\text{syn}} and evaluated under a holdout set from the real dataset x(test)\\\\textbf{x}^{(\\\\text{test})}. We adopt the Train on Synthetic, Test on Real (TSTR) (e.g.\\u00a0[7]) methodology. Here, predictions are evaluated using accuracy.\\n\\n\\n\\nML-Fidelity\\n\\nBy ML-Fidelity, we ask how similar the predictions (y^(real)\\\\hat{y}^{(\\\\text{real})}, y^(syn)\\\\hat{y}^{(\\\\text{syn})}) are.

We begin by reporting results based on average results and ranks in Section\\u00a05.1. In Section\\u00a05.2, the observed trade-off between fidelity and diversity is detailed.\\n\\n\\n\\n5.1 General overview\\n\\nWe begin by reporting top performers based on average score and ranking for each metric based on the results presented in Table\\u00a02. Models with the highest average score are highlighted in bold, while those with the highest average rank are underlined. In addition, for given metrics, models with double asterisks (\\u2217\\u2217) imply that their results are statistically significant to the top performer using the Wilcoxon\\u2019s Signed Rank Test\\u00a0[42].\\n\\n\\nOverall, LD-VAE consistently excels across the considered metrics, attaining the highest average score except for \\u03b1\\\\alpha-Precision, where the E-VAE outperforms it. Although LD-VAE achieves the best mean scores on most metrics, its performance on low-density estimation and ML-Efficiency metrics does not present statistically significant differences compared to other variations. However, for high-density metrics, LD-VAE results on \\u03b2\\\\beta-Recall are statistically superior to those of all other models except ELD-VAE. In contrast, for \\u03b1\\\\alpha-Precision, the E-VAE achieves statistically significant results compared to models that leverage Transformers in the decoder (D-VAE, LD-VAE, ELD-VAE).\\n\\n\\nRanking-wise, there is no single clear winner. In low-density estimation metrics, despite LD-VAE having the highest score, the baseline VAE attains the best rank for 1-way marginals. Meanwhile, LD-VAE claims the top rank for Pairwise-Correlations. In high-density metrics, both top performers share the lowest rank; notably, the baseline VAE ties with the encoder-only variant on \\u03b1\\\\alpha-Precision. Regarding ML-Efficiency, ELD-VAE holds the best rank in Utility, while competing with LD-VAE in terms of ML-Fidelity.\\n\\n\\nIn sum, incorporating Transformers into different architecture components generally yields no substantial improvements for feature distribution modeling or machine-learning utility. The most notable effect appears in the high-density estimation metrics, where the baseline VAE and E-VAE synthesize data with higher fidelity, while models leveraging Transformers in the latent and decoder spaces produce more diverse samples. Section 5.2 delves deeper into this fidelity\\u2013diversity trade-off, and corresponding analyses for low-density estimation and ML-Efficiency are provided in the Supplemental Material.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.2 Fidelity-Diversity trade-off\\n\\nWe analyze changes in performance as Transformers are added to the network. Two sequences of models are considered to draw conclusions \\u2014 one that begins by appending a Transformer into the encoder, then to the latent space, and finally to the decoder. We dub this sequence Forward, which follows VAE \\u2192\\\\to E-VAE \\u2192\\\\to EL-VAE \\u2192\\\\to ELD-VAE; the second sequence begins by adding a Transformer to the decoder, then to the latent space, and finally to the encoder. We call this sequence Backward and follows VAE \\u2192\\\\to D-VAE \\u2192\\\\to LD-VAE \\u2192\\\\to ELD-VAE. Note that the models considered at the beginning and end of the sequences are the same. We continue to use Table\\u00a02, supported by Fig.\\u00a02, depicting differences in performance as Transformers are added to the network as a function of dataset size buckets, by considering buckets from small to large with the following intervals: small \\u2208\\\\in [500, 1000), medium \\u2208\\\\in [1000, 5000) and large \\u2208\\\\in [5000, 96230].\\n\\n\\nForward Sequence\\n\\nTable\\u00a02 reveals that, with the exception of E-VAE, adding Transformers into various components of the architecture generally results in synthetic data that is less faithful to real data. In the transition from E-VAE \\u2192\\\\to EL-VAE, it becomes clear that as the dataset size increases, the faithfulness of the synthetic data decreases (cf. top-right plot of Fig.\\u00a02) by considering a Transformer to leverage the latent representation of the architecture. Conversely, when transitioning from EL-VAE to ELD-VAE, the trend reverses: while EL-VAE faithfulness diminishes, particularly in larger datasets, its performance remains superior for small to mid-size datasets until ELD-VAE eventually overtakes it on larger ones.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: Aggregated gains in performance as Transformers are added to the studied components for \\u03b1\\\\alpha-Precision (top-plots) and \\u03b2\\\\beta-Recall (bottom-plots), for the Forward (left-plots) and Backward (right-plots) sequences.\\n\\n\\nRegarding \\u03b2\\\\beta-Recall, E-VAE performance remains approximately on par with that of the base VAE for all dataset buckets. On the other hand, an average gain of 4.7%4.7\\\\% is obtained when considering a Transformer over the latent space. In addition, we observe a consistent increase in diversity as the data bucket size increases. An additional benefit of 2.7% is achieved for applying a Transformer in the decoder (EL-VAE \\u2192\\\\to ELD-VAE). The bottom-left plot of Fig.\\u00a02 further indicates that these gains are more significant on small-size datasets while remaining approximately the same for medium and large dataset buckets.\\n\\n\\n\\nBackward Sequence\\n\\nIn the backward sequence, a considerable drop in performance of 6.7% in \\u03b1\\\\alpha-Precision is observed by considering a Transformer to leverage the reconstructed representation of the data (D-VAE). As shown in the top-right plot of Fig.\\u00a02, this decrease is consistent across all dataset sizes except for the larger ones, where a 2% improvement emerges. A gain in fidelity of 6% and 3.1% is observed for small and mid-size datasets when leveraging a Transformer over the latent space, while a significant loss of 4.8% is observed for large-size datasets. The transition from LD-VAE to ELD-VAE tells us that, for small datasets, leveraging the input representation with a Transformer deteriorates the faithfulness of the synthetic data, while for larger datasets, there is little to no gain. To conclude, in terms of \\u03b2\\\\beta-Recall, notable gains are observed from leveraging Transformers over the decoder (VAE \\u2192\\\\to D-VAE) and latent space (D-VAE \\u2192\\\\to LD-VAE).\\n\\n\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nThe evaluation presented in the previous section indicates a trade-off between high-density estimation metrics. In general, adding Transformers into a VAE posits a lower fidelity of the synthetic data w.r.t. the real one but a higher diversification. Comparing the base implementation of a VAE with the Transformed-based architectures, this trade-off is observed for all models except for E-VAE, which leverages the initial representation of the data at a lower level of abstraction (i.e., at the input level). We argue that E-VAE does not provide significant differences to its base implementation in terms of high-density estimation metrics since, after the model is trained, the encoder is \\u201cdetached\\\" from the model, and only the generator (decoder) is used to synthesize samples. In the Supplemental Material, an additional discussion of this trade-off is considered by evaluating the reconstructed data obtained by a forward pass on the test set.\\n\\n\\nAs deeper representations of the network are considered, self-attention has more flexibility in modeling feature interactions, as these representations are less constrained by the original representation of the data. From an evaluation perspective, we\\u2019ve shown in the previous section that this additional flexibility tends to produce more diverse and less faithful data. It is known that VAE produces less faithful (blurry) data\\u00a0[32] in the image modality due to the regularization term in the loss function that tries to approximate the distribution of the recognition model with the Gaussian prior.\\nHere, we observe that considering Transformers to leverage latent and reconstructed representations further impacts this faithfulness, albeit observing a considerable gain in diversity.\\n\\n\\nFrom a Machine-Learning standpoint, Table 2 shows that placing Transformers at various points in the network does not yield statistically significant gains. This outcome likely arises from spurious correlations introduced between the independent and dependent features, which, despite increasing diversity, do not translate into better decision-boundary estimation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"6 Representations Similarities\": \"\\n\\n6 Representations Similarities\\n\\nFigure 3: Aggregated similarities for the considered models for each data bucket.

We use Center Kernel Alignment (CKA), which provides a similarity measure via dot-product between feature representations while preserving orthogonal transformations and isotropic scaling \\u00a0[20].

This measure is bounded between [0,1], where 1 denotes that the considered representations are similar.\\n\\n\\nFigure 4: Similarities between block representations of a Transformer for the churn, adult and credit-approval datasets. Each cell of the heatmap denotes the similarity between two feature representations. Higher similarities have a lighter color. Depending on where a Transformer acts, we follow the naming convention T(Enc, Lat, Dec) to denote a given Transformer, while (in, out, block.i) to denote input, output, and internal block layer representations.\\n\\n\\nWe begin by considering similarities between the input and output representations of Transformers that are leveraged on the studied representations (cf. the Transformer architecture in Fig.\\u00a01). Note that these representations are a tensor \\ud835\\udc04\\u2208\\u211db\\u00d7F\\u00d7d\\\\mathbf{E}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{b\\\\times F\\\\times d}. In the following study, we flatten these representations into a matrix of shape \\ud835\\udc04\\u2208\\u211db\\u00d7F\\u200bd\\\\mathbf{E}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{b\\\\times Fd}. The CKA similarity is always evaluated over data points of the test set of a given dataset in a fully trained model.\\n\\n\\nAggregated Similarities\\n\\nWe begin by observing a high average similarity between representations before and after the encoder and decoder Transformers on all the considered networks, independently of the considered data bucket (cf. Fig.\\u00a03), hinting that, after a model is trained, and on average, little to no variation in the direction of these representations w.r.t. to its input are observed. Conversely, we observe a lower averaged similarity measure at the latent Transformer, likely due to the stochastic effects introduced by the reparameterization trick.\\n\\n\\nFigure 5: Heatmap similarities between representations on the considered Transformers for the ELD-VAE model, for the adult dataset. Each cell denotes the similarity between two feature representations inside a Transformer. The higher the similarity, the lighter the color of the cell. The Transformer on the left details the representations we extract to measure similarities presented in the heatmaps.\\n\\n\\n\\nInternal Similarities\\n\\nFollowing, we investigate the similarities between the input and output of each Transformer block of ELD-VAE on three different datasets. These similarities are presented in Fig.\\u00a04. We observe high similarities between consecutive Transformer block representations in each component. Notably, representations over the Transformer that act at the decoder present high similarity regardless of their depth, indicating little to no variation in the representation before and after its application, as previously discussed. Regarding Transformers that act at the input and latent representations, we observe a higher dissimilarity between the input and output representations, especially at the latent space, indicating representational changes in this region. We questioned whether this effect is due to possible over-parameterization of the network by considering different numbers of Transformer blocks in the considered components. We observed that even when one block is considered, a high similarity between representations is obtained. We explore this in more detail in the Supplemental Material.\\n\\n\\nAlso, representations between different Transformer components (e.g., from Latent to Decoder) tend to be highly dissimilar, possibly due to leveraging these representations by the following pointwise non-linearities operating in both the encoder and decoder.\\n\\n\\nWe further analyze how the internal representation similarities evolve within each Transformer block of the ELD-VAE architecture when applied to the adult dataset. Fig.\\u00a05 illustrates these changes, complemented with a Transformer block depicting the representations that are compared. It is noteworthy that although operations like layer normalization (e.n1) and self-attention (e.attn) initially exhibit lower similarity compared to the original representation (e.in), a significant increase in similarity is observed after applying the residual connection (e.res). While at the Transformers placed in the encoder and latent components, this effect is observed with a higher similarity inside each block; in the decoder, we observe this consecutively after each residual connection, across all blocks.\\n\\n\\nRecalling that the residual connection is the addition between the initial representation and the self-attention output, this suggests that the combination of layer normalization and self-attention does not alter the direction of the original representation. Instead, these components appear to function primarily as a scaling factor for the initial representation within each block. To validate this observation, we consider the residual connection expressed by E^=E+f\\u200b(E)\\\\hat{\\\\textbf{E}}=\\\\textbf{E}+f(\\\\textbf{E}), where E^\\\\hat{\\\\textbf{E}} corresponds to e.res, f\\u200b(E)f(\\\\textbf{E}) to e.attn, and E to e.in. If this residual connection merely scales the initial representation, then E^=\\u03c3\\u200bE\\\\hat{\\\\textbf{E}}=\\\\sigma\\\\textbf{E}. Analyzing this on a per-data-point basis, solving for \\u03c3\\\\sigma gives \\u03c3=E^\\u22c5EE\\u22c5E\\\\sigma=\\\\frac{\\\\hat{\\\\textbf{E}}\\\\cdot\\\\textbf{E}}{\\\\textbf{E}\\\\cdot\\\\textbf{E}}.\\n\\n\\nThe box-plots of Fig.\\u00a06 display the variation of \\u03c3\\\\sigma over the test set and across different blocks for ELD-VAE. At the decoder, the values of \\u03c3\\\\sigma are close to 1, indicating that the representations remain almost unchanged across the blocks. This suggests that once the model is trained, the Transformer at the decoder acts like an identity function. In the encoder, while the overall variability in representations is also low, different blocks yield distinct values of \\u03c3\\\\sigma. On the other hand, the latent representations exhibit a higher degree of variability in \\u03c3\\\\sigma, particularly noticeable in the first layer. To conclude this analysis, the bar-plots of Fig.\\u00a06 show that the norm of the representation after layer normalization is lower than that of the original representation, in particular at the decoder, indicating that this layer shifts and scales the initial representation s.t. it leads to negligible representation changes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 6: Top: \\u03c3\\\\sigma variation. Bottom: Norms of each representation inside each Transformer block. Both quantities are evaluated on the test set of adult dataset in the ELD-VAE architecture.\\n\\n\\n\", \"7 Conclusions\": \"\\n\\n7 Conclusions\\n\\nIn this study, we explored the effects of applying a Transformer to the input, latent, and reconstructed representations of a VAE. Our key takeaway is a trade-off between fidelity and diversity: while using Transformers on latent and reconstructed representations increases the variability of generated data, it also reduces its fidelity. Moreover, this heightened diversity does not bring noteworthy improvements in downstream Machine-Learning tasks, raising questions about the necessity of including Transformers, given their additional computational complexity.\\n\\n\\nWe further investigated the learned representations once these models were trained. A prominent observation is that the reconstructed representation processed by the Transformer essentially converges to the identity function. This behavior appears tied to residual connections, specifically because layer normalization rescales the input representation.\\n\\n\\nFuture research involves examining how incorporating Transformers affects the quality of synthetic data across other generative models. A parallel priority is tailoring Transformer architectures specifically for tabular data, which presents unique challenges compared to text-based domains. Finally, given the prominent re-scaling of layer normalization, a possible direction is to study the effect of removing this component of the Transformer architecture.\\n\\n\\n{ack}\\nThis work was partially funded by projects AISym4Med (101095387) supported by Horizon Europe Cluster 1: Health, ConnectedHealth (n.o 46858), supported by Competitiveness and Internationalisation Operational Programme (POCI) and Lisbon Regional Operational Programme (LISBOA 2020), under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement, through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and Center for Responsible AI, nr.

Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) addresses this challenge by enabling learning systems to continuously learn new classes while preserving prior knowledge. With the rise of pre-trained models (PTMs) such as CLIP, leveraging their strong generalization and semantic alignment capabilities has become a promising direction in CIL. However, existing CLIP-based CIL methods are often scattered across disparate codebases, rely on inconsistent configurations, hindering fair comparisons, reproducibility, and practical adoption. Therefore, we propose C3Box (CLIP-based Class-inCremental learning toolBOX), a modular and comprehensive Python toolbox. C3Box integrates representative traditional CIL methods, ViT-based CIL methods, and state-of-the-art CLIP-based CIL methods into a unified CLIP-based framework. By inheriting the streamlined design of PyCIL, C3Box provides a JSON-based configuration and standardized execution pipeline. This design enables reproducible experimentation with low engineering overhead and makes C3Box a reliable benchmark platform for continual learning research. Designed to be user-friendly, C3Box relies only on widely used open-source libraries and supports major operating systems.

However, real-world scenarios are inherently dynamic, with data typically emerging as continuous and evolving data streams\\u00a0(Gomes et al., 2017). Traditional deep learning methods are typically optimized for static data distributions and struggle to integrate new classes over time. When learning from dynamic data streams, these methods often overwrite previous knowledge to accommodate new classes, resulting in catastrophic forgetting\\u00a0(French, 1999). Class-Incremental Learning (CIL)\\u00a0(Rebuffi et al., 2017) has been proposed to address this issue\\u00a0(Zhou et al., 2024d). Driven by the remarkable success of Pre-trained Models (PTMs), such as Vision Transformers\\u00a0(Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) and CLIP\\u00a0(Radford et al., 2021), the focus of CIL research has undergone a significant shift. The field is moving away from traditional training from scratch with randomly initialized weights toward leveraging the inherent generalization capabilities of PTMs\\u00a0(Zhou et al., 2024b).\\n\\n\\nIn particular, CLIP\\u00a0(Radford et al., 2021) has emerged as a pioneering pre-trained vision-language model\\u00a0(Wang et al., 2024) that provides a powerful starting point for continual learning by aligning visual concepts with natural language in a shared embedding space. Unlike traditional vision-only models, CLIP leverages rich textual semantics to guide the learning process, offering a more robust representation that effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting while adapting to dynamic real-world scenarios\\u00a0(Hu et al., 2025; Wen et al., 2025). Despite these advantages, current CLIP-based CIL research still faces substantial practical challenges. Firstly, the implementation of various CLIP-based CIL methods is highly fragmented, with researchers often relying on disparate codebases and inconsistent experimental protocols. This lack of a unified framework makes it difficult to reproduce results and build upon previous work. Secondly, the absence of a standardized experimental protocol leads to significant evaluation inconsistency, where the use of varying data splits and evaluation metrics prevents fair comparisons. Thirdly, integrating CLIP-based methods into diverse incremental learning scenarios remains cumbersome, as different adaptation strategies often require bespoke modules and interface engineering, which imposes a significant engineering burden on researchers.\\n\\n\\nFigure 1:  Overview of C3Box and its main functionalities and modules.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo bridge these gaps and provide a standardized platform for the machine learning community, we present C3Box (CLIP-based Class-inCremental\\nlearning toolBOX), a modular and comprehensive toolbox specifically tailored.\\nAs shown in Figure\\u00a01, C3Box provides extensive algorithm coverage by integrating state-of-the-art CLIP-based CIL methods alongside representative traditional and ViT-based CIL approaches, as well as fundamental baselines, within a unified framework that enables systematic and fair baseline comparisons. Moreover, building on the streamlined architecture of PyCIL\\u00a0(Zhou et al., 2023a) and PILOT\\u00a0(Sun et al., 2025), C3Box provides a unified configuration and execution pipeline, allowing users to define datasets, backbones, and training settings in a single JSON file. This design offers a standardized interface that allows for seamless integration of new methods and automated logging, ensuring high reproducibility and minimal engineering overhead. As a user-friendly toolbox, C3Box adopts consistent unified interfaces across methods and relies only on widely used open-source libraries to ensure easy adoption and broad compatibility across major operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and Windows.\\n\\n\", \"2 Toolbox Usage\": \"\\n\\n2 Toolbox Usage\\n\\nDependencies: Building upon the established architectures of PyCIL\\u00a0(Zhou et al., 2023a) and PILOT\\u00a0(Sun et al., 2025), C3Box is built on a robust, modular software stack. It relies solely on a suite of widely adopted open-source libraries, such as NumPy\\u00a0(Harris et al., 2020) and SciPy\\u00a0(Virtanen et al., 2020) for fundamental numerical operations and optimization, while the core neural architectures are implemented using the PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019) framework. We also utilize the OpenCLIP library (Cherti et al., 2023) to provide a standardized interface for loading diverse pre-trained model weights.\\nThe tqdm\\u00a0(da Costa-Luis, 2019) library provides real-time progress monitoring.\\n\\n\\nSupported datasets: To thoroughly support the evaluation of various algorithms, we follow\\u00a0(Zhou et al., 2025c) and select ten benchmark datasets with significant domain gaps from CLIP\\u2019s pre-training dataset. The specific evaluation benchmarks include: CIFAR100 (Krizhevsky, 2009), CUB200 (Wah et al., 2011), ObjectNet (Barbu et al., 2019), ImageNet-R (Hendrycks et al., 2021), FGVCAircraft (Maji et al., 2013), StanfordCars (Krause et al., 2013), Food101 (Bossard et al., 2014), SUN397 (Xiao et al., 2010), UCF101 (Soomro et al., 2012) and TV100\\u00a0(Zhou et al., 2024a). Following the benchmark protocols in CIL\\u00a0(Zhou et al., 2025c), we evaluate on 100 classes for CIFAR100, Aircraft, Cars, Food, UCF and TV100; 200 classes for CUB200, ObjectNet, and ImageNet-R; and 300 classes for SUN to maintain consistency across incremental stages.\\n\\nDataset split: Following the evaluation protocols in CIL\\u00a0(Zhou et al., 2024d), we utilize \\u2018B-mm Inc-nn\\u2019 to split the classes. Specifically, mm denotes the number of classes in the initial stage, while nn represents the number of classes in each subsequent incremental stage.\\n\\nImplemented Methods:\\nC3Box implements a total of 17 representative CIL methods, covering traditional CIL methods, i.e., FOSTER\\u00a0(Wang et al., 2022a), MEMO\\u00a0(Zhou et al., 2023b), ViT-based CIL methods, i.e., L2P\\u00a0(Wang et al., 2022c), DualPrompt\\u00a0(Wang et al., 2022b), CODA-Prompt\\u00a0(Smith et al., 2023), EASE\\u00a0(Zhou et al., 2024c), SimpleCIL\\u00a0(Zhou et al., 2025a), APER (with Adapter/Finetune/SSF/VPT variants)\\u00a0(Zhou et al., 2025a), TUNA\\u00a0(Wang et al., 2025), and state-of-the-art CLIP-based methods, including RAPF\\u00a0(Huang et al., 2024),\\nCLG-CBM\\u00a0(Yu et al., 2025), MG-CLIP\\u00a0(Huang et al., 2025), PROOF\\u00a0(Zhou et al., 2025c), ENGINE\\u00a0(Zhou et al., 2025b), and BOFA\\u00a0(Li et al., 2026). In addition, C3Box provides common baselines such as Finetune and ZS-CLIP\\u00a0(Radford et al., 2021). Notably, all methods have been adapted into a unified CLIP-based framework. Implementation details are provided in Appendix\\u00a0A.\\n\\n\\nEvaluation metric: Following the evaluation protocols in CIL\\u00a0(Rebuffi et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2025c), we denote \\ud835\\udc9cb\\\\mathcal{A}_{b} as the model\\u2019s accuracy after the bb-th incremental stage. In C3Box, we employ main metrics to evaluate this implemented method: Last Accuracy \\ud835\\udc9cB\\\\mathcal{A}_{B}, which reflects performance after the last task, and Average Accuracy \\ud835\\udc9c\\u00af=1B\\u200b\\u2211b=1B\\ud835\\udc9cb\\\\bar{\\\\mathcal{A}}=\\\\frac{1}{B}\\\\sum_{b=1}^{B}\\\\mathcal{A}_{b}, which represents the mean accuracy across all incremental stages.

All experimental parameters, ranging from dataset specifications and model architectures to training protocols, are encapsulated in a single, human-readable JSON file. This centralized modular design eliminates the need for modifying underlying code; instead, users can simply adjust the global parameters or method-specific hyperparameters within the JSON file, and then run a standardized command:\\npython main.py --config=./exps/[MODEL_NAME].json\\nwhere [MODEL_NAME] corresponds to one of the implemented methods in C3Box, e.g., finetune, l2p, dual, engine, proof, clg_cbm, and bofa. The primary global parameters within this framework include:\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nbackbone-type: The pre-trained backbone weights used for model initialization. Our framework supports two commonly used pre-trained CLIP weight options, including LAION-400M\\u00a0(Ilharco et al., 2021) and OpenAI\\u00a0(Radford et al., 2021), for the CLIP with ViT-B/16 backbone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\ninit-cls: The number of classes in the initial stage. Our framework provides the flexibility to define various class numbers for the initial stage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nincrement: The number of classes added in each incremental stage ii, where i>1i>1. By default, our framework assumes that the number of classes remains constant across all subsequent incremental stages.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nmemory_per_class: The fixed number of exemplars is stored for each former class. For replay-based methods in C3Box, e.g., PROOF, MEMO, and FOSTER, following the setting in CIL\\u00a0(Zhou et al., 2025c), we use\\nthe herding\\u00a0(Welling, 2009) algorithm to select 20 exemplars per class for rehearsal.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nseed: The random seed adopted for shuffling the class order. Following\\u00a0(Rebuffi et al., 2017), we randomly shuffle the\\nclass order using a random seed of 1993 by default.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn addition to the above settings, global parameters, e.g., tuned_epoch, batch_size, optimization epoch, learning rate, weight_decay, init_lr, optimizer, and method-specific\\nhyperparameters, can be adjusted in the corresponding JSON file.\\n\\n\", \"3 Preliminary Experiments\": \"\\n\\n3 Preliminary Experiments\\n\\nFigure 2:  Reproduced incremental performance of different methods on Aircraft B0 Inc10.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a preliminary study for the machine learning community, we utilize a single NVIDIA 4090 GPU to evaluate the implemented methods on CIFAR100 B0\\nInc10 and Aircraft B0\\nInc10, using the LAION-400M pre-trained CLIP model.

However, in real-world scenarios, diverse stakeholders may demand differing fairness requirements over time, so retraining for different fairness requirements becomes prohibitive. To address this limitation, we propose Cofair, a single-train framework that enables post-training fairness control in recommendation. Specifically, Cofair introduces a shared representation layer with fairness-conditioned adapter modules to produce user embeddings specialized for varied fairness levels, along with a user-level regularization term that guarantees user-wise monotonic fairness improvements across these levels. We theoretically establish that the adversarial objective of Cofair upper bounds demographic parity and the regularization term enforces progressive fairness at user level. Comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets and backbone models demonstrate that our framework provides dynamic fairness at different levels, delivering comparable or better fairness-accuracy curves than state-of-the-art baselines, without the need to retrain for each new fairness requirement.

Introduction\\n\\nRecommender systems play a pivotal role in assisting users\\u2019 decision-making process across a broad range of domains, including e-commerce, social media, and entertainment platforms\\u00a0(Linden et al., 2003; Covington et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2025a; Guy et al., 2010).\\nWhile effective personalization can enhance user satisfaction and platform engagement, it also risks amplifying societal biases inherent in the data, disproportionately affecting particular groups of users based on sensitive attributes such as gender, race, or age\\u00a0(Li et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023).\\nTo this end, fairness-aware approaches have been explored by integrating fairness constraints into the training procedure, typically through learning fair representations of users that are independent of their sensitive attributes\\u00a0(Wu et al., 2022b; Madras et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2025a).\\nHowever, existing fairness approaches often fix fairness requirements at training time, forcing complete retraining whenever fairness needs evolve, which is a costly bottleneck in real-world deployments.\\n\\n\\n\\nRecently, some approaches have begun to address the inflexibility issue in fairness deployment post-training.\\nFor instance, Li et al.\\u00a0(Li et al., 2021b) present a personalized fairness approach that enables users to specify the sensitive attributes that would be independent of their recommendations. AFRL\\u00a0(Zhu et al., 2024) adaptively learns fair user representations by treating fairness requirements as inputs with information alignment, allowing users or system developers to select particular attributes to protect.\\nHowever, while these methods offer more flexibility in terms of selecting which attributes to protect, they have limited control over how much the fairness criteria (a.k.a. different fairness levels) to impose once training has finished, failing to support on-the-fly tuning of fairness degrees at inference time.\\nOn the other hand, though some studies\\u00a0(Song et al., 2019; Cui et al., 2023) provide theoretical fairness guarantees by allowing stakeholders to specify unfairness limits in training. Though their constrained optimization frameworks guarantee controllable fairness during training, they still lack post-training controllability as stakeholders must retrain the entire model to obtain outputs for different fairness levels, which is computationally prohibitive in real-world scenarios.\\n\\n\\nTo this end, we propose Cofair, a novel single-training approach that supports post-training fairness adjustments, thereby eliminating the need for repeated end-to-end retraining.\\nIn particular, it consists of a shared representation layer together with fairness-conditioned adapters to progressively optimize different fairness levels while enforcing monotonic improvements in fairness for each user.\\nThe shared representation layer is designed to capture user characteristics and common patterns essential for balancing accuracy and fairness across various settings, while the fairness-conditioned adapters aim to adjust user representations for specific fairness levels.\\nTo enforce progressive fairness constraints, we introduce a user-level regularization term to ensure that no individual user\\u2019s fairness degrades at higher fairness levels.\\nIn addition to its intuitive effectiveness in providing progressively fair performance across multiple levels, we formally guarantee this capability from a theoretical perspective by establishing two key statements.\\nFirst, we show that the adversarial fairness objective in Cofair upper bounds the group-fairness criterion of demographic parity in lemma, thereby suggesting that minimizing the adversarial fairness loss correlates with a reduction in group disparity. Moreover, our approach naturally accommodates extension to other fairness notions (e.g., equal opportunity) by tailoring the adversarial objective accordingly.\\nSecond, assisted by the prior lemma, Cofair further enforces non-decreasing fairness improvement for each user as the fairness level increases, guaranteed by the convergence of the user-level regularization.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn summary, the key contributions of this work are four-fold:\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nWe first propose a controllable fairness framework, Cofair, that supports adjustable fairness levels via adapter modules, offering post-training flexibility in real-world deployment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nWe propose a shared representation layer to capture common patterns for fairness-accuracy balances across levels and a set of fairness-conditioned adapters tailored to specific fairness levels, coupled with user-level regularization that enforces progressive fairness improvements.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nWe provide theoretical analysis establishing that our adversarial objective upper bounds group fairness criterion (e.g., demographic parity) and Cofair enforces monotonic fairness guarantees for each user.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nWe conduct extensive experiments against state-of-the-art fairness baselines and demonstrate that Cofair delivers controllable fairness at multiple levels with comparable or better fairness-accuracy curves, without retraining.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"2.

We denote the observed user-item interaction set with negative sample by \\ud835\\udc9f={(u,i,j)}\\\\mathcal{D}=\\\\{(u,i,j)\\\\}, where (u,i,j)\\u2208\\ud835\\udc9f(u,i,j)\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D} indicates a positive interaction (u,i)(u,i) such as a purchase or click, with a negative sample (u,j)(u,j) for pair-wise optimization.\\nThroughout, we assume that our model is based on user embeddings {\\ud835\\udc1eu}\\\\{\\\\mathbf{e}_{u}\\\\} derived from a base recommendation backbone such as BPR\\u00a0(Rendle et al., 2009) or LightGCN\\u00a0(He et al., 2020).\\nThe goal of a recommender system is to learn a scoring function y^u\\u200bi\\\\hat{y}_{ui} that ranks items for each user uu in descending order of predicted preference.\\nWe denote by \\u2112rec\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{rec}} the standard recommendation loss (e.g., BPR loss), which aims to maximize ranking performance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2.2. Fairness Task\\n\\nWe assume each user uu is associated with a binary sensitive attribute au\\u2208{0,1}a_{u}\\\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\}, such as genders male vs. female. For group-fairness metrics, we often separate users into two subgroups:\\n\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nG0={u\\u2223au=0},G1={u\\u2223au=1}.G_{0}=\\\\{u\\\\mid a_{u}=0\\\\},\\\\quad G_{1}=\\\\{u\\\\mid a_{u}=1\\\\}.\\n\\n\\n\\nOur approach can naturally extend to non-binary or intersectional attributes by employing multi-dimensional adversarial networks.\\n\\n\\nA central fairness notion in this paper is demographic parity (DP)\\u00a0(Dwork et al., 2012; Zemel et al., 2013), aiming to ensure that the model\\u2019s predictions are independent of sensitive attributes. Given a recommendation function G\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc1eu)G(\\\\mathbf{e}_{u}), the demographic parity difference \\u0394DP\\\\Delta_{\\\\text{DP}} is typically defined as:\\n\\n\\n(2)\\n\\n\\u0394DP=|\\ud835\\udd3cu\\u2208G1\\u200b[G\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc1eu)]\\u2212\\ud835\\udd3cu\\u2208G0\\u200b[G\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc1eu)]|.\\\\Delta_{\\\\text{DP}}=\\\\left|\\\\mathbb{E}_{u\\\\in G_{1}}[G(\\\\mathbf{e}_{u})]-\\\\mathbb{E}_{u\\\\in G_{0}}[G(\\\\mathbf{e}_{u})]\\\\right|.\\n\\n\\n\\nSmaller \\u0394DP\\\\Delta_{\\\\text{DP}} indicates reduced disparity across subgroups. In a top-KK recommendation context, DP can also be measured by\\ncomparing the recommendation lists distributed equally across groups\\u00a0(Zhao et al., 2023a).\\nAlthough our focus is on DP for concreteness, the proposed framework is flexible enough to accommodate other fairness notions, such as Equal Opportunity\\u00a0(Hardt et al., 2016), as discussed in Section\\u00a04.3.\\n\\n\\nTo integrate fairness, we introduce a fairness loss \\u2112fair\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{fair}} typically enforced via an adversarial network. In Section\\u00a03, we explain how we partition these components across multiple fairness levels and apply user-level regularization to maintain progressive constraints.\\n\\n\\n\", \"3. Methodology\": \"\\n\\n3. Methodology\\n\\nIn this section, we present our controllable fairness framework, which allows the recommender system to produce a range of fairness-accuracy trade-offs after a single training cycle. The key idea is to introduce a shared user representation combined with fairness-conditioned adapter modules, each targeting a different fairness level.\\nWe then describe our user-level regularization, ensuring progressive fairness for each user across levels.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1. Model Architecture\\n\\nLet \\ud835\\udc1eu\\u2208\\u211dd\\\\mathbf{e}_{u}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d} be the original embedding of user uu, derived from a standard baseline model (e.g., BPR or LightGCN). We aim to transform \\ud835\\udc1eu\\\\mathbf{e}_{u} into multiple embeddings \\ud835\\udc1eu(t)\\\\mathbf{e}_{u}^{(t)}, each calibrated to a different fairness level t\\u2208{1,\\u2026,T}t\\\\in\\\\{1,\\\\dots,T\\\\}. To do so, we define three components:\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1.1. Shared Representation Layer\\n\\nTo efficiently capture user characteristics that are common across different fairness requirements while avoiding redundant learning, we introduce a shared representation layer that serves as the foundation for all fairness levels. This design follows the principle of multi-task learning\\u00a0(Caruana, 1997; Wang et al., 2021), where shared knowledge can benefit multiple related tasks\\u2014in our case, recommendation under different fairness constraints.\\n\\n\\nWe map the original embedding \\ud835\\udc1eu\\\\mathbf{e}_{u} into a lower-dimensional shared embedding \\ud835\\udc2cu\\u2208\\u211dds\\\\mathbf{s}_{u}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d_{s}}:\\n\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc2cu=S\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc1eu;\\u03b8s),\\\\mathbf{s}_{u}=S(\\\\mathbf{e}_{u};\\\\theta_{s}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere SS is a neural network with parameters \\u03b8s\\\\theta_{s}.\\nThis shared architecture\\nacts as an efficient dimension reduction mechanism\\u00a0(Kusupati et al., 2022) that distills essential user characteristics common across different fairness levels.\\nBy maintaining a single shared layer, it provides a stable foundation for learning fairness-invariant features, making the model more robust to fairness adjustments.\\nWhat\\u2019s more, this design also reduces the model\\u2019s memory footprint while maintaining its expressive power, as common patterns need only be learned once rather than separately for each fairness level.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1.2. Fairness-Conditioned Adapters\\n\\nDifferent stakeholders may require varying degrees of fairness in recommendations, from minimal intervention to strict equality across groups.\\nTo accommodate this spectrum of requirements without compromising the shared user characteristics, we employ specialized adapter modules for each fairness level.\\nSpecifically, for each fairness level tt, we define an adapter network P(t)P^{(t)}, producing an adapter embedding \\ud835\\udc29u(t)\\u2208\\u211ddp\\\\mathbf{p}_{u}^{(t)}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d_{p}}:\\n\\n\\n(4)\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc29u(t)=P(t)\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc1eu;\\u03b8p(t)).\\\\mathbf{p}_{u}^{(t)}=P^{(t)}\\\\bigl(\\\\mathbf{e}_{u};\\\\theta_{p}^{(t)}\\\\bigr).\\n\\n\\n\\nBy employing parallel adapters, the framework can dynamically switch to any desired fairness regime after aligning with the shared representation. This modular architecture not only preserves the core user characteristic (learned in the shared layer) but also limits fairness-specific alterations to each adapter. Consequently, each adapter learns its own \\u201cknob\\u201d to dial in the level of debiasing, thus offering a flexible pathway for controlling fairness across a broad range of user protection requirements.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1.3. Output Layer\\n\\nThe final user embedding \\ud835\\udc1eu(t)\\\\mathbf{e}_{u}^{(t)} is obtained by concatenating the shared embedding \\ud835\\udc2cu\\\\mathbf{s}_{u} and the adapter embedding \\ud835\\udc29u(t)\\\\mathbf{p}_{u}^{(t)}, followed by an output transformation O\\u200b(\\u22c5)O(\\\\cdot):\\n\\n\\n(5)\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc1eu(t)=O\\u200b([\\ud835\\udc2cu;\\ud835\\udc29u(t)];\\u03b8o).\\\\mathbf{e}_{u}^{(t)}=O\\\\Bigl(\\\\bigl[\\\\mathbf{s}_{u};\\\\mathbf{p}_{u}^{(t)}\\\\bigr];\\\\theta_{o}\\\\Bigr).\\n\\n\\n\\nHere, \\u03b8o\\\\theta_{o} are the parameters of the output layer, and [\\u22c5;\\u22c5][\\\\cdot;\\\\cdot] indicates concatenation. As discussed, we keep the shared portion \\ud835\\udc2cu\\\\mathbf{s}_{u} to minimize redundancy, while P(t)P^{(t)} injects fairness-specific adjustments.\\n\\n\\nNotably, Cofair is a model-agnostic framework, compatible with various recommendation backbones such as BPR and LightGCN.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2. Loss Functions\\n\\nOur framework comprises three key losses: (1) a standard recommendation loss, (2) an adversarial fairness loss, and (3) a user-level regularization term.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2.1. Recommendation Loss\\n\\nDenote by y^u\\u200bi(t)\\\\hat{y}_{ui}^{(t)} the predicted score for user uu and item ii at fairness level tt, derived from \\ud835\\udc1eu(t)\\\\mathbf{e}_{u}^{(t)}. We employ the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss\\u00a0(Rendle et al., 2009):\\n\\n\\n(6)\\n\\n\\u2112rec(t)=\\u2212\\u2211(u,i,j)\\u2208\\ud835\\udc9fln\\u2061\\u03c3\\u200b(y^u\\u200bi(t)\\u2212y^u\\u200bj(t)),\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{rec}}^{(t)}=-\\\\sum_{(u,i,j)\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}}\\\\ln\\\\sigma\\\\bigl(\\\\hat{y}_{ui}^{(t)}-\\\\hat{y}_{uj}^{(t)}\\\\bigr),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u03c3\\u200b(\\u22c5)\\\\sigma(\\\\cdot) is the sigmoid function. Our method can be similarly integrated with other recommendation backbones (e.g., LightGCN\\u00a0(He et al., 2020)).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2.2. Fairness Loss via Adversarial Network\\n\\nTo mitigate differences in embeddings for users with different sensitive attributes, we adopt an adversarial network D\\u200b(\\u22c5;\\u03b8d)D(\\\\cdot;\\\\theta_{d})\\u00a0(Goodfellow et al., 2014; Bose and Hamilton, 2019) that predicts aua_{u} from \\ud835\\udc1eu(t)\\\\mathbf{e}_{u}^{(t)}. Let au\\u2208{0,1}a_{u}\\\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\} be the binary attribute for user uu. We define:\\n\\n\\n(7)\\n\\n\\u2112fair(t)=\\u2212\\u2211u\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb0\\u2113BCE\\u200b(D\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc1eu(t);\\u03b8d),au).\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{fair}}^{(t)}=-\\\\sum_{u\\\\in\\\\mathcal{U}}\\\\ell_{\\\\text{BCE}}\\\\bigl(D(\\\\mathbf{e}_{u}^{(t)};\\\\theta_{d}),\\\\,a_{u}\\\\bigr).\\n\\n\\n\\nHere, \\u2113BCE\\\\ell_{\\\\text{BCE}} denotes the binary cross-entropy loss. By maximizing this term with respect to \\u03b8d\\\\theta_{d} and minimizing it with respect to (\\u03b8s,\\u03b8p(t),\\u03b8o)(\\\\theta_{s},\\\\theta_{p}^{(t)},\\\\theta_{o}), we enforce an embedding space where DD cannot readily discern the sensitive attribute, as a proxy for demographic parity. In Section\\u00a04.1, we show that minimizing this adversarial loss tightly relates to reducing the demographic parity difference \\u0394DP\\\\Delta_{\\\\text{DP}}.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2.3. User-Level Regularization\\n\\nOur goal is to ensure progressive fairness, wherein each user\\u2019s fairness strictly improves (or remains the same) as the fairness level tt increases.\\nRelying solely on group-level metrics could overlook instances where certain individuals become worse off.\\nHence, we impose a penalty if any user\\u2019s fairness degrades with a stricter requirement.\\nTo formalize this, we define a per-user fairness loss:\\n\\n\\n\\n(8)\\n\\n\\u2112fair(t)\\u200b(u)=\\u2212\\u2113BCE\\u200b(D\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc1eu(t);\\u03b8d),au).\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{fair}}^{(t)}(u)=-\\\\ell_{\\\\text{BCE}}\\\\bigl(D(\\\\mathbf{e}_{u}^{(t)};\\\\theta_{d}),\\\\,a_{u}\\\\bigr).\\n\\n\\n\\nWe then incorporate a user-level regularizer to penalize scenarios where fairness at level t+1t+1 is worse than at level tt:\\n\\n\\n(9)\\n\\n\\u2112reg=\\u2211u\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb0\\u2211t=1T\\u22121softplus\\u200b(\\u2112fair(t+1)\\u200b(u)\\u2212\\u2112fair(t)\\u200b(u)).\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{reg}}=\\\\sum_{u\\\\in\\\\mathcal{U}}\\\\sum_{t=1}^{T-1}\\\\text{softplus}\\\\Bigl(\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{fair}}^{(t+1)}(u)-\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{fair}}^{(t)}(u)\\\\Bigr).\\n\\n\\n\\nMinimizing this term enforces that each user\\u2019s fairness loss does not increase when moving to a stricter fairness level.\\nThe user-level regularization serves as a critical component for ensuring fairness consistency at the individual user level, penalizing any degradation in per-user fairness as the fairness level increases.\\nThis guarantees that stricter fairness levels provide monotonically improving fairness for each user, not just on average, leading to more equitable and stable recommendations across the user base.\\nAdditionally, this regularization may help prevent fairness oscillations during training, promoting smoother convergence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3. Adaptive Weighting of the Fairness Loss\\n\\nWhile each level tt has a fairness loss \\u2112fair(t)\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{fair}}^{(t)}, we introduce a single scalar \\u03bbt\\\\lambda_{t} that balances fairness vs. recommendation in the overall training objective.\\nA naive approach would arbitrarily fix \\u03bbt\\\\lambda_{t} or define them manually for each tt.\\nHowever, simply fixing different fairness coefficients for each level manually (i.e., a naive approach) does not scale well when TT (the number of fairness levels) is large.\\nTuning each coefficient by hand would require intensive hyperparameter search for every new requirement, and it is not trivial to guarantee the desired degree of fairness improvement from level to level.\\nIn contrast, we introduce an adaptive weighting mechanism to dynamically adjust each fairness coefficient \\u03bbt\\\\lambda_{t} based on the current progress of the model training:\\n\\n\\n(10)\\n\\n\\u03bbt+1=\\u03bbt+\\u03b7\\u200b[\\u20091\\u2212\\u2112fair(t)\\u2212\\u2112fair(t+1)\\u2112fair(t)],\\\\lambda_{t+1}=\\\\lambda_{t}\\\\;+\\\\;\\\\eta\\\\;\\\\Bigl[\\\\,1-\\\\frac{\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{fair}}^{(t)}-\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{fair}}^{(t+1)}}{\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{fair}}^{(t)}}\\\\Bigr],\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u03b7\\\\eta is a small learning rate for the fairness coefficients. Intuitively, if the fairness loss at level t+1t+1 is not sufficiently improved over level tt, then \\u03bbt+1\\\\lambda_{t+1} is decreased, making fairness more critical in the subsequent training updates.\\nThis adaptive weighting mechanism reduces manual effort and ensures a smooth fairness-accuracy trade-off across various levels.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4. Overall Objective\\n\\nCombining all components, we minimize with respect to \\u0398={\\u03b8s,{\\u03b8p(t)}t=1T,\\u03b8o}\\\\Theta=\\\\{\\\\theta_{s},\\\\{\\\\theta_{p}^{(t)}\\\\}_{t=1}^{T},\\\\theta_{o}\\\\} and maximize with respect to \\u03b8d\\\\theta_{d}:\\n\\n\\n(11)\\n\\nmin\\u0398\\u2061max\\u03b8d\\u2061{\\u2112=1T\\u200b\\u2211t=1T[\\u2112rec(t)+\\u03bbt\\u200b\\u2112fair(t)]+\\u03b2\\u200b\\u2112reg},\\\\min_{\\\\Theta}\\\\max_{\\\\theta_{d}}\\\\Bigl\\\\{\\\\mathcal{L}=\\\\frac{1}{T}{}\\\\sum_{t=1}^{T}\\\\Bigl[\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{rec}}^{(t)}+\\\\lambda_{t}\\\\,\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{fair}}^{(t)}\\\\Bigr]\\\\;+\\\\;\\\\beta\\\\,\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{reg}}\\\\Bigr\\\\},\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u03b2\\\\beta is a hyperparameter to control the strength of the user-level regularization.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.5. Training Procedure and Implementation\\n\\nWe alternate between updating the adversarial network DD to better predict aua_{u}, and updating the shared and adapter networks to fool DD. We also periodically update \\u03bbt\\\\lambda_{t} via Eq.\\u00a0(10) and back-propagate through the user-level regularization Eq.\\u00a0(9).\\n\\n\\nIn each training epoch, Cofair processes user embeddings through TT parallel adapter modules, incurring TT forward passes per epoch. However, this does not substantially inflate overall runtime, as the shared representation layer is computed once and each adapter network is typically lightweight (single-layer MLP in our experiments).\\nAt inference time, we feed \\ud835\\udc1eu\\\\mathbf{e}_{u} into one of the TT adapter modules, selecting the desired fairness level.\\nSince all TT fairness levels are learned simultaneously, Cofair only needs to train once, thereby eliminating the multiple full retraining runs required by other methods. This design leads to a practical and scalable solution, as also demonstrated by the efficiency measurements in Section\\u00a05.6.\\n\\n\\n\", \"4. Theoretical Analysis\": \"\\n\\n4.

Extension to Other Fairness Criteria\\n\\nWhile our main theoretical focus is on demographic parity, the framework is general. For instance, Equal Opportunity (EOpp) demands that true positive rates (TPRs) be equal across groups\\u00a0(Hardt et al., 2016). We can adapt our adversarial term to incorporate labels of user relevance (or positive feedback) when training DD so that it specifically penalizes differences conditional on y=1y=1. Formally, one may replace \\u2113BCE\\\\ell_{\\\\text{BCE}} in Eq.\\u00a0(7) with a specialized loss that predicts aua_{u} only among users with yu=1y_{u}=1, or incorporate a step that conditions on positive interactions. The user-level regularization in Eq.\\u00a0(9) similarly ensures each user\\u2019s fairness with respect to EOpp does not degrade at higher tt. Our theoretical bounding arguments extend under standard assumptions that the new fairness loss upper-bounds the chosen fairness metric\\u00a0(Madras et al., 2018). Hence, although we focus on DP for clarity, the proposed \\u201ccontrol on the fly\\u201d strategy naturally accommodates a range of fairness definitions.\\n\\n\\nWhile our theoretical analysis assumes the existence of an optimal adversary, in practice, the empirical performance may be influenced by the training dynamics of min-max optimization and the choice of hyperparameters \\u03b2\\\\beta and \\u03b7\\\\eta.\\n\\n\\n\", \"5.

Experimental Setup\\n\\n\\n5.1.1. Datasets\\n\\nExperiments were conducted on two public datasets:\\nMovielens-1M\\u00a0(Harper and Konstan, 2015) is a classic movie-rating dataset with dense user-item interactions. We treat any rating above 0 as a positive interaction, following\\u00a0(Zhao et al., 2023a; Islam et al., 2021).\\nLastfm-360K\\u00a0(Celma Herrada and others, 2009) is a large music recommendation dataset with play records of users from Last.FM. We performed 20-core filtering and sampled a subset following\\u00a0(Zhao et al., 2023a).\\n\\n\\nWe treat gender as sensitive attribute, which is the most widely considered sensitive attribute in the fairness literature\\u00a0(Wang et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Deldjoo et al., 2024).\\nThe statistics of the processed datasets are shown in Table\\u00a01.\\n\\n\\nTable 1.

Evaluation Protocols\\n\\nWe evaluate recommendation accuracy with two widely adopted ranking metrics Recall@10\\u00a0(Gunawardana and Shani, 2009) and NDCG@10\\u00a0(J\\u00e4rvelin and Kek\\u00e4l\\u00e4inen, 2017). Larger values indicate better recommendation accuracy. We evaluate fairness performance with two widely used group fairness metrics in recommender systems, DP@10\\u00a0(Zhao et al., 2023a) and EOpp@10\\u00a0(Zhao et al., 2023a), where DP@10 measures if the items in the Top-10 recommendations are distributed equally across user groups and EOpp@10 measures if relevant items in the Top-10 recommendations are distributed equally across groups. Lower values indicate better fairness performance. We validate our findings by calculating pp-values to assess statistical significance against the best baseline.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.1.3. Base Models\\n\\nFollowing previous research\\u00a0(Zhao et al., 2023b, 2024, 2025b), we evaluate fairness methods on two representative recommender backbones:\\nBPR\\u00a0(Rendle et al., 2009) that learns user and item embeddings by maximizing pairwise rankings, and LightGCN\\u00a0(He et al., 2020) that is a graph-based collaborative filtering framework to refine embeddings via message passing over user-item bipartite graphs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.1.4. Baselines\\n\\nWe compare our method against the following fairness baselines: ComFair\\u00a0(Bose and Hamilton, 2019) applies compositional adversarial learning to eliminate sensitive multi-attribute information in user representations via a min-max game. FairRec\\u00a0(Wu et al., 2021a) decomposes adversarial learning to generate a bias-free user representation with minimized sensitive information and a bias-aware user representation with maximized sensitive information, aiming to obscure sensitive information in recommendation. FairGo\\u00a0(Wu et al., 2021b) applies compositional filters to both user and item representations, and applies discriminators to explicit user representation and graph-based high-order user representation. AFRL\\u00a0(Zhu et al., 2024) adaptively learns fair representations by treating fairness requirements as inputs, preserves non-sensitive information, and incorporates debiased embeddings to balance fairness and accuracy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.1.5. Implementation Details\\n\\nFor a fair comparison, all methods are in the same optimization setting: the latent space dimension of 64, the Adam optimizer\\u00a0(Kingma and Ba, 2015) with learning rate of 0.001, batch size of 4096, the 1:1 negative sampling strategy\\u00a0(Wei et al., 2021), and Xavier initialization\\u00a0(Glorot and Bengio, 2010).\\nThe dimensions dsd_{s} and dpd_{p} are both 64, matching the latent dimension dd.\\nThe hyperparameters \\u03bb0\\\\lambda_{0}, \\u03b7\\\\eta, and \\u03b2\\\\beta are tuned within the range of (0,1](0,1], based on performance on a validation set.\\nThe shared representation layer SS, the adapter modules P(t)P^{(t)}, and the output layer are each implemented as a single-layer feedforward neural network (i.e., 1-layer MLP).\\nThe adversarial network DD is implemented using a 2-layer MLP with LeakyReLU activation\\u00a0(Maas et al., 2013) and a dropout rate of 0.2.\\nWe set T=5T=5 to evaluate fairness-accuracy trade-offs at 5 different fairness levels.\\nFor baselines, we adopt the hyperparameter settings recommended by authors or provided in public implementations or fine-tune them for best performance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.2. Overall Performance (RQ1)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) Movielens-1M\\n(BPR as backbone)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) Movielens-1M\\n(LightGCN as backbone)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(c) Lastfm-360K\\n(BPR as backbone)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(d) Lastfm-360K\\n(LightGCN as backbone)\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 1. Fairness-accuracy curves, where points closer to the left (indicating greater fairness) and the top (indicating higher accuracy), are more Pareto efficient. Notably, the results for baselines are obtained after multiple training, while the results for our Cofair are obtained after single training and multiple forward pass by indicating different values of tt.\\n\\n\\nFigure\\u00a01 illustrates the fairness-accuracy performance of our proposed Cofair method compared to four baselines on two benchmark datasets, MovieLens-1M and Lastfm-360K, each examined with two different recommendation backbones (BPR and LightGCN).\\nPoints in curves that are closer to the left (greater fairness) and higher on the y-axis (stronger accuracy) are generally considered more Pareto-efficient. Note that all baseline curves are obtained by training the models multiple times under different hyperparameter configurations for each fairness level, whereas Cofair generates the entire curve in a single training pass, with multiple inference phases (varying tt).\\nBelow are three key observations:\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nCofair achieves the most Pareto-efficient trade-offs between fairness and accuracy in 15 out of 16 total comparisons.\\nThese improvements over the best baseline(s) are validated to be significant using a two-sided t-test with p<0.05p<0.05.\\nThe sole exception is Recall vs. DP with BPR on MovieLens-1M, where Cofair ranks second but remains competitively close to the best-performing method. This overall dominance suggests Cofair effectively balances fairness constraints and recommendation quality across multiple levels without retraining.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nCofair typically spans a wider range of fairness values (DP@10 and EOpp@10) in a single training run than baselines, which must be retrained multiple times to produce similar curves. Notably, under certain configurations (e.g., LightGCN on Lastfm-360K), some baselines may match or slightly surpass Cofair in the range of attainable fairness. Nevertheless, in most scenarios, Cofair exhibits greater flexibility to navigate trade-offs between extreme fairness and high accuracy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nWhile the fairness range of Cofair under the LightGCN backbone on Lastfm-360K is somewhat less extensive than in other settings, it consistently achieves the best DP@10 or EOpp@10 measure at each fairness level with minimal accuracy loss. We conjecture that this is partly due to the inherent adaptability of LightGCN\\u2019s embeddings, which enables Cofair to enforce fairness constraints more uniformly across users. Consequently, Cofair attains highly competitive fairness-accuracy trade-offs in this case.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn conclusion, these results demonstrate that Cofair offers strong and flexible fairness-accuracy trade-offs across different datasets, backbones, and fairness requirements, without the need for repeated retraining. The framework thus emerges as an effective, efficient, and flexible route to incorporate fairness constraints in recommender systems while maintaining robust performance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.3.

This improvement comes at the cost of a moderate 3.70% decrease in NDCG@10, which aligns with our design goal of enforcing stronger fairness constraints.\\n\\n\\nWe further analyze the contribution of each component. Removing the shared representation layer (\\u201cw/o SRL\\u201d) leads to a notable decrease in fairness, indicating its role in capturing common patterns. The fairness-conditioned adapters (FCA) are critical for controllability; without them (\\u201cw/o FCA\\u201d), the performance collapses to a single regime with identical results across all tt. Similarly, removing the adaptive weighting loss (\\u201cw/o AWL\\u201d) results in static fairness coefficients that fail to show clear progression as tt increases. Finally, the user-level regularization (\\u201cw/o URL\\u201d) is essential for user-level consistency; its absence weakens the fairness improvement at higher levels, confirming the effectiveness of enforcing per-user constraints.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.4. Hyperparameter Analysis (RQ3)\\n\\nWe investigate the effects of hyperparameters \\u03bb0\\\\lambda_{0}, \\u03b7\\\\eta, and \\u03b2\\\\beta on the mean (\\u03bc\\\\mu) and variance (\\u03c32\\\\sigma^{2}) of performance across fairness levels, as shown in Figure\\u00a02. For the initial fairness coefficient \\u03bb0\\\\lambda_{0}, increasing it leads to improved average fairness (lower \\u03bcD\\u200bP\\\\mu_{DP}) but diminished differentiation across levels (lower \\u03c3D\\u200bP2\\\\sigma^{2}_{DP}). Since larger \\u03bb0\\\\lambda_{0} also results in higher accuracy instability (higher \\u03c3N\\u200bD\\u200bC\\u200bG2\\\\sigma^{2}_{NDCG}), a smaller \\u03bb0\\\\lambda_{0} is preferred to balance fairness differentiation with stable accuracy.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2. Means and variances of DP (\\u03bcD\\u200bP\\\\mu_{DP} and \\u03c3D\\u200bP2\\\\sigma^{2}_{DP}) and NDCG (\\u03bcN\\u200bD\\u200bC\\u200bG\\\\mu_{NDCG} and \\u03c3N\\u200bD\\u200bC\\u200bG2\\\\sigma^{2}_{NDCG}) on BPR backbone and Movielens-1M dataset with different values of \\u03bb0\\\\lambda_{0}, \\u03b7\\\\eta, and \\u03b2\\\\beta, respectively.\\n\\n\\nRegarding the update rate \\u03b7\\\\eta, larger values facilitate stronger fairness and distinct differentiation (higher \\u03c3D\\u200bP2\\\\sigma^{2}_{DP}) but at the cost of reduced accuracy, suggesting a moderate \\u03b7\\\\eta yields the optimal trade-off. Similarly, increasing the user-level regularization weight \\u03b2\\\\beta improves fairness parallel to \\u03b7\\\\eta. However, its impact on accuracy is less strictly monotonic, implying that a medium \\u03b2\\\\beta can effectively enhance user-level fairness constraints without ensuring a significant drop in average recommendation performance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.5. Framework Study (RQ4)\\n\\nFigure 3. Comparison of four fairness methods without and with our controllable fairness framework (indicated by \\u201c+ Cofair\\u201d), using BPR as backbone on MovieLens-1M.\\n\\n\\nWe validate the generality of Cofair by integrating it with four representative methods: ComFair, FairRec, FairGo, and AFRL. Figure\\u00a03 compares the original methods (which require retraining for each point) against their Cofair-augmented versions (\\u201c+ Cofair\\u201d). We highlight two key observations. Firstly, unlike the baselines that necessitate repeated retraining, the augmented methods achieve dynamic fairness control in a single run. By simply adjusting tt during inference, Cofair spans a broader range of fairness values, enabling fine-grained control based on real-time needs. Secondly, the augmented methods consistently maintain or surpass the Pareto efficiency of the original baselines. Notably, they often achieve superior fairness metrics (lower DP@10 or EOpp@10) while preserving competitive accuracy (NDCG). This confirms that Cofair serves as an effective, plug-and-play framework to inject flexibility into existing models without performance degradation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.6.

Nevertheless, this reduced epoch requirement leads to substantial overall time savings, demonstrating that Cofair can efficiently generate multiple fairness configurations within a single training cycle. These findings highlight Cofair\\u2019s scalability to large recommender systems, where repeated retraining to explore multiple fairness-accuracy trade-offs would be computationally prohibitive.\\n\\n\\n\", \"6.

Group fairness primarily addresses equity among user groups with different sensitive attributes in terms of recommendation distribution or performance metrics\\u00a0(Li et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023). Notably, demographic parity\\u00a0(Kamishima et al., 2011), which promotes similar treatment across groups in both rating-based\\u00a0(Kamishima et al., 2011) and ranking-based\\u00a0(Wu et al., 2021b) scenarios.\\nEqual opportunity\\u00a0(Hardt et al., 2016) considers true user preferences in addition, with corresponding metrics for rating-based\\u00a0(Yao and Huang, 2017) and ranking-based\\u00a0(Zhao et al., 2023a) systems.\\nTo achieve group fairness, researchers have developed various approaches, including regularization-based methods\\u00a0(Yao and Huang, 2017; Togashi et al., 2024; Shao et al., 2024), adversarial learning techniques\\u00a0(Bose and Hamilton, 2019; Li et al., 2021b; Yang et al., 2024), and re-ranking strategies\\u00a0(Li et al., 2021a; Xu et al., 2023).\\nFor instance, FOCF\\u00a0(Yao and Huang, 2017) directly optimizes fairness metrics through regularization, while ComFair\\u00a0(Bose and Hamilton, 2019) employs adversarial networks to eliminate sensitive information from user representations.\\nUGF\\u00a0(Li et al., 2021a) addresses user unfairness through integer programming-based re-ranking.\\nHowever, these approaches generally lack post-training flexibility, requiring complete model retraining to accommodate different fairness requirements.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6.2. Controllable Fairness\\n\\nRecent advances in controllable fairness have pursued two main directions. The first focuses on attribute-level control, allowing stakeholders to select which sensitive attributes to protect after training. Li et al.\\u00a0(Li et al., 2021b) pioneered personalized fairness by enabling users to specify which sensitive attributes should be independent of their recommendations. AFRL\\u00a0(Zhu et al., 2024) extended this concept through information alignment, treating fairness requirements as inputs for adaptive fair representation learning. However, these approaches offer limited control over the magnitude of fairness enforcement during inference.\\nThe second direction emphasizes theoretical guarantees through constrained optimization. Several works\\u00a0(Song et al., 2019; Cui et al., 2023; Gupta et al., 2021) achieve controllable fairness by allowing stakeholders to specify unfairness limits prior to training. For example,\\u00a0(Song et al., 2019) derives tractable bounds connecting to specified fairness constraints for controllable optimization, while\\u00a0(Cui et al., 2023) enables both unfairness limit specification during training and demographic group selection post-training. While these approaches provide theoretical guarantees through constrained optimization, their controllability remains confined to the training phase, necessitating model retraining to achieve different fairness levels in practice.\\n\\n\\n\", \"7. Conclusion\": \"\\n\\n7. Conclusion\\n\\nIn this paper, we addressed the critical challenge of post-training fairness inflexibility in recommender systems by introducing Cofair, a single-train framework enabling dynamic fairness adjustments after training. Our approach eliminates the need for repeated full retraining whenever stakeholders adjust fairness requirements. The framework\\u2019s architecture combines a shared representation layer with fairness-conditioned adapters, effectively capturing both universal user characteristics and fairness-specific patterns across different fairness levels. The shared representation layer establishes a foundation for balancing accuracy and fairness across various settings, while the fairness-conditioned adapters fine-tune user representations according to specific fairness requirements. To ensure monotonic fairness enforcements, we implemented a user-level regularization loss that prevents fairness degradation for individual users as fairness levels increase. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Cofair\\u2019s adversarial fairness objective provides an upper bound for the fairness criterion (e.g., demographic parity), while the user-level regularization ensures monotonic enhancement of fairness metrics. Through comprehensive experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art baselines, we validated that Cofair achieves controllable fairness across multiple levels while maintaining competitive fairness-accuracy trade-offs, all without the computational burden of model retraining.\\n\\n\\nFuture research directions could explore the integration of multiple fairness definitions into a unified framework\\u00a0(Wu et al., 2022a; Wang et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2021c). While our current approach can be adapted to different fairness notions, developing a structured framework that explicitly leverages the relationships among various fairness definitions remains challenging.\\n\\n\\nAcknowledgements.This work is supported by Hong Kong Baptist University Key Research Partnership Scheme (KRPS/23-24/02) and NSFC/RGC Joint Research Scheme (N_HKBU214/24).\\n\\n\\n\\n\"}, \"bibliography\": {\"A.

This metric could become a standard benchmark in model evaluation, especially in high-stakes applications like scientific discovery, drug design, and content generation, where diversity is critical for innovation and robustness. Moreover, by grounding diversity in information-theoretic principles (von Neumann entropy), the proposed metric would offer deeper theoretical insight into what \"diversity\" truly means in complex data spaces, potentially guiding the design of more diverse and generalizable AI systems.\n\n---\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in balancing three conflicting requirements: **generality**, **scalability**, and **interpretability**. Existing reference-free metrics (like the Vendi Score) rely on computing the full similarity matrix and its eigenvalues, which scales quadratically with data size\u2014making them infeasible for large-scale datasets. Naive approximations (e.g., random sampling or sketching) risk losing critical information about global structure. Additionally, interpreting the resulting diversity score as an \"effective number of distinct elements\" requires the metric to be invariant under similarity function scaling and sensitive to both local and global distributional shifts\u2014conditions that are difficult to satisfy simultaneously. Furthermore, the non-convex nature of the optimization landscape in similarity-based diversity makes it hard to ensure convergence and stability across different data types and similarity functions.\n\n---\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrior work, including the Vendi Score, has made progress by proposing reference-free diversity via von Neumann entropy, but they remain computationally prohibitive for large-scale applications. Most existing metrics either depend on reference data (e.g., FID, precision/recall) or are limited to specific domains (e.g., n-gram diversity in text). The lack of a scalable, general-purpose, and theoretically grounded alternative has persisted because: (1) there is no consensus on how to define diversity beyond coverage or quality; (2) computational bottlenecks in eigen-decomposition prevent deployment in real-world settings; and (3) no prior method has successfully decoupled interpretability from computational cost. Our approach differs by introducing a **differentiable, scalable approximation** of the von Neumann entropy using randomized sketching and spectral density estimation, enabling efficient computation while preserving the interpretability and theoretical foundation of the original Vendi Score.\n\n---\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nWe propose **Vendi-Sketch**, a scalable, differentiable approximation of the Vendi Score using randomized matrix sketching and kernel density estimation of eigenvalue distributions. Key components:  \n- **Method**: Use a subsampled randomized Hadamard transform (SRHT) to compress the similarity matrix $ K \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n} $ into a smaller matrix $ \\tilde{K} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k \\times k} $, where $ k \\ll n $. Compute the eigenvalues of $ \\tilde{K} $, estimate their density using kernel density estimation (KDE), and compute the von Neumann entropy as $ H = -\\sum_i \\lambda_i \\log \\lambda_i $. The Vendi-Sketch score is $ \\exp(H) $.  \n- **Dataset**: Evaluate on diverse benchmarks: (1) image generation (CIFAR-10, ImageNet), (2) text generation (WikiText, GPT-2 outputs), (3) molecular generation (ZINC, ChEMBL), and (4) synthetic data with known diversity.  \n- **Metrics**: Compare against Vendi Score (ground truth), FID, Precision/Recall, and n-gram diversity. Measure scalability (runtime vs. dataset size), correlation with human judgment (in image/text), and sensitivity to mode collapse.  \n- **Expected Outcomes**: (1) A 10\u2013100x speedup over the original Vendi Score with <5% error on all benchmarks; (2) strong correlation with human perception of diversity; (3) robustness across similarity functions (e.g., cosine, RBF, BERT-based); (4) open-source implementation with API for integration into training pipelines.

The core difficulty is balancing interpretability (e.g., effective number of distinct elements) with computational scalability and theoretical rigor. Additionally, ensuring stability under varying similarity functions (e.g., cosine vs. Gaussian kernels) while avoiding degeneracy (e.g., overestimation due to noise or spurious similarities) presents significant technical hurdles.

Unlike vector-space representations, where similarity can be captured via distance metrics or inner products, graphs lack a natural, invariant metric that simultaneously respects structural equivalence (e.g., isomorphism) and semantic variation (e.g., attribute differences). \n\nThe core difficulty lies in defining a **graph similarity function** that is both **discriminative** (able to distinguish structurally and semantically distinct graphs) and **invariant** (robust to isomorphic relabeling, noise, and scale variations), while remaining computationally tractable for large-scale applications. Existing graph kernels or embedding methods (e.g., Graph Neural Networks, Weisfeiler-Lehman) often prioritize either topology or semantics, but not both in a balanced, principled way\u2014leading to biased or incomplete diversity assessments.\n\nFurthermore, extending the Vendi Score\u2014originally defined on a similarity matrix of vectors\u2014to graphs requires constructing a **graph similarity matrix** where each entry reflects the similarity between two graphs. This raises several technical hurdles:  \n- **Computational intractability**: Computing pairwise graph similarities for large collections of graphs (e.g., thousands) is NP-hard under standard definitions (e.g., graph isomorphism testing).  \n- **Semantic-topological trade-off**: A similarity measure that emphasizes topology may ignore meaningful attribute differences, while one favoring attributes may overlook structural novelty.  \n- **Spectral instability**: The eigenvalues of the graph similarity matrix may be sensitive to small perturbations or normalization choices, undermining the stability of the von Neumann entropy (i.e., the Vendi Score).  \n- **Lack of theoretical grounding**: There is no established framework for interpreting the von Neumann entropy of a graph similarity matrix in terms of effective number of \"graph species\" in a population.\n\nNaive approaches\u2014such as using GNN embeddings followed by Euclidean similarity\u2014fail because they collapse the rich relational structure into low-dimensional vectors, losing critical topological information and introducing bias from the encoder\u2019s training objective. Thus, a truly effective graph diversity metric must be **intrinsic**, **reference-free**, and **structure-aware**, which remains an open challenge.\n\n---\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrior work on graph diversity has largely relied on **reference-based** or **embedding-dependent** metrics, such as Fr\u00e9chet Graph Distance (FGD) or graph-level GAN evaluation via Inception scores, which require access to a reference dataset or a pre-trained encoder. These methods are domain-specific, lack interpretability, and fail when no reference is available or when the encoder distorts structural semantics.\n\nOther approaches use **graph kernels** (e.g., Weisfeiler-Lehman, random walk) to compute similarity, but these are typically used for classification or clustering, not for diversity quantification. Moreover, they are often not designed to support entropy-based measures like the Vendi Score, and their output is not easily interpretable as an \"effective number of distinct graphs.\"\n\nThe Vendi Score itself has not been extended to graphs because:\n- There is no standard way to define a **similarity matrix over graphs** that is both scalable and meaningful.\n- The spectral properties of such a matrix are poorly understood in the context of non-Euclidean data.\n- Existing graph similarity measures are either too coarse (e.g., based on global statistics like degree distribution) or too expensive (e.g., based on subgraph isomorphism).\n\nAdditionally, the **interplay between topology and semantics** has not been formally modeled in a unified similarity function. Most graph representation learning methods optimize for downstream tasks (e.g., node classification), not for preserving diversity-relevant features.\n\nThus, the lack of a **general, reference-free, structure-aware similarity framework** for graphs has prevented the application of entropy-based diversity metrics like the Vendi Score. This gap persists because prior research has treated graphs as either point clouds (via embeddings) or discrete objects (via kernels), but not as relational entities whose diversity should be measured in a way that respects both their geometry and semantics.\n\nOur approach differs by **designing a novel, dual-attention graph similarity function** that jointly models topological and semantic heterogeneity, and by **formalizing the Vendi Score in the graph domain** through a spectral framework grounded in graph Laplacian and kernel theory\u2014enabling a principled, scalable, and interpretable measure of graph diversity.\n\n---\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\n**Key Components of the Approach:**\n\n1. **Dual-Attention Graph Similarity Function (DAG-Sim):**  \n   - Design a novel similarity measure between two graphs $ G_i $ and $ G_j $ that combines:\n     - **Topological similarity**: via a normalized graph Laplacian-based kernel (e.g., heat kernel or diffusion kernel) to capture structural proximity.\n     - **Semantic similarity**: via a node attribute kernel (e.g., Gaussian RBF over node features) and a cross-attention mechanism to align attributes across nodes, even under different labeling schemes.\n   - Integrate both components using a learnable fusion gate (e.g., attention weights) to balance topology and semantics, ensuring adaptability across domains.\n\n2. **Graph Embedding-Free Construction of the Similarity Matrix:**  \n   - Avoid pre-trained encoders by computing pairwise similarities directly from graph structure and attributes.\n   - Use a **symmetric, positive semi-definite kernel matrix** $ K \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n} $, where $ K_{ij} = \\text{DAG-Sim}(G_i, G_j) $, to preserve the mathematical foundation of the Vendi Score.\n\n3. **Spectral Stability via Regularization and Normalization:**  \n   - Apply spectral normalization (e.g., scaling eigenvalues to [0,1]) and regularization (e.g., adding a small constant to diagonal) to stabilize the von Neumann entropy computation.\n   - Use randomized sketching or Nystr\u00f6m approximation for large-scale graphs to maintain computational feasibility.\n\n4. **Graph Diversity Metric: The Vendi Score for Graphs (VSG):**  \n   - Define the **Vendi Score for Graphs (VSG)** as:\n     $$\n     \\text{VSG} = \\exp\\left( -\\sum_{k=1}^n \\lambda_k \\log \\lambda_k \\right),\n     $$\n     where $ \\lambda_k $ are the eigenvalues of the normalized similarity matrix $ K $.\n   - Interpret VSG as the **effective number of structurally and semantically distinct graphs** in the collection.\n\n5. **Evaluation Framework:**\n   - **Datasets**: Use benchmark graph datasets with known diversity (e.g., MUTAG, COLLAB, PROTEINS, Reddit, OGBN-Papers100M) and synthetic graph families (e.g., stochastic block models with varying community structure and attribute heterogeneity).\n   - **Metrics**: Compare VSG against baselines (e.g., FGD, GAN evaluation scores, entropy of GNN embeddings) using:\n     - **Consistency**: Does VSG increase when adding structurally novel graphs?\n     - **Sensitivity**: Does VSG detect subtle changes in topology/semantics?\n     - **Robustness**: Is VSG invariant to isomorphism and resilient to noise?\n   - **Applications**: Evaluate VSG in:\n     - **Graph generative model evaluation** (e.g., GANs, VAEs).\n     - **Active learning** on graphs: selecting diverse training samples.\n     - **Scientific discovery**: identifying novel subgraphs in biological or chemical networks.\n\n**Expected Outcomes:**\n- A **new, reference-free, scalable, and interpretable graph diversity metric (VSG)** that outperforms existing methods in capturing both topological and semantic heterogeneity.\n- **Theoretical justification** of VSG as a generalization of ecological diversity to non-Euclidean data.\n- **Open-source implementation** (Python package) with support for large-scale graph collections.\n- **Empirical validation** showing VSG improves model generalization, reduces overfitting in graph learning, and enables more diverse and robust training sets.\n\nThis work will establish a new standard for evaluating diversity in graph-structured machine learning, enabling more responsible, generalizable, and scientifically insightful AI systems."}, "task_results": [{"agent1": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"papers\": []}"}], "summary": "{\n  \"agent1\": {\n    \"result\": {\n      \"success\": true,\n      \"papers\": []\n    }\n  },\n  \"analysis\": \"The result from Agent1 indicates that no relevant papers were retrieved during the literature review phase.

The introduction clearly identifies shortcomings in existing metrics (e.g., FID, precision-recall frameworks) that rely on reference datasets or pretrained encoders, and proposes the Vendi Score as a novel, ecologically inspired alternative based on von Neumann entropy of a similarity matrix.

This supports the validity of proceeding with a new research idea built upon the Vendi Score framework.\",\n  \"final_output\": {\n    \"[Question 1] - What is the problem?\": \"How can we design a robust, reference-free, and domain-agnostic diversity metric for machine learning that adapts to arbitrary similarity functions while being theoretically grounded and computationally feasible across diverse data types?\",\n    \n    \"[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?\": \"Solving this problem would establish a unified, principled framework for evaluating diversity across domains\u2014such as text, molecules, images, and scientific discoveries\u2014without requiring access to reference data or pretrained models. This advancement would enable fairer evaluation of generative models, active learning strategies, and dataset curation methods, especially in low-resource or privacy-sensitive settings. It would also open new avenues for research in scientific discovery, where diverse and novel hypotheses are critical. A widely applicable diversity metric could become a standard benchmark, influencing how ML systems are developed and validated, and promoting innovation in model transparency and robustness.\",\n    \n    \"[Question 3] - Why is it hard?\": \"Designing a metric that is both theoretically sound and practically scalable is challenging. The Vendi Score relies on computing eigenvalues of an n\u00d7n similarity matrix, which is computationally expensive (O(n\u00b3)) and memory-intensive for large datasets. Moreover, the sensitivity of eigenvalues to noise, non-stationarity, and high-dimensional embeddings can lead to unstable or misleading diversity scores. Choosing an appropriate similarity function is also non-trivial\u2014different choices may yield divergent results even for the same data, requiring domain expertise. Naive approaches, such as using approximate eigenvalue estimation or fixed similarity kernels, can fail to preserve interpretability or consistency. Additionally, validating the metric requires establishing ground-truth diversity benchmarks, which are scarce or subjective in real-world applications.\",\n    \n    \"[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?\": \"Prior work has either relied on reference datasets (e.g., FID, precision-recall) or domain-specific heuristics (e.g., n-gram diversity), limiting generalization. While the Vendi Score concept is novel, its full potential has not been explored due to computational constraints and the lack of standardized evaluation protocols. Existing methods fail to balance flexibility with theoretical rigor\u2014either being too rigid (dependent on reference data) or too ad hoc (e.g., heuristic similarity measures). This work differs by proposing a comprehensive framework: (1) a formal extension of ecological diversity to ML via von Neumann entropy; (2) a modular design allowing any user-defined similarity function; and (3) a systematic study of scalability, stability, and interpretability across domains\u2014addressing both theoretical and practical gaps left by prior work.\",\n    \n    \"[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?\": \"Our approach will consist of: (1) implementing the Vendi Score using efficient eigenvalue approximation (e.g., randomized SVD or Nystr\u00f6m method) to handle large-scale data; (2) testing the metric on diverse datasets (text, molecular SMILES, images) using various similarity functions (e.g., cosine, Gaussian, graph kernels); (3) validating results against human judgments and established metrics (e.g., FID, BLEU, ROUGE) where possible; (4) conducting ablation studies to analyze sensitivity to similarity function choice and noise. We will release a public library with benchmark datasets and evaluation scripts. Expected outcomes include: (a) a scalable, open-source implementation of the Vendi Score; (b) empirical evidence of its superiority in reference-free settings; (c) a framework for principled diversity evaluation that can be adopted across ML subfields. This will position the Vendi Score as a foundational tool for future research in generative modeling, active learning, and scientific discovery.\"\n  }\n}", "continue_simulation": true, "communications": [], "total_milestones": 2, "agent_kpis": {"agent2": 2}}, {"iteration": 5, "task_assignments": {"agent1": "**Next Task: [Question 3] - Why is it hard?**", "agent2": "Based on the provided task history, the team has successfully completed the following steps:\n\n1.  **Literature Review:** Analyzed the provided Introduction on diversity metrics and reviewed recent, relevant papers on related topics (catastrophic forgetting in LLMs, CLIP-based CIL, fairness in recommendation, and VAEs for tabular data).\n2.  **Brainstorming:** Collaborated to generate a diverse set of research ideas, leveraging the insights from the literature and the researcher's unique expertise in algebraic geometry, functional analysis, and graph theory.\n3.  **Summarization:** Synthesized the collective ideas into a clear direction.\n\nThe final and most critical task is now to **formulate a new research idea** in the specified '5q' format.

(2020); Rivlin et al. (2020); St\u00e5hlberg et al. (2022a),\none key expressive limitation results from the types of features used to\nclassify state transitions or actions. In combinatorial approaches, features are\nselected from a domain-independent pool, created using a description logic\ngrammar\u00a0Baader et al. (2003) based on the given domain\npredicates\u00a0Bonet and\nGeffner (2018); Bonet et al. (2019), while in deep\nlearning approaches, the features are learned using relational versions of graph\nneural networks\nScarselli et al. (2009); Gilmer et al. (2017); Hamilton (2020). A shared\nlimitation of both approaches, however, is their inability to learn\npolicies requiring complex logical features. This limitation arises in\ndescription logics from the C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT fragment of first-order logic that they\ncapture; namely, first-order logic limited to two variables and\ncounting\u00a0Baader et al. (2003), and in GNNs, from the type of message passing\nthat is accommodated, where direct communication involves pairs of objects but\nno triplets\u00a0Grohe (2021).\n\n\nThis expressive limitation, not always acknowledged, is serious. For example,\nalthough these methods can learn general policies for guiding an agent to a\nspecific cell in an n\u00d7n\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5bn\\times nitalic_n \u00d7 italic_n grid containing obstacles, with\npositions and adjacency relations defined in terms of cells and atoms such as\nAt\u2062(c)At\ud835\udc50\\textsc{At}(c)At ( italic_c ) and Adj\u2062(c,c\u2032)Adj\ud835\udc50superscript\ud835\udc50\u2032\\textsc{Adj}(c,c^{\\prime})Adj ( italic_c , italic_c start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), they lack the expressive\ncapacity when the relations are represented with atoms like At\u2062(x,y)At\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66\\textsc{At}(x,y)At ( italic_x , italic_y ),\nAdj1\u2062(x,x\u2032)subscriptAdj1\ud835\udc65superscript\ud835\udc65\u2032\\textsc{Adj}_{1}(x,x^{\\prime})Adj start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_x , italic_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), and Adj2\u2062(y,y\u2032)subscriptAdj2\ud835\udc66superscript\ud835\udc66\u2032\\textsc{Adj}_{2}(y,y^{\\prime})Adj start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_y , italic_y start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ). Similarly, these methods\nare unable to learn policies for classical benchmark domains such as Logistics\nand Grid, that require composition of binary relations, which is beyond the\nscope of C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\u00a0[St\u00e5hlberg et al.,\n2022b; 2023].\n\n\nIn principle, this limitation can be addressed by using richer grammars to\ngenerate non-C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT features or by using k\ud835\udc58kitalic_k-GNNs, for k=3\ud835\udc583k=3italic_k = 3, where triplets of\nobjects are embedded instead of individual objects\u00a0Morris et al.

The architecture for R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] mirrors that of plain R-GNNs\nand differs only in the input.

We propose a novel benchmark based on Sokoban puzzles, intentionally simplified to isolate long-horizon planning from state persistence. Our findings reveal a consistent degradation in planning performance when more than 25 moves are required to reach the solution, suggesting a fundamental constraint on forward planning capacity. We show that equipping LRMs with Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) parsing, validation, and solving tools allows for modest improvements, suggesting inherent architectural limitations which might not be overcome by test-time scaling approaches alone.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20856v1\", \"timestamp\": 1769626560, \"sections\": {\"1 Introduction\": \"\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nAutomated Planning, i.e. the task of generating sequences of actions to achieve a goal, is a well-studied problem in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) (Ghallab et al., 2016), since it requires AI systems to exhibit cognitive abilities such as reasoning, understanding, and efficient state space search (Wei et al., 2025).\\nTo this end, automated planning literature has focused on the use of formal languages, such as the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) (McDermott and others, 1998; Russell and Norvig, 2021; Haslum et al., 2019)), and of tree-search strategies or specific heuristics to find optimal solutions (Bonet and Geffner, 2001).\\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) and, in particular, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) i.e., LLMs trained to produce so-called reasoning traces resembling structured thought processes, have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language understanding, knowledge retrieval and multi-modal pattern recognition (Jaech et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2025; Team et al., 2025).\\nHowever, recent studies highlighted the limitations of such models when applied to planning tasks (Valmeekam et al., 2023b; Shojaee et al., 2025).\\nFor instance, internal reasoning processes have been shown to resemble a form of wandering through the solution space rather than a systematic exploration (Lu et al., 2025).\\nThis distinction becomes particularly important for problems that require maintaining sequential state information, such as spatial exploration in constrained environments. In these settings, effective tracking of working memory is necessary to infer the agent\\u2019s latent previous state (Zhang et al., 2024).\\n\\n\\nIn this work, we investigate the long-horizon planning abilities of LRMs using a highly simplified variant of the Sokoban puzzle\\u00a0(Culberson, 1998). Rather than increasing spatial complexity, we deliberately minimize the structural complexity of the environment while preserving the long-horizon nature of the task by creating examples with\\nthe lowest possible branching factor compatible with solvability: a single movable block placed within a linear corridor with tightly controlled geometry.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis setting allows us to isolate long-horizon planning from state persistence: models are required to produce complete solution sequences without external memory, intermediate feedback, or state validation, relying solely on internal state representations to track the evolving environment.\\nWe therefore investigate to what extent LRMs can sustain coherent planning over long (but simple) action sequences and whether even minimal reasoning branching in otherwise trivial Sokoban instances is sufficient to induce planning failures.\\n\\n\\nConcretely, we examine whether current LRMs can reliably solve linear-corridor Sokoban puzzles with minimal possible branching and identify the point at which increases in horizon length lead to catastrophic breakdowns in action validity, despite the simplicity of the underlying environment.\\nAs we will show these minimal sub-problems which are trivial to humans (Jaru\\u0161ek and Pel\\u00e1nek, 2010), are still challenging for Large Reasoning Models as shown by other preliminary studies involving spatial intelligence (Cai et al., 2025).\\nWe posit this as a systemic deficiency in long-term action representation and sequential logic, and in spatial reasoning and thus as an important limitation of current LRMs that is not yet fully understood.\\n\\n\", \"2 Related Work\": \"\\n\\n2 Related Work\\n\\n\\n2.1 Benchmarks for LLM Planning\\n\\nAs mentioned above, planning requires LLMs to blend logical, numerical, and spatial reasoning with long-horizon strategic adaptation, rather than just relying on pattern matching or memorization.\\nClassical planning domains expressed in or derived from the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL (Fox and Long, 2003)), such as BlocksWorld (Slaney and Thi\\u00e9baux, 2001), Towers of Hanoi and similar tasks (Pallagani et al., 2023), remain a common benchmark choice, though earlier attempts date back to the pre-ChatGPT era (Silver et al., 2022).\\nTest suites like PlanBench (Valmeekam et al., 2022) introduced structured, domain-agnostic evaluations inspired by classical planning (Ghallab et al., 2016), including plan generation (Oswald et al., 2024; Valmeekam et al., 2025; La Malfa et al., 2025) and optimality (Valmeekam et al., 2022; Zhai and others, 2025; Valmeekam et al., 2023a).\\n\\n\\nIn another line of work, planning is evaluated within agentic or workflow-based frameworks, where LLMs are required to decompose goals into multiple sub-plans (Meyerson et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025; La Malfa et al., 2025).\\nThe results in these settings are encouraging though highly cost intensive.\\nImportantly, when not equipped with external tools or made part of larger workflows (e.g., enabling stateful tracking (Hu et al., 2025b)), innate planning abilities remain still weak (Schepanowski and Ling, 2025).\\nEven the latest foundational models are found to consistently fail in delivering correct sequences of actions (in any format or language) due to two primary deficits: weak internal state representations leading to invalid moves and misleading heuristic search resulting in loops or early termination, as shown in the textual game \\u201c8-puzzle\\u201d in Schepanowski and Ling (2025).\\nMoreover, efficacy of different prompting techniques is model-dependent in a non-predictable way (Schepanowski and Ling, 2025; Deng et al., 2025).\\n\\n\\nOther works have systematically investigated the performances of LLMs in playing textual games with gym-style APIs (Brockman et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2025a).\\nBeyond structured puzzles, community-driven and informal game-oriented benchmarks like word-game bench (Stojanovski, 2024) and nonogram logic puzzles (Berend et al., 2014; Kleine, 2026) with multi-difficulty instances have been devised to measure how well models plan under both explicit and implicit constraints, track environment states, and adapt over multiple turns.\\nThe varying depth of planning ability required helps to reveal how performance scales with complexity and structure.\\n\\n\\nIn general, existing benchmarks using specific planning languages and/or internal reasoning traces expressed in natural language show that LLMs exhibit limited planning abilities in various domains (Kambhampati et al., 2024), especially as the complexity and horizon length of the problems increase.\\nThis gap motivates the development of new benchmarks tailored to planning and solving structured textual puzzles with LLMs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2.2 Sokoban as a Benchmark for Planning\\n\\nThe Sokoban puzzle involves spatial planning in a highly constrained environment. Solvable Sokoban maps can be generated efficiently (Murase et al., 1996), and the environment is fully controllable and deterministic. These properties enable rigorous evaluation using exact solvers and verifiers, as well as metrics such as search depth and solution time (Jaru\\u0161ek and Pel\\u00e1nek, 2010; Shoham and Schaeffer, 2020).\\nUnlike puzzles such as the Tower of Hanoi, which can be solved by repeating a simple pattern for larger instances, Sokoban offers no shortcuts.\\nEach map is unique, and moving a single box can block or open paths in ways that prevent a one-size-fits-all solution.\\nAs a result, Sokoban is considered a good benchmark for evaluating planning abilities in the 2023 edition of the International Planning Competition\\u00a0(Taitler et al., 2024).\\n\\n\\nRecently, recurrent neural networks (non LLM-based) trained over multiple examples of Sokoban puzzles have obtained state of the art performance (Jolicoeur-Martineau, 2025; Taufeeque et al., 2024).\\nHowever, LLMs are found to perform poorly, struggling even with simple maps and correctly solving only a small fraction of instances: Valmeekam et al. (2025) report success rates of just about 10\\u201312% when using the OpenAI o1-preview model directly.\\nIn contrast, substantially higher success rates are achieved in an LLM-Modulo setting, where the same model is used to generate plans that are then executed by an external planner, yielding approximately 43% solved instances for o1-preview (and about 10% for o1-mini), albeit at significantly higher computational cost.\\n\\n\\nMost prior work on textual puzzle solving and planning with LLMs has emphasized high-level notions such as search depth, branching factor, or overall puzzle complexity.\\nMuch less attention has been paid to the role of simpler, low-level operations that these tasks implicitly rely on.\\nEvidence from seemingly trivial problems suggests that LLM failures do not always stem from complexity itself, but from how basic reasoning steps are elicited.\\nA well-known example is the character-counting question \\u201chow many r\\u2019s are in strawberry?\\u201d (Karpathy, 2024), which has sparked debate over whether LLM errors are caused by tokenization or deeper representational limits\\u00a0(Shin and Kaneko, 2024).\\nThe work by Xu and Ma (2025) revisits this issue through a careful empirical study, showing that LLMs are in fact capable of performing these simple symbolic operations, but often fail unless prompted to reason explicitly.\\nCharacter-level benchmarks, such as CharBench (Uzan and Pinter, 2025), shows that modern LLMs struggle with simple character counting and positioning tasks not because tokenization fully explains these errors, but because intrinsic properties like word length and actual character count have a stronger influence on performance, indicating that basic symbolic operations are not reliably deployed unless the model is guided to engage them explicitly.\\n\\n\\nPut together, these observations point to a broader interpretation of failures in spatial planning and puzzle games, suggesting that they may arise from missing or weak activation of basic operations, rather than from the inherent difficulty of the planning problem.\\n\\n\\n\", \"3 Methods\": \"\\n\\n3 Methods\\n\\n\\n3.1 Sokoban game\\n\\nFigure\\u00a01 shows an example of a Sokoban puzzle and the game\\u2019s central mechanic: the player controls a sprite that pushes boxes within a two-dimensional spatially constrained environment with the goal to position them onto predefined locations.\\nDespite its apparent simplicity, Sokoban is a NP-hard and PSPACE-complete problem (Culberson, 1998), positioning it as a canonical domain for symbolic and hierarchical planning.\\nApart from the pictorial representation, Sokoban maps can be encoded using an ASCII-based symbolic representation as expressed in Table\\u00a01.\\nSequences of main character actions are typically encoded in LURD format (left,up,right,down), with lowercase letters indicating simple moves, and uppercase letters indicating box pushes.\\nAlthough moves and pushes have distinct notations in classical Sokoban planning, in our experiments we restrict only to comma-separated uppercase letters.\\nThis representation does not compromise the information content of the solutions and simplifies the output format for language models, avoiding potential mistakes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 1: Example of a Sokoban puzzle.

The maps share the same initial configuration in which the goal is positioned at one end of the map, the player at the opposite end, and the box placed in between the two, so that all elements lie along the same row or column.\\nThis choice is motivated by its simplicity: the corridor length \\u2113\\\\ell is the only map parameter and it serves as a proxy for map difficulty.\\nHence, with just one degree of freedom to account for, we overcome the problem of defining complex measures for solution difficulty: the longer the map, the harder the task.\\n\\n\\nIn our benchmark, we consider map lengths \\u2113\\\\ell ranging from 5 to 100 in increments of 5. For each map, we generate four augmented variants corresponding to rotations of 90\\u221890^{\\\\circ}, 180\\u2218180^{\\\\circ}, and 270\\u2218270^{\\\\circ}, as well as the original (unrotated) orientation.\\nThis augmentation strategy reduces the risk of querying the model with data that may have been encountered during pretraining and enables analysis of whether models exhibit orientation-dependent performance.\\nIn total, the evaluation set comprises 80 distinct maps, spanning 20 values of \\u2113\\\\ell with four orientations each.\\nWe publicly release our dataset at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Linello/sokobanlevels.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3 Experimental Setup\\n\\nWe employ both open and closed weights model, specifically DeepSeek R1 (Guo et al., 2025), GPT-5 and GPT-oss 120B\\u00a0(OpenAI, 2026; 2025).\\nThey are all reasoning models, i.e., they are configured to generate an explicit reasoning trace prior to emitting the final answer to the user query.\\nFor GPT models, we don\\u2019t change the default temperature neither the default reasoning effort (set to medium).\\nInstead we cap the maximum number of completion tokens (including both reasoning and final answer tokens) at 32,76832{,}768.\\nAll inference calls are routed through OpenRouter,111https://openrouter.ai/ with the inference provider consistently set to DeepInfra.222https://deepinfra.com/\\nIn light of both computational and financial resource constraints, we limit our empirical analysis to these two primary model families.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3.1 1-shot Inference\\n\\nIn the first experimental setup, we test the ability of the selected LRMs to solve simple Sokoban puzzles when provided only with the instructions, the mapping of characters as in Table\\u00a01 and a single demonstration.\\nUnder this setup, thus, models are by design limited to use exclusively their internal state representations to solve Sokoban puzzles of varying solution lengths.\\nThe prompts used for all models are described in Appendix A.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3.2 LLM-Modulo\\n\\nIn the second experimental setup, we investigated how Sokoban puzzle\\u2013solving performance can be enhanced when LRMs are provided with access to external planning solvers, within an LLM-modulo framework analogous to that of Valmeekam et al. (2023a).\\nTo this end, we prompted the models to generate specific instances of planning problems while providing them with a pre-existing, human-authored and verified PDDL domain (Appendix B.2).\\nIn this setup, the model is responsible solely for formulating the PDDL problem, which is then processed through an agentic pipeline.\\nThis workflow utilizes a domain parser to instantiate the formal world representation and a dedicated problem parser that acts as a validator, informing the model whether the generated problem is syntactically and semantically well-formed.\\nFinally, the pipeline provides access to specialized PDDL planners such as Fast-Downward or PyperPlan, integrated via the Unified Planning library (Micheli et al., 2025; Alkhazraji et al., 2020; Helmert, 2006) to solve the problem and get the optimal plan.\\nAll the tools were wrapped and made accessible to the LRMs via a custom Model Context Protocol library (Anthropic, 2024) implemented with FastMCP library (Lowin, 2024).\\nThe design of our architecture is shown in Figure\\u00a02.\\n\\n\\nThe planner tool produces a variety of diagnostic and informational messages that are provided back to the model, including error reports, timing information, and the complete raw response.\\nThis raw response can be further processed to extract the LURD solution in cases where the problem is successfully solved.\\nIn failure scenarios, the tool returns the encountered errors in natural language to the LRM.\\nErrors or warnings are generated in situations such as logically inconsistent or unsatisfiable problems, invalid or inappropriate initial conditions, or when the solver exceeds the maximum allotted execution time (60 seconds).\\nThe agentic loop ends either with a valid plan or with a message to the final user explaining that, after three failed attempts (which may include having the LRM reformulate the PDDL problem), the agent could not find a satisfactory solution.\\n\\n\\nThe LRM-modulo pipeline is considerably slower than the reasoning-only one.\\nIt took an average of 75 minutes using GPT-5-mini on an AWS t3.xlarge instance (4 CPUs at 3.1 GHz, 16 GB RAM) to collect the points shown in Figure\\u00a06(a).\\nThe prompts being used for the experiments are described in Appendix\\u00a0B.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: Panel (a) represents a simple schema of our LLM-modulo pipeline. The detailed input prompts are collected in Appendix\\u00a0B.1, while an example of output is shown in Panel (b).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4 Evaluation\\n\\nA solution to a Sokoban instance is defined as a sequence of actions that transforms the system from its initial configuration to the final state, where all boxes are correctly placed on goal positions.\\nMultiple valid solutions may exist for the same map, however we restrict the evaluation only to optimal solutions, i.e., sequences that achieve the goal with the minimum possible number of moves. The intrinsic simplicity of our setting makes optimality the natural criterion.\\nClearly, the one-dimensional layout of the map allows only for a unique optimal solution.\\n\\n\\nAccuracy:\\n\\nGiven a map of length \\u2113\\\\ell, we define the accuracy in Eq.\\u00a01 as the expectation, over all repetitions and rotations NN of the indicator of exact string equality (via Iverson brackets) between the predicted action sequence \\ud835\\udc31^(\\u2113)\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}^{(\\\\ell)} and the ground-truth sequence \\ud835\\udc31(\\u2113)\\\\mathbf{x}^{(\\\\ell)}, i.e., the fraction of trials in which the two character strings are identical:\\n\\n\\n\\nAccuracy\\u200b(\\u2113)=1N\\u200b\\u2211n=1N[\\ud835\\udc31^(\\u2113)=\\ud835\\udc31(\\u2113)].\\\\rm{Accuracy}(\\\\ell)=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{n=1}^{N}[\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}^{(\\\\ell)}=\\\\mathbf{x}^{(\\\\ell)}].\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n\\nHere NN is the product of the total number of trials ntn_{t} and the number of map rotations nr=4n_{r}=4.\\nIncreasing ntn_{t} mitigates the intrinsic non-determinism of the obtained solutions, by sampling at multiple seeds.\\nIn the LRM experiments, we set the number of repetitions ntn_{t} to 8.\\nConversely, in the LRM-modulo experiments, the substantially higher computational and monetary costs imposed stricter constraints.\\nWe therefore reduced the number of repetitions ntn_{t} to 4.\\n\\n\\n\\nPrefix accuracy:\\n\\nAlongside the standard accuracy metric, we define Prefix Accuracy (Eq.\\u00a02) to provide a more granular evaluation of model performance.\\nThis metric calculates the average proportion of correct symbols generated by comparing the predicted and true plans\\u2019 strings element-wise:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrefixAccuracy\\u200b(\\u2113)=1N\\u200b\\u2211n=1N[m(n)\\u2264\\u2113]\\u2113\\u200b\\u2211i=1m(n)[x^i(n)=xi(n)],\\\\text{PrefixAccuracy}(\\\\ell)=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{n=1}^{N}\\\\frac{[m^{(n)}\\\\leq\\\\ell]}{\\\\ell}\\\\sum_{i=1}^{m^{(n)}}[\\\\hat{x}_{i}^{(n)}=x_{i}^{(n)}],\\n\\n(2)\\n\\n\\nwhere m(n)m^{(n)} is the length of the predicted plan \\ud835\\udc31^(n)\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}^{(n)}.\\nUnlike the hard matching of the standard accuracy metric, prefix-accuracy is more optimistic, rewarding the model for correct partial trajectories even if it stops prematurely.\\nHowever, it remains strictly penalized for overshooting: if the predicted length m(n)m^{(n)} exceeds the ground-truth length \\u2113\\\\ell, the score for that trial is 0.\\nFor instance, a prediction \\ud835\\udc31^(n)=(l, l, l)\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}^{(n)}=(\\\\texttt{l, l, l}) against a ground truth \\ud835\\udc31(n)=(l, l, l, l)\\\\mathbf{x}^{(n)}=(\\\\texttt{l, l, l, l}) yields a score of 3/43/4, whereas any prediction exceeding length 4 results in a score of 0.\\n\\n\\n\\nManhattan Distance:\\n\\nWhile string-based metrics evaluate the symbolic fidelity of the action sequence, they do not account for the spatial proximity of the agent to the objective.\\nWe therefore use the Manhattan Distance (Eq.\\u00a03) to measure the L1L_{1} distance between the agent\\u2019s terminal position and the goal, independent of sequence semantics or environmental obstacles.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nD\\u200b(\\u2113)=1N\\u200b\\u2211n=1N(|xfinal(n)\\u2212xgoal(n)|+|yfinal(n)\\u2212ygoal(n)|)D(\\\\ell)=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{n=1}^{N}\\\\left(|x^{(n)}_{\\\\text{final}}-x^{(n)}_{\\\\text{goal}}|+|y^{(n)}_{\\\\text{final}}-y^{(n)}_{\\\\text{goal}}|\\\\right)\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere, (xfinal(n),yfinal(n))(x^{(n)}_{\\\\text{final}},y^{(n)}_{\\\\text{final}}) represents the agent\\u2019s coordinates after executing all moves in the predicted sequence \\ud835\\udc31^(n)\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}^{(n)}, starting from the origin (0,0)(0,0). The goal coordinates (xgoal(n),ygoal(n))(x^{(n)}_{\\\\text{goal}},y^{(n)}_{\\\\text{goal}}) are always at a fixed distance \\u2113\\\\ell from the origin, specifically (\\u00b1\\u2113,0)(\\\\pm\\\\ell,0) for 0\\u2218/180\\u22180^{\\\\circ}/180^{\\\\circ} rotations and (0,\\u00b1\\u2113)(0,\\\\pm\\\\ell) for 90\\u2218/270\\u221890^{\\\\circ}/270^{\\\\circ} rotations.\\n\\n\\nThe primary motivation for this metric is to distinguish between \\u201cnear-misses\\u201d and total navigational failures.\\nBy measuring spatial displacement, we can quantify whether a model that failed the exact string match nonetheless moved in the correct direction or reached the vicinity of the goal.\\nThis provides a soft failure signal that string-based metrics like Accuracy or Prefix Accuracy cannot capture.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"4 Results\": \"\\n\\n4 Results\\n\\n\\n4.1 1-shot Inference\\n\\nFigure\\u00a03 summarizes the results in terms of accuracy and total token usage.\\nThe plot on the left of Figure\\u00a03 shows the accuracy as a function of the corridor length, \\u2113\\\\ell, for all tested models.\\nSimilarly to Shojaee et al. (2025), our results show approximately three regions in which the models behave according to different regimes: an easier region where corridor lengths are short, characterized by higher accuracy; an intermediate region characterized by a rapid decrease in accuracy as the length of the corridors increases and a harder region in which the models completely fail to return a correct plan.\\nThese regions are specific to each model.\\n\\n\\nCrucially, corridors are deep but narrow problems: many sequential steps (depth d\\u223c\\u2113d\\\\sim\\\\ell) with minimal branching.\\nIn such settings, a small per-step probability pwp_{w} of miscounting the size of the map compounds exponentially, yielding success probability \\u223c(1\\u2212pw)\\u2113\\\\sim(1-p_{w})^{\\\\ell}.\\nThis may explain the three-region performance curve we observe: short corridors tolerate occasional drift, producing a plateau of acceptable accuracy; intermediate lengths mark the onset of exponential decay, while long corridors see near-total collapse as cumulative errors dominate.\\nWe thus believe that the main reason LRMs cannot correctly plan in longer corridors is mainly due to internal counting representation.\\nIt was indeed shown in McCoy et al. (2024) that when asked to count individual characters, LLMs perform better with common characters than uncommon ones (like #).\\nThis counting failure can be interpreted through the lens of Lu et al. (2025) \\u201cwandering vs systematic exploration\\u201d framework: maintaining an accurate count over many positions is equivalent to maintaining correct state representations across a chain of transitions.\\n\\n\\nAs an observation, we report that GPT-5-mini displays an anomalous accuracy peak around \\u2113=50\\\\ell=50 which is however hardly explained by the model above.\\nWe believe this effect is likely due to memorization, but without access to internal states models this remains an hypothesis.\\n\\n\\nFigure\\u00a03 shows the number of output tokens as a function of the corridor length, \\u2113\\\\ell, filtering only for correctly solved Sokoban problems.\\nLinear regression analysis reveals that for each model, the number of output tokens for correctly predicted problems increases with the length of the corridor.\\nWe don\\u2019t observe the counterintuitive scaling mentioned by Shojaee et al. (2025) with models declining the request to do very long reasoning to solve complex problems.\\nInstead, we report the reasoning effort increasing almost linearly with problem complexity, with none of the three models declining our request early.\\n\\n\\nFigure 3: Accuracy and number of reasoning tokens for LRM experiment. Left: average accuracy. Error bars are computed as the 5th and 95th percentile of responses. Right: scaling behaviour of reasoning length against corridor length filtered for correct solutions only.\\n\\n\\nIn the linear regression analysis above, however only a small fraction of the variance is explained due to the noise of the measurements.\\nThis trend is observed only in the region where \\u2113<50\\\\ell<50, since for larger corridor\\u2019s lengths the number of correct predictions decreases significantly for all tested models.\\nMain parameters of the linear regression fit are collected in Table\\u00a02.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nModel\\nSlope\\n\\ud835\\udc11\\ud835\\udfd0\\\\mathbf{R^{2}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeepSeek R1\\n51.151.1\\n0.350.35\\n\\n\\nGPT-5-mini\\n29.829.8\\n0.620.62\\n\\n\\nGPT-oss 120B\\n39.439.4\\n0.400.40\\n\\n\\n\\nCorrect Answers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nModel\\nSlope\\n\\ud835\\udc11\\ud835\\udfd0\\\\mathbf{R^{2}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeepSeek R1\\n86.3\\n0.25\\n\\n\\nGPT-5-mini\\n55.2\\n0.14\\n\\n\\nGPT-oss 120B\\n85.9\\n0.12\\n\\n\\n\\nWrong Answers\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 2: Fit parameters associated to the linear regressions performed on Figure\\u00a04 (see below).\\n\\n\\nIn Figure\\u00a04 we further analyze the number of emitted tokens as a function of the corridor length parameter \\u2113\\\\ell, considering both correct and incorrect answers.\\nUnlike Shojaee et al. (2025) which observed a counterintuitive reduction in the reasoning effort for problems above a certain threshold of difficulty, we observe a steady increase in the number of output tokens.\\nWhat we found shows that the difficulty of a problem is not characterized by the decrease in the reasoning effort, but instead by the substantially higher variability in token counts of incorrect answers compared to correct ones.\\nThis suggests that when the model diverges from the correct reasoning trajectory, it can fail in multiple ways, whereas successful completions remain more concise and consistent, likely an effect of inductive bias of Group Reinforcement Policy Optimization (GRPO) post-training, where concise reasoning traces are preferred to lengthy ones (Sui et al., 2025).\\nTo quantify this effect, we fit a robust regression of completion tokens against corridor\\u2019s length for each model.\\nBoth slope and intercept appear model-specific: more efficient models, such as GPT-5-mini, show lower slopes and reduced variability across both correct and incorrect responses.\\nAnother relevant distinction can be made, highlighting differences in models\\u2019 calibration.\\nDeepSeek-R1 and GPT-5-mini display similar slopes and intercepts between correct and incorrect predictions, GPT-oss-120B instead reflect large differences in the regression parameters.\\nA recurrent behavior is that for longer corridors, LRMs often reach the maximum allowed number of output tokens.\\nAfter a qualitative inspection of the reasoning traces, we observed that the main reason this happens is that the models get stuck in repeating the same action or reasoning frame over and over until they reach the token limit.\\nWe report the reasoning traces for the interested user at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/sokoban_traces/\\n\\n\\nThis repetitive looping behavior exemplifies what Lu et al. (Lu et al., 2025) classify as unnecessary exploration and failure to maintain a visited-state set. In a systematic search, an agent would track which configurations (or reasoning states) have already been explored and avoid revisiting them. The token-limit exhaustion we observe suggests that LRMs lack such memory: they repeatedly propose the same moves or reasoning steps without recognizing the cycle.\\nThis is evidence of wandering rather than systematic planning: the model explores aimlessly rather than pruning redundant paths.\\nIn a corridor setting, where the state space is essentially linear, even a simple mental tape of visited positions would suffice to prevent loops; the inability to maintain it indicates a fundamental deficit in structured state tracking.\\n\\n\\nFigure 4: Number of completion tokens produced by each model as a function of corridor length. Separate linear regressions are fitted for correct and incorrect responses, with outliers excluded. A small jitter is added to the x-axis to improve visualization.\\n\\n\\nIn Figure\\u00a05 we analyze our data from the point of view of prefix accuracy and Manhattan distance.\\nThe metrics show a decreasing trend for all models that is similar to that represented in Figure\\u00a03.\\nSome patterns, like the peak at \\u2113=50\\\\ell=50 for GPT-5-mini and the increase in accuracy around the central region for DeepSeek R1, are further accentuated.\\nThis highlights that the main source of errors in most Sokoban problems is related to counting mistakes.\\nIn terms of Manhattan distance, the optimal solution would have distance one as the player and the goal are separated by the box.\\nHowever, as observed sometimes the player is positioned exactly on the goal, thus ignoring the spatial constraints of the problem.\\n\\n\\nThese violations, where the predicted sequence places the player on the goal position despite walls and box, are instances of what Lu et al. (2025) terms invalid exploration.\\nIn a valid state-transition graph, certain moves (e.g., walking through walls, teleporting over boxes) are inadmissible.\\nWhen a model proposes such transitions, it demonstrates that its internal representation does not faithfully track the game\\u2019s physics and its constraints.\\nLLMs hallucinate states unreachable under the true transition rules, producing reasoning traces that are syntactically plausible but structurally incoherent for the problem.\\nThe fact that even advanced reasoning models exhibit these errors underscores a core limitation: without explicit state-transition verification, test-time scaling cannot guarantee adherence to problem constraints and rules.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 5: Other useful metrics represented as functions of the corridor\\u2019s length.

here we outline the main constraints and threats to validity.\\nWe focus on one-box linear corridors, which test long-horizon counting and state maintenance rather than the full difficulty of multi-box Sokoban with deadlocks.\\nThus, the benchmark provides only a lower bound on planning ability.\\nFor evaluation, we use exact-plan validation against a reference generator.\\nAlthough this is stricter than necessary in general Sokoban, where multiple optimal plans may exist, it is suitable for corridors; future work will instead use solver-based verification to handle maps with multiple valid solutions.\\nWe also find sensitivity to prompt formatting, especially orientation-related effects such as the many newlines in vertical maps.\\nAlternative encodings, such as row/column numbered grids or other textual cues, may reduce this issue.\\nAnother variability source is model metadata and provider backends: although all calls go through one routing layer, backend implementations and model revisions can change over time.\\nWe log identifiers and dates, but some instability is inherent in API-based evaluations.\\nPretraining contamination is another concern; corridor rotations lower the chance that specific plans were memorized but do not eliminate it.\\nFinally, corridor tasks have limited external validity, since success or failure may not transfer to richer planning domains.\\nWe treat these settings mainly as a sanity check, with follow-up experiments planned to add obstacles, branching structures, and deadlocks.\\n\\n\\n\", \"Societal Impact\": \"\\nSocietal Impact\\n\\nThis paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of Machine Learning through clearer diagnostics of long-horizon planning.\\nWhile any benchmark could have indirect downstream effects by steering research agendas, we do not identify specific societal risks unique to this work beyond standard concerns about evaluation misuse.\\nWe therefore do not highlight any particular societal impacts at this time.\\n\\n\", \"Appendix A Prompts for 1-shot Inference Settings\": \"\\n\\nAppendix A Prompts for 1-shot Inference Settings\\n\\nIn this section we report the detailed prompts that we have used throughout our experiments with reasoning models alone.\\nPrompts are direct, no Chain of Thought elicited as it is known that it may hamper internal reasoning on LRMs.\\nA simple solved problem is provided as the 1-shot example.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSystem Prompt\\n\\n\\n\\u2b07\\nYou are an assistant that helps in solving assigned Sokoban games.\\n\\nYour task is to examine the provided Sokoban problem and find a solution.\\n\\nAll provided Sokoban problems are assigned in form of ASCII maps.\\n\\nThe mapping is the following:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2018\\u2018\\u2018\\n\\n @ - Player\\n\\n + - Player on Goal\\n\\n $ - Box\\n\\n * - Box on Goal\\n\\n . - Goal (Empty)\\n\\n # - Wall Brick\\n\\n\\u2018\\u2018\\u2018\\n\\n\\n\\nThe game is solved when the box is pushed into the goal position, hence when the position of \\u2018$\\u2018 coincides with the position of \\u2018.\\u2018.\\n\\nThe player can move in all the empty spaces of the ASCII map while respecting the walls.\\n\\nWhen the player is adjacent to a box, the player can push the box into an adjacent empty space.\\n\\nAfter pushing a box, the new position of the agent will be the position of the box before the push.\\n\\nThe player cannot pull the box, only push it.\\n\\nThe actions you can perform in the game are:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2018\\u2018\\u2018\\n\\n L - Move Left\\n\\n R - Move Right\\n\\n U - Move Up\\n\\n D - Move Down\\n\\n\\u2018\\u2018\\u2018\\n\\n\\n\\nAll provided problems CAN be solved.\\n\\nYou must give your solution in form of a sequence of allowed actions, separated by commas.\\n\\nYou must give only the sequence of actions, without any additional text or explanation.\\n\\nYou must enclose your solution inside the tags <plan> </plan>.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following is an example of a Sokoban problem and its solution:\\n\\n\\n\\nProblem:\\n\\n\\n\\n#####\\n\\n#@ ##\\n\\n## $ ##\\n\\n # #\\n\\n ##. ##\\n\\n ## #\\n\\n ###\\n\\n\\n\\nSolution:\\n\\n\\n\\n<plan>\\n\\nR,R,D,D\\n\\n</plan>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUser Prompt\\n\\n\\n\\u2b07\\nHere is the Sokoban problem to solve, enclosed in triple backtics:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2018\\u2018\\u2018\\n\\n{{ sokoban_map }}\\n\\n\\u2018\\u2018\\u2018\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"Appendix B Prompts for LLM-Modulo Settings\": \"\\n\\nAppendix B Prompts for LLM-Modulo Settings\\n\\nIn this section, we show the system prompt we used for the experiments on LLM-Modulo settings.\\nThe user prompt remains the same as shown in Appendix\\u00a0A.

At any particular instance of time the deep researcher stores the context of the previous research done and revisits them to decide upon:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nThe next (potentially un-explored) area to be researched.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nRefining the Research Plan if needed.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\n\\nDetermining the percentage Research Progress.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe continue the research process until we have hit a satisfactory threshold of research progress or we have exhausted the maximum retries. The Deep Researcher has an LLM-as-a-judge which analyzes the research performed and decides on the percentage of the research progress. If the researcher crosses the threshold of 90% progress, the research process is halted and a research report is generated.\\n\\n\\nWe generate a research report in a single-shot by an LLM Agent acting as a report writer. The Report Writer Agent has access to the entire research context on the topic and utilises it to generate a Research Report in a single shot. Unlike Google\\u2019s TTD-DR (Test-Time Diffusion) [4] which performs Report-level Denoising inspired by the sampling process in Diffusion models to where they continuously refine the noisy generated initial report iteratively.\\n\\n\", \"2 Sequential Refinement approach vs Parallel Scaling\": \"\\n\\n2 Sequential Refinement approach vs Parallel Scaling\\n\\nThe development of Deep Research Agents (DRAs) has seen the emergence of two primary paradigms for handling complex, multi-faceted research tasks: Parallel Scaling and Sequential Refinement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nParallel Scaling - Efficiency and Its Limitations: Parallel scaling, as implemented in architectures like GPT Researcher [2] and our previous work, Static-DRA [6], focuses on decomposing a research topic into multiple independent sub-topics. These sub-topics are then investigated concurrently by parallel execution agents. While this approach offers significant advantages in terms of reduced latency and stable performance through horizontal scaling, it often suffers from a \\u201dsiloed knowledge\\u201d problem. Because each agent operates within the vacuum of its specific sub-task, the system lacks a holistic \\u201dGlobal Context\\u201d. This isolation makes it difficult for the model to recognize overlapping information, avoid redundant search queries, or make intelligent, real-time modifications to the research plan based on discoveries made in other branches.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nSequential Refinement - Global Context and Dynamic Adaptation: In contrast, the Sequential Refinement approach leverages the iterative nature of the research process. Google\\u2019s TTD-DR (Test-Time Diffusion) [4] architecture exemplifies this by performing \\u201dReport-level Denoising,\\u201d where an initial draft is continuously refined through sequential iterations inspired by diffusion models. Our Deep Researcher advances this paradigm by shifting the focus from report refinement to Sequential Research Plan Refinement. In this model, the agent maintains a centralized Global Research Context - a comprehensive memory of every search trajectory and artifact gathered. By building each research chain explicitly upon previous attempts, the agent can \\u201dlook back\\u201d at its progress and reason about which areas remain unexplored. This allows for dynamic plan refinement, enabling the agent to pivot its strategy at runtime, add unforeseen sub-topics, or terminate redundant paths.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe superiority of sequential scaling is supported by recent findings in \\u201dThe Sequential Edge\\u201d (Chopra 2025) [7] paper, which demonstrates that sequential scaling consistently outperforms the parallel self-consistency paradigm in 95.6% of configurations, with accuracy gains of up to 46.7%. This is attributed to the model\\u2019s ability to reason with a fuller, more integrated context rather than disparate fragments.\\n\\n\\nBy adopting this sequential approach, our Deep Researcher achieved a score of 46.21 on the DeepResearch Bench [1], outperforming leading deep research agents such as Claude Researcher [8], Perplexity Research [13], Grok Deeper Search [17] and many others in the leaderboard [10]. Our architecture ensures that the final One-Shot Report Generation is informed by a unified narrative and high fact density, producing the depth required for PhD-level research.\\n\\n\", \"3 Deep Researcher Design\": \"\\n\\n3 Deep Researcher Design\\n\\n\\n3.1 High Level Design\\n\\nThe high level design of the Deep Researcher includes multiple modules working together to carry out the deep research on a given topic. The design is demonstrated in Figure 2.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: Deep Researcher - High Level Design\\n\\n\\nThe research methodology is structured as a series of sequential iterations, wherein each successive phase leverages findings from previous cycles to facilitate informed decision-making regarding targeted research areas and necessary plan refinements. The summary of the research process is demonstrated in the steps mentioned below.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nStep 1 - Research Plan Curation: The research topic is provided to the Planning agent that curates a research plan for the provided topic. The plan comprises detailed steps to take in order to carry out the research.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nStep 2 - Generate Search Query: The curated plan is read by the Search agent that generates a search query. The agent also reads the global context to understand what all has been already researched and intelligently curates a search query.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\n\\nStep 3 - Answer Search Query: The search query from the previous step is answered by the Search Agent. At this step the agent utilises a Web Search tool to gather recent events and updates regarding the query. The agent also incorporates the Candidate Crossover algorithm to improve the answer generated for the query. The search query and the answer is then added to the global context.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.\\n\\nStep 4 - Research Plan Reflection: The Planning agent reads the current research plan and the global context to decide whether to update the currently followed research plan or not. The agent also decides on what changes to make in the plan if at all needed.\\n\\n\\n\\n5.\\n\\nStep 5 - Research Plan Update (maybe): The Planning agent takes on the plan reflection input from the previous step and makes the necessary updates in the Research Plan if suggested in the previous step. If there\\u2019s no change needed, the existing plan is followed.\\n\\n\\n\\n6.\\n\\nStep 6 - Analyze Research Progress: The Planning agent reads the research plan and the global context to analyze the current state of the research progress. If the research progress has crossed the 90% threshold benchmark, then the research process is ended. Otherwise the research loop is continued again from Step 2.\\n\\n\\n\\n7.\\n\\nStep 7 - One Shot Report generation: Once the research loop ends, we perform one-shot report generation by an LLM agent acting as a report writer. The agent is provided with the current research plan and the global context to write the research report in one go.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe subsequent sections provide a comprehensive and detailed examination of the aforementioned procedural stages.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2 Candidate Crossover algorithm\\n\\nWe implement a Candidate Crossover algorithm that is integrated into Step 3, the phase in which the Search Agent conducts research for a specified query. This algorithm enhances the agent\\u2019s efficiency by deploying multiple candidates to investigate the same query in parallel. Upon completion of their respective investigations, the findings are synthesized through a crossover process to generate a comprehensive and finalized research response. The algorithm is demonstrated in Figure 3.\\n\\n\\nFigure 3: Deep Researcher - Candidate Crossover algorithm\\n\\n\\nOur Candidate Crossover algorithm is inspired by the Self-Evolution algorithm introduced in Google\\u2019s Deep Researcher with Test Time Diffusion (TTD-DR) [4] paper. Each candidate is a unit LLM agent with varied configuration settings. To facilitate the exploration of a large search space during inference, we initialize n candidates (in this paper all research topics were evaluated on n=3 candidates), each with access to a unit LLM Agent having n different configurations of temperature and top_k parameters respectively. By providing each Candidate with varied parameters, we allow each of them to attend to a different space at inference time. These candidates are provided with a search query and additional artifacts obtained from the Web Search tool, and are tasked to generate concise answers retaining all facts and numbers. We use Tavily [14] for web search and aim to receive top 5 search results for a topic from the web. We also make sure to have only relevant web search results with us for writing a report for the research topic. The Tavily Web Search tool [15] provides a score field for every search result returned which defines \\u201cthe relevance score of the search result\\u201d. We have a threshold score value set to 30% which filters out any search result whose score is less than the threshold score.\\n\\n\\nLater during the Cross-over, we combine the information by merging the answers of all the candidates, consolidating the best information from their respective evolutionary paths to curate a final research response and produce superior context for the main report generation process.\\n\\n\\nTTD-DR\\u2019s Self Evolution algorithm can be summarized in the following steps:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nStep 1 - Initial States: LLM Agent units generate diverse output variants (e.g., search query answers) by sampling with varied parameters like temperature and top_k to broaden the search space.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nStep 2 - Environmental Feedback: An LLM-as-a-judge uses auto-raters to evaluate variants on metrics like Helpfulness and provides textual critiques for improvement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nStep 3 - Revision Step: Variants are iteratively revised based on scores and feedback until stopping criteria are met.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nStep 4 - Cross-over: Multiple revised variants are merged into a single high-quality output, consolidating the best information for the final report.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe did not include the Environmental Feedback (Step 2) and the Revision Steps (Step 3) present in the algorithm to reduce the latency of the Report Generation process and inference time complexity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3 Agent\\u2019s Memory: Global Research Context\\n\\nThe Global Research Context serves as the centralized memory repository for the Deep Researcher, enabling a more cohesive sequential refinement model. This module stores the comprehensive history of the research process, including:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nSearch Trajectories: Maintains a detailed log of every search query generated by the Search agent and the corresponding answers produced by the Search Agent with Candidate Crossover algorithm.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nContextual Artifacts: Houses raw data, facts, and numbers gathered from Web Search tools, ensuring that the final report writer has access to the primary evidence discovered during the loop.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nBy maintaining this global state, the system provides the model with the \\u201dglobal context\\u201d necessary to reason across previously explored areas. This prevents the Search agent from drafting redundant search queries and allows the Planning agent to intelligently determine the percentage of research progress based on the totality of information gathered. The Global Research Context is particularly vital during Step 4 (Research Plan Reflection) and Step 5 (Research Plan Update). By accessing this centralized memory, the Planning agent can perform a methodical process of reasoning that synthesizes low-level search results into higher-level insights. Specifically, the importance of the Global Context in these stages includes:\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nAvoiding Redundancy: The Planning agent reviews the existing search trajectories to ensure that subsequent plan updates do not repeat previously explored queries, optimizing the efficiency of the research loop.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\n\\nDynamic Plan Refinement: Access to the full research history (global context) enables the agent to reason about current progress and make intelligent, real-time modifications to the plan based on evidence found, rather than adhering to a rigid, pre-defined structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.\\n\\nInformed Decision-Making: The model uses the \\u201dglobal context\\u201d to decide which areas remain unexplored, ensuring that the updated research plan targets the most relevant and high-impact information gaps.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUnlike parallel architectures that isolate sub-topic research presented in Static DRA [link] and GPT Researcher (link), the global research context ensures that Step 7 (One-Shot Report Generation) is informed by a holistic understanding of the research topic, leading to more insightful and integrated final reports.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4 Sequential Research Plan Refinement via Reflection\\n\\nThe Sequential Research Plan Refinement via Reflection module is the core mechanism that enables our Deep Researcher to adapt its investigative strategy dynamically. Unlike static research architectures that follow a rigid, pre-defined path, this module empowers the Planning agent to evaluate its current progress and pivot based on the information discovered.\\n\\n\\nThe refinement process is executed in two distinct phases:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nReflection Phase (Step 4): The Planning agent performs a critical review of the existing research plan against the Global Research Context. It assesses whether the current search results satisfy the initial research goals or if new, unforeseen sub-topics have emerged that require deeper investigation. This \\u201dlook back\\u201d capability allows the agent to identify gaps in knowledge that a parallel approach might overlook.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nUpdate Phase (Step 5): If the reflection phase identifies a need for adjustment, the Planning agent modifies the research plan at runtime. These modifications may include adding new research steps, re-prioritizing existing tasks, or terminating paths that have proven to be redundant.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis sequential approach leverages findings from previous cycles to facilitate informed decision-making. By building each research chain upon the previous attempt, we align with findings from the Sequential Edge [7] paper, which suggests that sequential scaling consistently outperforms parallel self-consistency by allowing models to reason with fuller, more integrated context. This ensures that the research trajectory remains efficient, avoiding the \\u201dsiloed\\u201d knowledge problem common in parallel scaling architectures like GPT Researcher [2] or Static-DRA [6].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.5 One Shot Report Generation\\n\\nThe One Shot Report Generation module (Step 7) serves as the final synthesis stage of the research process. Unlike architectures such as Google\\u2019s TTD-DR (Test Time Diffusion - Deep Research) [4], which utilize a \\u201dReport-level Denoising\\u201d process to iteratively refine a noisy initial draft through multiple diffusion-inspired steps, our system employs a single, comprehensive generation phase.\\n\\n\\nIn this stage, a specialized LLM agent, designated as the Report Writer, is granted full access to the Global Research Context and the final, refined Research Plan. This access ensures that the agent can draw upon the entire trajectory of search queries, synthesized answers from the Candidate Crossover algorithm, and raw contextual artifacts such as facts and figures gathered during the sequential iterations. By processing this holistic dataset in a single inference pass, the Report Writer can:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nIntegrate Complex Information: Synthesize findings from disparate research branches into a cohesive narrative without the \\u201dsiloed\\u201d knowledge gaps common in parallel scaling architectures.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nMaintain Narrative Consistency: Ensure a unified tone and logical flow throughout the document, as the entire report is generated with the same global perspective.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\n\\nEnsure Fact Density: Utilize the centralized memory to include specific numbers, dates, and evidence discovered during the search phases, producing a detailed report suitable for PhD-level research topics.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis approach prioritizes computational efficiency and reduced latency by avoiding the multiple refinement cycles, while still maintaining high output quality by leveraging the high-fidelity context built during the sequential reflection phases.\\n\\n\\n\", \"4 Evaluation\": \"\\n\\n4 Evaluation\\n\\nOur Deep Researcher is evaluated against the globally recognized DeepResearch Bench [9]. As the primary benchmark for general-purpose Deep Research Agents (DRAs), it comprises 100 doctoral-level research tasks across 22 distinct fields.

novel Deep Researcher architecture, which shifts the paradigm from latency-optimized parallel scaling to an accuracy-driven sequential refinement model. The system\\u2019s core innovations are the Sequential Research Plan Refinement via Reflection and the Candidates Crossover algorithm. Sequential refinement enables the agent to maintain a centralized Global Research Context, allowing it to dynamically adapt its research plan, avoid redundant searches, and overcome the \\u201dsiloed knowledge\\u201d problem inherent in parallel architectures like Static-DRA and GPT Researcher. The Candidates Crossover algorithm further optimized search efficiency by deploying multiple LLM agents with varied parameters to explore a larger search space, with their findings synthesized for a comprehensive final response.\\n\\n\\nThe effectiveness of this approach was demonstrated through rigorous evaluation on the DeepResearch Bench, a global benchmark of 100 doctoral-level research tasks. Powered by the gemini-2.5-pro model, our Deep Researcher achieved a superior overall score of 46.21, significantly surpassing several leading deep research agents. These results reinforce the critical finding that sequential scaling consistently outperforms the parallel self-consistency paradigm, validating the system\\u2019s ability to generate highly detailed, fact-dense reports suitable for PhD-level research using a One Shot Report Generation process that maintains computational efficiency.\\n\\n\"}, \"bibliography\": {\"[1]\": \"\\n[1]\\nM.

However, existing systems largely rely on runtime-centric execution paradigms, repeatedly reading, summarizing, and reasoning over large volumes of scientific literature online. This on-the-spot computation strategy incurs high computational cost, suffers from context window limitations, and often leads to brittle reasoning and hallucination. We propose Idea2Story, a pre-computation-driven framework for autonomous scientific discovery that shifts literature understanding from online reasoning to offline knowledge construction. Idea2Story continuously collects peer-reviewed papers together with their review feedback, extracts core methodological units, composes reusable research patterns, and organizes them into a structured methodological knowledge graph. At runtime, underspecified user research intents are aligned to established research paradigms, enabling efficient retrieval and reuse of high-quality research patterns instead of open-ended generation and trial-and-error. By grounding research planning and execution in a pre-built knowledge graph, Idea2Story alleviates the context window bottleneck of LLMs and substantially reduces repeated runtime reasoning over literature. We conduct qualitative analyses and preliminary empirical studies demonstrating that Idea2Story can generate coherent, methodologically grounded, and novel research patterns, and can produce several high-quality research demonstrations in an end-to-end setting. These results suggest that offline knowledge construction provides a practical and scalable foundation for reliable autonomous scientific discovery.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20833v1\", \"timestamp\": 1769625114, \"bibliography\": {}, \"domain\": \"cs.CE\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"f5d87cea-2ad1-4524-9f60-e04f1ea6d7d2\", \"authors\": [\"Jiangen He\", \"Wen Lou\"], \"title\": \"How Disciplinary Partnerships Shape Research Landscape in U.S. Library and Information Science Schools\", \"abstract\": \"This study provides the first comprehensive empirical mapping of how organizational structures and research portfolios co-occur across U.S. Library and Information Science (LIS) schools. Analyzing 14,705 publications from 1,264 faculty members across 44 institutions (2013--2024), we employ computational methods including word embeddings and topic modeling to identify 16 distinct research themes organized into three foundational dimensions: Library and Knowledge Organization (LKO), Human-Centered Technology (HCT), and Computing Systems (CS). Our mixed-method analysis reveals significant differences in research composition across organizational types: Computer-affiliated schools cluster tightly in computationally-intensive research and differ significantly from all other school types, while independent Information schools demonstrate the greatest research diversity. Temporal analysis of LIS schools reveals complex evolutionary dynamics: 51.4% are moving toward HCT, 37.8% toward CS, and 37.8% toward LKO, with many schools simultaneously shifting along multiple dimensions. Contrary to narratives of computational dominance, HCT emerged as LIS's primary growth vector. These patterns challenge assumptions about field fragmentation, revealing structured diversification shaped by but not determined by organizational positioning.

Unlike disciplines with clearly delineated theoretical frameworks and methodological canons, LIS draws its intellectual foundations from diverse fields including computer science, cognitive psychology, sociology, communication studies, and education [Larivire2012, Zhu2016]. This theoretical and methodological eclecticism is not incidental but constitutive: LIS scholarship evolves in dialogue with and often in response to developments in adjacent disciplines [Cronin2008, Furner2015].\\n\\n\\nThis interdisciplinary character has profound implications for how LIS units are positioned within universities. As the field has evolved, particularly with the rise of digital technologies and data science, LIS schools have increasingly reorganized themselves, forming partnerships with computer science departments, communication schools, education colleges, or positioning themselves as standalone information schools [Wiggins2012, Wu2012]. These structural choices are consequential, influencing faculty recruitment patterns, resource allocation, curriculum development, and ultimately the research agendas pursued by these institutions [Martzoukou2017].\\n\\n\\nYet this same interdisciplinarity that enriches LIS intellectually also creates ambiguity about institutional positioning. From university administrators\\u2019 perspectives, the question \\u201cWhere does LIS belong?\\u201d has no obvious answer [vakkari2024characterizes]. Should information schools align with computer science to emphasize computational methods? Partner with communication to emphasize the social dimensions of information? Affiliate with education to foreground information literacy? Or maintain independence to preserve disciplinary autonomy? These decisions are rarely made on purely intellectual grounds; institutional politics, resource constraints, and historical contingencies all play roles [Dillon2012, Marchionini2008].\\n\\n\\nThe relationship between organizational structure and research direction is unlikely to be unidirectional. While structure may shape research by influencing collaboration networks, hiring priorities, and resource access [Salancik1978, Whitley2000], research interests also drive structural choices as schools position themselves to align with faculty strengths and emerging opportunities [Mintzberg1979]. Previous scholarship has acknowledged this reciprocal relationship in principle but has provided limited empirical evidence about how it manifests in LIS specifically [Ma2012, Wiggins2012]. The result is a gap in our understanding: we lack systematic documentation of whether and how organizational structures and research profiles co-occur in patterned ways across the LIS field.\\n\\n\\nUnderstanding these patterns carries significance for multiple stakeholders. For academic leaders and strategic planners, empirical evidence about how organizational positioning relates to research profiles can inform decisions about restructuring, mergers, or partnership formations [King2017]. For accreditation bodies and professional organizations, these patterns raise questions about whether unified standards make sense when schools pursue such different research agendas [Juznic2003]. For doctoral students and early-career faculty, knowing how organizational structure relates to research environment helps inform program selection and career planning [Sugimoto2011]. For the field broadly, documenting the relationship between institutional diversity and intellectual diversity addresses ongoing debates about LIS identity, coherence, and future viability [Bawden2008, Cronin2005].\\n\\n\\nThis study addresses this gap by providing the first comprehensive empirical mapping of organizational structures and research landscapes in U.S. Library and Information Science schools. Specifically, we investigate three research questions:\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nRQ1: What is the intellectual structure of LIS research in the U.S., and what foundational dimensions define its landscape?\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nRQ2: How does the organizational structure of LIS schools relate to the composition of their research portfolios?\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\n\\nRQ3: How have the research priorities of LIS schools evolved over the past 12 years (2013\\u20132024), and does organizational type influence these evolutionary trajectories?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis study makes three primary contributions. First, we provide comprehensive documentation of how 44 U.S. LIS schools are organized and what research they produce, covering 14,705 publications between 2013 and 2024 published by 1,264 faculty members. Second, we develop a research landscape mapping that identifies 16 distinct research themes and three foundational research dimensions (Library and Knowledge Organization, Human-Centered Technology, and Computing Systems), providing a shared vocabulary for discussing LIS\\u2019s intellectual diversity. Third, we reveal systematic patterns in how organizational structures and research profiles co-occur, that challenge simplistic narratives about the field\\u2019s transformation. It provides an essential empirical foundation for future work and discussion using mixed-method designs to investigate the mechanisms linking structure and scholarship.\\n\\n\", \"2 Literature Review\": \"\\n\\n2 Literature Review\\n\\n\\n2.1 Evolving Identity of LIS\\n\\nThe intellectual core of Library and Information Science has perpetually been defined by its struggle and synergy with interdisciplinarity [Bates1999]. The field\\u2019s theoretical foundation is not a single, stable paradigm but a dynamic and often contentious conversation between imported frameworks and native concepts.\\n\\n\\nTheoretically, LIS has oscillated between embracing its identity as a \\u201cmeta-discipline\\u201d\\u2014a connector of other fields\\u2014and seeking a unique, unifying theory of its own [Cronin2005]. Early anchors in social epistemology and information behavior have been supplemented, and sometimes challenged, by computational and socio-technical theories borrowed from computer science, social informatics, and science and technology studies [Larivire2012]. This has led to a rich but fragmented theoretical landscape where a study on algorithmic bias in search engines and an ethnographic study of a public library\\u2019s community role can sit under the same disciplinary umbrella, speaking different theoretical languages.\\n\\n\\nMethodologically, this theoretical diversity is mirrored by a dramatic expansion from its qualitative, user-study roots. While surveys, interviews, and historical analysis remain vital, the field has undergone a pronounced \\u201ccomputational turn.\\u201d[lou2021temporally] Bibliometrics, once a niche specialty, is now a mainstream methodology. Network analysis, natural language processing, and data mining are increasingly common, pushing LIS research closer to the data sciences[yang2025quantifying]. This methodological borrowing is a double-edged sword: it increases technical rigor and relevance to the digital age but also risks diluting the field\\u2019s distinctive human-centered methodological heritage.\\n\\n\\nIn terms of application and boundaries, LIS has aggressively expanded from its traditional home in libraries and archives [Sugimoto2011]. Its applications now prominently include health informatics, where it contributes to patient data management and consumer health information [chen2024you]; scholarly communication, where it studies the entire research lifecycle from peer review to open science [van2025scholarly]; and social media analysis, where it investigates misinformation and online communities [diaz2019towards]. This boundary-pushing work is the field\\u2019s greatest source of vitality but also its greatest identity crisis. The core question remains: Is LIS defined by its core object of study (\\u201cinformation\\u201d) or by its unique perspective on that object, and if the latter, what precisely is that perspective?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2.2 Organizational Anatomy of LIS Schools\\n\\nThe intellectual tensions within LIS are physically and administratively manifested in the organizational structures of its academic units[Sugimoto2011]. A significant body of internal LIS research has dissected these structures, revealing how they function as engines that shape the field\\u2019s future [Wu2025].\\n\\n\\nA primary focus has been on faculty and research performance. Studies consistently show that an LIS school\\u2019s organizational partnership is a powerful predictor of its research output. Schools partnered with computer science departments tend to publish more in conference proceedings, secure larger grants, and have higher per-faculty publication counts in computationally intensive areas. In contrast, standalone iSchools often boast greater research diversity but may face challenges in achieving critical mass in any one area[bowman2021similarities, wang2025ischools, shah2021ischool]. Faculty hiring patterns are a key mechanism here; a school merging with a communications department will naturally hire faculty with mass media expertise, thereby steering its research agenda toward social media and public opinion[zuo2019standing].\\n\\n\\nAnother critical area of study is curriculum, education, and student outcomes. The syllabus is a direct reflection of organizational identity. Research analyzing course catalogs finds that LIS programs embedded in computer science colleges require more programming and data science courses, while those in education colleges emphasize pedagogy and instructional design. This curricular differentiation directly impacts student pathways [zhang2022creating, weintrop2022ischools]. Graduates from technically-oriented programs are funneled into tech industry roles like UX research and data analytics, while graduates from more traditional or socially-oriented programs more often enter academic, public, or school libraries. This creates a feedback loop where alumni success in a sector reinforces the school\\u2019s strategic focus on it.[huang2025we]\\n\\n\\nFinally, research on leadership, strategy, and accreditation examines the forces that create these structures in the first place. Deans and directors operate under significant pressure, making strategic choices about partnerships to secure resources, enhance prestige, or ensure survival in a competitive university environment [corieri2024ischool, lou2018research]. Accreditation bodies, like the American Library Association, represent another structural force, attempting to uphold core professional competencies across wildly different organizational models\\u2014a tension that raises fundamental questions about whether a unified set of standards can or should apply to such a diverse ecosystem. [bowman2021similarities]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2.3 Institutional Research in LIS\\n\\nThe LIS field has increasingly turned its analytical tools upon itself, generating a multi-layered body of institutional research that documents its own evolution from global to individual scales.\\n\\n\\nAt the macro (global/country) level, bibliometric studies dominate. These large-scale analyses map the field\\u2019s growth, identifying the most prolific nations, the most cited journals, and the rise and fall of major research themes over decades. They reveal, for instance, the ascendancy of China as a major contributor to LIS research and the global shift from \\\"library\\\" to \\\"information\\\" as a central focus. However, these macro-studies often treat \\\"LIS\\\" as a monolith, aggregating data in ways that can conceal the rich organizational diversity underneath. [zheng2025understanding, Rehman2024, Dora2020]\\n\\n\\nAt the meso (institutional/cross-institutional) level, the research becomes sparser. While case studies of individual iSchools or comparative analyses of a handful of programs exist [shah2021ischool, wang2025ischools, Wu2025, Zhu2016, zuo2019standing], there is a significant gap in comprehensive, systematic studies. We lack a clear field-wide understanding of how different organizational models correlate with differentiated research portfolios, faculty demographics, and funding patterns. This level is crucial because it is at the institutional level that strategic decisions are made and intellectual identities are most visibly formed and sustained.[he2025academic]\\n\\n\\nAt the micro (individual/faculty) level, research focuses on the lived experience of the field\\u2019s practitioners. This includes studies of doctoral students\\u2019 dissertation topics, which serve as a leading indicator of the field\\u2019s future direction. It also includes analyses of faculty publishing habits, collaboration networks, and professional identity, exploring how individual scholars navigate the competing demands of interdisciplinary work and departmental expectations [zhu2024dependency]. This level reveals the human impact of the macro trends and meso-level structures, showing how large-scale shifts in the field play out in the daily work and careers of its members [li2022worldwide, wiles2024teaching].\\n\\n\\nIn all, we have a rich understanding of LIS\\u2019s intellectual diversity and a growing, though less systematic, understanding of its organizational diversity . We also have robust theories from higher education studies suggesting these two should be linked [TorresZapata2019]. However, the crucial bridge\\u2014a comprehensive, empirical mapping of how specific organizational structures co-occur with specific research profiles\\u2014remains largely unbuilt. Our study addresses this by uniting these three strands: it uses the methods of macro-level institutional research to conduct a meso-level analysis of organizational types, in order to explain the intellectual identity and diversification of the field.\\n\\n\\n\", \"3 Methods\": \"\\n\\n3 Methods\\n\\nFour major steps compose the workflow of the study (Figure 1), including collecting data of LIS schools, faculty data in the schools over years, publication data of the faculty members from 2013 to 2024, and data analysis pipeline.\\n\\n\\nFigure 1: A workflow of the study, including the data collection and analysis.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1 School Data Collection\\n\\nWe used the list of Best Library and Information Studies Programs from U.S. News and World Report (ranked in 2021) to select schools for this study, in which there are 55 schools. We examine these 55 schools by visiting their website to code their organizational structure. (Step 1 in Figure 1). There are four types of schools that have been excluded from this study. (1) We excluded schools that offer only an LIS degree program without an academic unit of LIS (three schools). These programs may be emerging ones, but most of them do not have full-time faculty for the LIS program. (2) We exclude schools that do not have a school website (one school) or no faculty information online (two schools). (3) We exclude one school that cannot be identified in web archives (Step 2 in Figure 1). 4) We exclude four schools that do not have faculty publication data in Dimension (Step 3 in Figure 1). Eventually, 44 out of 55 schools were included in the study.\\n\\n\\nWe categorized the schools\\u2019 organizational types. We took into account the history of the school to code their organizational type. For example, the LIS school at the University at Albany\\u2013SUNY is currently aligned with Cybersecurity and Homeland Security, but it had been associated with computer science for many years before they formed the new school. Eventually, we identified five major types of academic structures among LIS schools. Table 1 shows a complete list of schools for the five types.\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nInformation: LIS units are standalone and independent, not sharing academic administration with any other discipline.

The most reliable approach involves identifying faculty members from institutional websites and subsequently gathering their publications by name, which presents a significant methodological challenge. Given that faculty recruitment patterns may reflect shifts in institutional research priorities, we employed the Internet Archive\\u2019s Wayback Machine to capture faculty information at multiple temporal points. We collected faculty data annually to characterize institutional research focus changes over three-year periods. For instance, faculty information from 2014 was used to identify publications from 2013, 2014, and 2015. Consequently, we gathered faculty data from 2014, 2017, 2020, and 2023 to cover publications spanning 2012 to 2024 (see Step 2 in Figure 1). For each institution at each data collection point, we began by searching the current faculty directory URL in the Wayback Machine and extracted faculty information from archived website snapshots. We utilized Python scripts to collect snapshot URLs for faculty data extraction. However, many directory page URLs had changed over time, requiring manual identification of the correct archived faculty directory pages. We employed institutional website URLs in the Wayback Machine to locate faculty directory page snapshots. When institutional websites had undergone structural changes, we navigated back to university-level snapshots to identify the appropriate school-level archives. In rare instances where university website URLs had changed completely, we utilized search engines to identify historical university website URLs. Through this systematic approach, we successfully collected archived snapshots of all LIS school faculty directory pages in 2014, 2017, 2020, and 2023. The snapshot URLs follow the standard Internet Archive format: \\u201chttps://web.archive.org/web/{timestamp}/{directory_page_URL}\\u201d.\\n\\n\\nAll faculty names were collected with the assistance of browser-use\\u2019s AI feature.\\nA standardized prompt was issued for each directory page to extract faculty information (see prompt in the Appendix).\\nWe manually validated all extracted records and consolidated them into a single table.\\nWe examined the data for abnormalities, such as implausible faculty entries in a given year or dramatic year-over-year changes.\\nAlthough some turnover is expected, substantial shifts are uncommon.\\nWhen anomalies were detected, we repeated data collection for that year manually.\\nAfter establishing broad consistency across years, we randomly selected one of the four collection points for detailed manual verification of accuracy.\\nIn total, we compiled 3,379 faculty records across the four collection points (745 in 2014, 823 in 2017, 805 in 2020, 1,006 in 2023), including tenure-track, tenured, and non-tenure-track full-time faculty, while excluding adjunct professors, visiting professors, and graduate students.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3 Publication Data Collection\\n\\nNext, we collected the publications of all faculty members (Step 3 in Figure 1).\\nWe used the Dimensions Analytics API (DSL v2) because it provides broad coverage of journals and conferences and supports author disambiguation.\\nBy merging faculty records across years by name and organization, we obtained 1,683 unique faculty records.\\nFor each faculty member, we first issued an exact-name query constrained by institutional affiliation: search researchers where first_name = \\\"{firstname}\\\" and last_name = \\\"{lastname}\\\" and research_orgs.id = \\\"{grid_id}\\\" return researchers, where {grid_id} is the GRID identifier of the faculty member\\u2019s university.\\nIf the exact query returned no result, we relaxed the first-name constraint to a fuzzy match using first_name \\u223c\\\\sim \\\"{firstname}\\\" while keeping the affiliation filter.\\nWhen multiple researcher records were returned for a faculty member, we retrieved recent publications for each candidate and manually identified those working in Library and Information Science or closely related areas.\\nUsing this procedure, 1,264 of 1,683 faculty were matched by name and organization.\\nOf these, 31 were manually disambiguated across multiple returned profiles.\\n\\n\\nWith the researcher IDs, we collected 23,001 publications for the 1,264 faculty members.\\nAmong these, 19,726 were unique publications.\\nWe queried publications using search publications where researchers = \\\"{dimension_id}\\\" return publications.\\nWe retained only records with Document Type in \\u2019RESEARCH_ARTICLE\\u2019, \\u2019CONFERENCE_PAPER\\u2019, \\u2019RESEARCH_CHAPTER\\u2019, \\u2019REVIEW_ARTICLE\\u2019, yielding 16,761 articles.\\nWe detected duplicate entries across preprint and published versions and removed them.\\nThe final deduplicated set contained 14,740 unique publications.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4 Research Theme Modeling and Visualization\\n\\nTo identify and analyze research themes in the field of Library and Information Science (LIS), we employed a state-of-the-art topic modeling approach that leverages transformer-based language models. Specifically, we used BERTopic [grootendorst2022bertopic], which combines the power of BERT-based text embeddings with clustering techniques to discover coherent and interpretable research themes from academic publications. Although BERTopic labels its clusters \\u201ctopics\\u201d, we refer to them as \\u201cresearch themes\\u201d because their granularity is closer to that of domain-level areas in LIS.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4.1 Embedding Generation\\n\\nWe extracted semantic representations from the titles and abstracts of all 14,705 publications using the SPECTER2 model [singh2023scirepeval], which is specifically designed for scholarly document representation. This model captures semantic relationships between academic papers more effectively than general-purpose language models. For each paper, we concatenated the title and abstract text with the SPECTER2 separation token and generated a 768-dimensional embedding vector that encodes the semantic content of the paper.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4.2 Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering\\n\\nThe high-dimensional embeddings were then processed through a multi-step pipeline for identifying research themes:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nDimensionality Reduction: We applied UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) to reduce the embeddings to 10 dimensions while preserving the semantic relationships between papers. This step facilitates more efficient clustering and visualization.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nHierarchical Clustering: We utilized Agglomerative Clustering to group the publications into 16 coherent research themes. This approach was selected after experimentation with HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), as it provided more balanced and interpretable theme clusters for our dataset. We experimented with different number of themes from 10 to 20. We use two basic rules to huristically determine the number of themes. First, the number of themes should be enough to cover all the major research themes without merging major themes into one theme, for example, \\\"Library Science\\\" and \\\"Metadata and Archives\\\" are two major related themes, but they should not be merged into one theme. Second, the themes should not be too similar to each other that can be merged into one theme. We found 16 themes is a good balance between these two rules.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\n\\nTheme Representation: To generate interpretable representations of each theme, we employed a Class-based TF-IDF (c-TF-IDF) transformation combined with Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) to extract distinctive keywords while ensuring diversity in the theme representations.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.\\n\\nTheme Labeling and Refinement\\nThe initial model identified 16 themes. After examining the themes, two small non-LIS topics were identified: \\u201cQuantum Communication\\u201d and \\u201cAtmospheric Chemistry\\u201d.\\nAlthough these topics included publications by LIS-affiliated faculty, they were not central to LIS research and involved only a few authors from LIS schools. We excluded 35 publications from these topics.\\nThe final dataset contained 14,705 publications. The final model contained 14 distinct research themes. For improved interpretability, we enhanced the theme labels using a GPT-4o based system. For each theme, we provided the model with a sample of 500 publication titles and requested concise, descriptive labels along with subtopics and a brief summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4.3 Visualization\\n\\nWe created several visualizations to facilitate the exploration and understanding of the LIS research landscape:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nResearch Landscape Map: Using UMAP, we reduced the embeddings to 2 dimensions for visualization purposes. Each point in the resulting map (Figure 2) represents a publication, colored according to its assigned theme. The size of each point corresponds to its citation count. The landscape map provides an intuitive overview of the proximity and boundaries between different research areas in LIS.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nTheme Distribution by School Type: To analyze the relationship between organizational structure and research focus, we created visualizations showing the distribution of research themes across different types of LIS schools (Figure 4).\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\n\\nUniversity Positioning: We mapped individual universities in the research landscape based on the aggregated embeddings of their faculty publications (Figure 5) by using principal component analysis (PCA), revealing institutional specializations and positioning within the broader LIS research ecosystem.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.\\n\\nTrend Analysis: To visualize the evolution of institutional research profiles, we aggregated the 16 research themes into three foundational dimensions (see Section 4.2). For each university, we calculated the annual proportion of publications in each dimension from 2013 to 2024. We restricted this analysis to 37 schools that met the criteria of having at least 50 publications and data spanning at least 5 years. To identify robust long-term trends amidst year-to-year volatility, we applied linear regression to these annual proportions for each dimension. We then used the regression models to predict the composition of research for the start year (2013) and end year (2024). These predicted start and end points were mapped onto a ternary coordinate system, with arrows connecting the 2013 position to the 2024 position to visualize the magnitude and direction of the shift. This approach allows for a clear depiction of how schools are repositioning themselves within the triangular conceptual space defined by the field\\u2019s three pillars. To categorize these evolutionary trajectories, we analyzed the change in the proportional share of each dimension (LKO, HCT, CS) between the predicted 2013 and 2024 coordinates. We defined a significance threshold of 5 percentage points based on a heuristic evaluation. This threshold provides a robust margin to distinguish meaningful strategic shifts from noise or minor fluctuations. Additionally, sensitivity testing indicated that this cutoff effectively captures the primary evolutionary trends, yielding a reasonable number of significant moves across the dataset without over-interpreting marginal changes. For each dimension, a university was classified as moving \\u201cToward\\u201d that dimension if its share increased by \\u22655%\\\\geq 5\\\\%, and \\u201cAway from\\u201d it if its share decreased by \\u22655%\\\\geq 5\\\\%. A university\\u2019s trajectory could be assigned multiple directional labels (e.g., matching both \\u201cAway from LKO\\u201d and \\u201cToward HCT\\u201d).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe resulting topic model and visualizations provide a comprehensive view of the current LIS research landscape in the United States, enabling analysis of how different organizational structures correlate with research themes and temporal evolution.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.5 Statistical Analysis\\n\\nTo statistically evaluate differences in research topic composition across the five organizational school types, we employed Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA).\\nThe topic distribution data (the proportion of publications in each research theme for each university) differs from standard Euclidean space data due to its compositional nature (proportions sum to 1). To address this, we applied the Centered Log-Ratio (CLR) transformation to the topic proportions.\\nAitchison distance (Euclidean distance on CLR-transformed data) was then calculated between all pairs of universities to form a distance matrix.\\nWe performed a global PERMANOVA test to assess whether significant overall differences existed among the groups.\\nFollowing a significant global result, we conducted pairwise PERMANOVA comparisons between all school type pairs.\\nWe employed Fisher\\u2019s Protected Least Significant Difference (LSD) procedure for pairwise comparisons to balance Type I and Type II error rates.\\n\\n\\n\", \"4 Results\": \"\\n\\n4 Results\\n\\n\\n4.1 Faculty and Publication Data\\n\\nAs shown in Table 2, faculty size varies substantially by organizational type.\\nComputer units have the largest faculties on average (mean 39.2; median 36.0).\\nInformation units are next (mean 28.2; median 22.0), followed by Communication (mean 18.3; median 20.0) and Education (mean 12.6; median 11.0).\\nArt&Science units are the smallest (mean 10.6; median 9.0).\\n\\n\\nPublication output also differs greatly across school types.\\nComputer exhibits the highest per-faculty productivity (mean 25.9; median 16.0; std 28.3).\\nInformation has the greatest total output (sum 8,837) with moderate per-faculty rates (mean 15.7; median 8.0; std 18.0).\\nCommunication shows mid-range rates (mean 14.2; median 9.0; std 15.8).\\nArt&Science and Education display lower per-faculty publication rates (means 10.6 and 10.9, respectively).\\n\\n\\nTable 2: Publications and Faculty Statistics by Academic Structure Type\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPublications (per faculty)\\nFaculty (per unit)\\n\\n\\nType\\nSum\\nMean\\nMedian\\nStd\\nSum\\nMean\\nMedian\\nStd\\n\\n\\nArt&Science\\n564\\n10.6\\n6.0\\n10.2\\n53\\n10.6\\n9.0\\n3.7\\n\\n\\nCommunication\\n1820\\n14.2\\n9.0\\n15.8\\n128\\n18.3\\n20.0\\n5.9\\n\\n\\nComputer\\n5068\\n25.9\\n16.0\\n28.3\\n196\\n39.2\\n36.0\\n19.2\\n\\n\\nEducation\\n957\\n10.9\\n6.0\\n11.8\\n88\\n12.6\\n11.0\\n6.9\\n\\n\\nInformation\\n8837\\n15.7\\n8.0\\n18.0\\n563\\n28.2\\n22.0\\n19.2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.2 Research Themes\\n\\nTo address RQ1 regarding the intellectual structure and foundational dimensions of the field, we first analyze the research themes emerging from publications. Our theme modeling analysis of 14,705 LIS faculty publications between 2013 and 2024 reveals the interdisciplinary nature of Library and Information Science research in the United States. The model identified 16 distinct research themes as shown in Table 3 and Figure 2. The table shows the label, count, and representation of each theme. The labels were generated by the GPT-4o using the publication title in each theme and adjusted by the authors. The representation is a list of keywords that are most representative of the theme detected by the c-TF-IDF algorithm. The subtopics of each research theme were identified by the GPT-4.1 based system. The count is the number of publications in the theme. The research landscape map (Figure 2) shows the distribution of publications in the 16 themes encoded by different colors. The landscape map provides an intuitive overview of the proximity and boundaries between different research themes in LIS.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: Research landscape of Library and Information Science in the United States from 2013 to 2024. Each point is a publication positioned by semantic similarity. Colors denote the 16 research themes; dense regions and larger labels mark higher volume.

Total publication output increased steadily over this period with a normalized annual growth rate of n=4.8%n{=}4.8\\\\%, rising from approximately 937 publications in 2013 to around 1,500 in 2024. Human-centered Technology is the fastest-growing research group (n=6.7%n{=}6.7\\\\%), followed by Computing Systems (n=4.5%n{=}4.5\\\\%) and Library and Knowledge Organization (n=1.5%n{=}1.5\\\\%).\\nThe fastest-growing research areas demonstrate expansion: Extended Reality leads with n=13.1%n{=}13.1\\\\% growth, followed by Digital Privacy and Well-Being (n=9.9%n{=}9.9\\\\%), Health Information Behavior (n=9.6%n{=}9.6\\\\%), AI and Data Science (n=9.4%n{=}9.4\\\\%), and Computing Education (n=8.7%n{=}8.7\\\\%).\\nThese emerging areas show clear upward trajectories.\\nStrong but more moderate growth characterizes Social Media (n=7.7%n{=}7.7\\\\%), Autonomous Systems (n=6.8%n{=}6.8\\\\%), while Health Informatics and Technology (n=4.9%n{=}4.9\\\\%), Biomedical Informatics (n=4.6%n{=}4.6\\\\%) continue steady expansion.

This visualization reveals how organizational positioning influences research focus, with clear specialization patterns emerging across different school types.\\n\\n\\nEducation schools demonstrate the strongest commitment to traditional library-oriented research, with Library Science constituting 30.8% of their publications.\\nMetadata and Archives represent another substantial focus area at 19.8%, reinforcing their dedication to information organization and preservation.\\nThese schools also devote considerable attention to Computing Education (8.6%), indicating the education-oriented research focus of the Education schools.\\n\\n\\nComputer schools present the most technically oriented research profile among all organizational types.\\nTheir focus on Biomedical Informatics (15.9%) and Privacy and Security (10.1%) significantly exceeds the LIS-wide averages, reflecting deep engagement with computational methods and data-intensive research domains.\\nNotably, Library Science accounts for merely 2.7% of their research output, representing the lowest proportion among all structural types and a fundamental shift toward technology-driven research.\\n\\n\\nCommunication schools maintain a more balanced research agenda that bridges traditional and emerging information concerns.\\nLibrary Science remains prominent at 26.8%, while Metadata and Archives (8.3%), Social Media research (8.0%), and Information Access and Equity (7.5%) constitute additional focal areas.\\nThis distribution suggests a research orientation that encompasses both institutional information practices and social dimensions of information phenomena.\\n\\n\\nArt&Science schools display similar research emphases as Communication schools. They demonstrate engagement with both traditional information science concerns and data-intensive research domains.\\nLibrary Science comprises 23.8% of their work, while Information Retrieval (13.1%) and Health Information Behavior (12.1%) feature prominently.\\n\\n\\nIndependent Information schools exhibit the most diversified research portfolio, with no single theme dominating their scholarly output.\\nTheir research spans multiple domains relatively evenly, though AI and Data Science (10.6%) emerges as areas of particular concentration.\\nThis balanced distribution suggests that Information schools cultivate broad interdisciplinary connections. Worth noting is that since the majority of the schools are Information schools, it is not surprising they present more diverse research profiles.\\n\\n\\nThe visual comparison across organizational types in Figure 4 reveals how structural positioning fundamentally shapes research agendas.\\nComputer schools clearly drive technical specializations, Education schools sustain traditional library science while incorporating education technologies, and Communication and Art&Science schools foster research on information behavior and social media.\\n\\n\\nTo statistically validate these observed differences, we performed a PERMANOVA using Aitchison distance. The global test revealed a statistically significant difference in research topic composition across the five school types (pseudo-F=1.77F=1.77, p=0.002p=0.002). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons using Fisher\\u2019s Protected LSD indicated that Computer Science-affiliated schools differ significantly from Education (p=0.001p=0.001), Information (p=0.003p=0.003), Communication (p=0.008p=0.008), and Art & Science (p=0.037p=0.037) schools. Additionally, Information schools significantly differ from Education schools (p=0.036p=0.036). Other pairwise comparisons were not statistically significant (p>0.05p>0.05). These results confirm that the \\u201cComputer\\u201d affiliation marks a distinct departure in research identity, while subtle differences also exist between other types of schools.\\n\\n\\nThese patterns observed from the visualization along with the statistical evidence demonstrate that organizational structure serves not merely as an administrative arrangement but as a powerful force shaping the intellectual direction of LIS scholarship.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3.2 Individual School Positioning\\n\\nSince schools of the same type may exhibit substantial variation, we further examine each university\\u2019s research positioning by analyzing the similarity between its publications and those of other institutions.\\nThe university positioning visualization (Figure 5) illustrates how individual institutions situate themselves within the broader research landscape through principal component analysis (PCA).\\nWe employ PCA because its linear nature enables meaningful comparisons of proximity across institutions.\\nThe visualization reveals several notable patterns in the research landscape.\\n\\n\\nFigure 5: Positioning of LIS schools in the research landscape. Each node represents a university, with node color indicating academic structure type. Proximity between institutions reflects similarity in research profiles, revealing clusters of schools with shared research emphases.\\n\\n\\nFirst, Computer schools (shown in green) form a distinct cluster on the right side of the plot, indicating their shared emphasis on computational and technical research areas.\\nSecond, Information schools (shown in blue) form the largest and most dispersed cluster, which reflects their diverse research portfolios spanning both traditional and emerging information science topics.\\nThird, schools from different organizational types cluster together too, suggesting that research focus can transcend structural boundaries. For instance, several Education schools position near Communication schools.\\nFourth, considerable within-type variation exists, demonstrating that organizational structure alone does not determine research direction. For example, University of California\\u2013Los Angeles and Long Island University Post are both Education schools but they are located in different parts of the plot. These patterns reveal that while organizational structure influences research priorities, other factors such as individual institutional cultures, faculty expertise, and strategic choices may also play important roles in shaping research identities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.4 Temporal Evolution and Bidirectional Movement\\n\\nFinally, to answer RQ3 about the evolution of research priorities and the influence of organizational type, we trace the trajectories of schools and school types over the 12-year period.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.4.1 Directional Shifts\\n\\nFigure 6 presents the aggregate temporal evolution (linear regression with 95% confidence interval) of research priorities across the five organizational types of LIS schools. Each arrow represents a school type\\u2019s collective trajectory within the research landscape defined by the three foundational dimensions. Computer schools exhibit a clear shift toward HCT and away from CS research, with slight movement away from LKO and relatively low uncertainty in their trajectories. Information schools also moved toward HCT and CS while retreating from LKO. Communication and Art&Science schools follow similar trajectories to Information schools, though Art&Science schools demonstrate stronger movement toward CS. Education schools display a unique evolutionary pattern, moving toward LKO and CS while shifting away from HCT. While these aggregate patterns reveal meaningful differences across organizational types, substantial heterogeneity exists within each category. Thus, we also examined individual school trajectories.\\n\\n\\nFigure 6: Temporal evolution of research priorities for five types of LIS schools from 2013 to 2024 using ternary plots. Each arrow represents an institution\\u2019s trajectory within the research landscape defined by three foundational dimensions. The band shows 95% confidence interval. The three vertices of each triangle represent 100% concentration in HCT, LKO, and CS, respectively.\\n\\n\\nSimilarly, Figure 7 visualizes the temporal evolution of research priorities for 37 LIS schools from 2013 to 2024 using ternary plots. Each arrow represents a school\\u2019s trajectory within the research landscape defined by three foundational dimensions. The percentage changes in research dimension shares of the schools can be found in Appendix.\\n\\n\\nFigure 7: Ternary plots depicting the directional shifts of LIS schools across three research dimensions from 2013 to 2024. Each of the six panels represents schools exhibiting a specific movement pattern. Each school is represented by an arrow connecting its starting position to its ending position, with colors indicating organizational structure type.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe most profound shift is a migration away from LKO. Panel a2 (Moving Away from LKO) captures the largest grouping, comprising 21 schools (56.8% of the sample) that reduced their relative focus on LKO. This migration spans all organizational types, with arrows originating near the LKO vertex and extending toward the HCT-CS axis, confirming the narrative of a fundamental transition in LIS research. However, the data challenges the assumption of a unidirectional drift. Panel a1 (Moving Toward LKO) reveals a counter-trend, where 14 schools increased their relative focus on LKO. Many of these institutions, already heavily invested in HCT and CS, appear to be re-balancing their portfolios by renewing their engagement with traditional library and information science foundations.\\nPanel b1 (Moving Toward HCT) highlights another primary trend: 19 schools shifting their portfolios toward Human-Centered Technology. This group largely overlaps with those moving away from LKO (Panel a2). Notably, many arrows in this panel are long and terminate near the HCT vertex, suggesting a radical transformation toward HCT rather than a subtle adjustment.\\n\\n\\nPanel c1 (Moving Toward CS) shows a smaller but significant cluster of 14 schools deepening their engagement with CS. Conversely, Panel c2 (Moving Away from CS) shows 11 schools retreating from CS research. These counter-movements are particularly visible among Computer-affiliated schools and schools with heavy investments in CS, which were among the most CS-focused in 2013. This suggests that even computationally intensive schools are seeking more balanced research portfolios.\\n\\n\\nIn summary, the evolution of LIS research is characterized not by a uniform technological drift, but by a complex dynamic of diversification and strategic re-balancing between human-centered, computational, and traditional information priorities. However, it is unclear the strategy of schools moving away and toward different dimensions. Thus, we analyze the pattern combinations of directional shifts to better understand the strategies in the next section.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.4.2 Pattern Combinations\\n\\nAnalysis of how directional movements combine reveals that LIS schools are following diverse evolutionary strategies (Figure 8). The most common pattern is moving Away from LKO. The pattern combined with Toward HCT (16 schools, 43.2%) and Toward CS (10 schools, 27.0%) form the most common evolutionary strategies in LIS. Within this broad trend of distancing from traditional foundations (LKO), a subgroup of 5 schools (13.5%) pursues a \\u201cDual-Diversification\\u201d strategy, simultaneously moving Away from LKO while expanding into both HCT and CS.\\n\\n\\nFigure 8: UpSet plot showing the distribution of schools across different research trend patterns within the three research dimensions.\\nThe horizontal bar chart (left) displays the size of each trend category, while the vertical bar chart (top) shows the composition of intersections by school types.\\nThe dot matrix (bottom right) indicates which trend patterns are combined in each intersection, with connected dots representing combinations.\\nTrend categories include movements toward or away from LKO, HCT, and CS.\\n\\n\\nIn contrast, two other primary evolutionary strategies involve a renewed emphasis on LKO: Away from CS + Toward LKO and Away from HCT + Toward LKO (both 8 schools, 21.6%). These patterns represent distinct pathways for schools re-engaging with LKO. Other salient strategies include Away from HCT + Toward CS (6 schools, 16.2%) and Away from CS + Toward HCT (5 schools, 13.5%). These disparate trajectories underscore that LIS schools are not undergoing a uniform transformation, but rather differentiating into specialized profiles through targeted strategic shifts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"5 Discussion\": \"\\n\\n5 Discussion\\n\\nThe Diversification of LIS and the Question of Disciplinary Coherence\\n\\nOur finding that LIS schools pursue concentrated yet divergent evolutionary strategies speaks directly to longstanding debates about disciplinary coherence and fragmentation [Bawden2008, Cronin2005]. Previous scholarship has expressed concern that LIS risks developing into disconnected subfields as schools pursue computational, social, or traditional library-focused research without shared intellectual foundations [Furner2015]. Our evidence suggests a more nuanced reality: while schools do specialize along distinct dimensions, they do so through systematic patterns rather than chaotic fragmentation. The bifurcation between Human-Centered Technology and Computing Systems pathways among schools leaving traditional LIS may reflect what [whitley2000intellectual] described as the \\u201corganizational fragmentation\\u201d typical of fields with high task uncertainty and low mutual dependence [vakkari2024characterizes, astrom2008formalizing]\\u2014multiple viable approaches exist to studying information phenomena, and schools choose based on resource dependencies and institutional contexts rather than a single disciplinary logic.\\n\\n\\nHowever, the persistence of Library and Knowledge Organization research across all organizational types, combined with the substantial \\u201creturn to foundations\\u201d pattern, challenges declinate narratives. This pattern aligns with [lou2021temporally] observation that information organization remains conceptually central even as methods evolve. The question is not whether LIS will survive computational transformation, but rather how effectively the field integrates new capabilities while preserving distinctive expertise that other disciplines cannot easily replicate.\\n\\n\\n\\nOrganizational Embeddedness and Research Autonomy\\n\\nThe asymmetric clustering patterns we observed\\u2014particularly the tight convergence of Computer schools versus the dispersion of independent Information schools\\u2014can be understood through resource dependence theory [Salancik1978]. Schools partnering with powerful disciplines like computer science gain access to infrastructure, funding networks, and legitimacy, but these benefits come with constraints on research autonomy. Our finding that Computer schools cluster tightly in computationally-intensive research space suggests that resource dependencies shape not just what research is feasible, but what research becomes normative within those institutional contexts.\\n\\n\\nYet resource dependence alone cannot explain our temporal findings. The observation that over half of Computer schools moved away from pure Computing Systems research (while maintaining computational orientation in other dimensions) suggests schools exercise agency in navigating structural constraints. This aligns with recent organizational scholarship emphasizing that embedded actors can strategically decouple from institutional pressures [glaser2018changing]. Computer schools may satisfy Computer Science partnership expectations through faculty hiring and infrastructure sharing while carving out distinctive research niches in computational social science or health informatics that differentiate them from generic Computer Science departments.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Human-Centered Technology Ascendancy\\n\\nPerhaps our most striking finding is that Human-Centered Technology, not Computing Systems, emerged as LIS\\u2019s dominant growth vector. This pattern contradicts conventional wisdom equating \\u201cdata science\\u201d with computational methods broadly, and challenges assumptions that LIS schools must compete with Computer Science departments on systems research to remain relevant. We propose three complementary explanations for HCT\\u2019s prominence. First, path dependence: LIS\\u2019s historical emphasis on user-centered librarianship and information behavior research provides intellectual and methodological foundations that translate more readily into human-computer interaction, social computing, and digital privacy research than into algorithms or systems architecture. Schools building on existing strengths may achieve higher quality output than those attempting to compete in areas where they lack comparative advantage. Second, labor market differentiation: As Computer Science departments flood markets with systems-oriented graduates, LIS programs may find better placement outcomes by preparing graduates who combine technical competence with deep understanding of human information needs\\u2014a skill combination Computer Science programs rarely emphasize. Student demand follows employment opportunities, creating feedback loops that reinforce HCT investment. Third, funding landscape evolution: Major funding agencies increasingly prioritize \\u201csocially-relevant computing\\u201d and \\u201chuman-AI interaction\\u201d over pure systems research (NSF\\u2019s focus on \\u201cAI for Social Good\\u201d, NIH\\u2019s emphasis on human-centered health IT) [tomavsev2020ai, NIH2025]. LIS schools may be responding rationally to these incentive structures.\\n\\n\\n\\nImplications for LIS Education and Accreditation\\n\\nOur findings raise challenges for accreditation bodies and professional organizations assuming uniform standards across organizationally diverse schools. If Computer schools produce 25.9 publications per faculty member focused heavily on computational methods while Education schools produce 10.9 publications per faculty emphasizing information literacy and pedagogy, can a single set of accreditation standards meaningfully assess both? Current ALA accreditation focuses on professional competencies rather than research profiles, but faculty expertise necessarily shapes what students learn.[salaba202321st]\\nThe field faces a choice: embrace organizational diversity by developing multiple accreditation pathways recognizing different institutional missions, or insist on core competencies that all graduates must demonstrate regardless of school type. The former risks fragmentation and loss of professional identity; the latter may impose unrealistic expectations on schools with limited resources.\\n\\n\\n\\nLimitations and Future Directions\\n\\nOur descriptive analysis documents co-occurrence patterns but cannot establish whether organizational structure shapes research, research drives structural choices, or both co-evolve. Our U.S.-focused sample may not generalize internationally, and publication-based measures exclude teaching, service, and professional impact. Future research should examine mechanisms linking structure to research: Do Computer Science partnerships influence outcomes through hiring, infrastructure, or disciplinary norms? Do different structures produce graduates with distinct competencies and career outcomes? Longitudinal case studies of reorganization events could provide causal insights our cross-sectional approach cannot.\\n\\n\\n\", \"6 Conclusion\": \"\\n\\n6 Conclusion\\n\\nThis study provides the first comprehensive empirical mapping of how organizational structures and research portfolios co-occur across U.S. Library and Information Science schools. By analyzing 14,705 publications from 1,264 faculty members across 44 institutions, we have established a research landscape framework organized around three foundational dimensions that offers a shared vocabulary for understanding LIS\\u2019s intellectual diversity. Our findings reveal that organizational positioning shapes but does not determine research trajectories: Computer schools cluster tightly in computationally-intensive research, yet most are pivoting toward Human-Centered Technology and Library and Knowledge Organization; independent Information schools demonstrate the greatest portfolio diversity; and Education schools uniquely maintain engagement with traditional library science foundations. Most significantly, the temporal analysis reveals that LIS schools pursue a small number of coherent strategic pathways, with Human-Centered Technology instead of Computing Systems emerging as the field\\u2019s primary growth vector. The intellectual diversity documented here may represent adaptive capacity rather than fragmentation, positioning different schools to serve distinct research profiles and to respond to varied institutional demands. The question facing LIS is whether this diversity will be deliberately cultivated as a source of collective strength or whether competitive pressures will force convergence.\\n\\n\", \"7 Data Availability Statement\": \"\\n\\n7 Data Availability Statement\\n\\nThe faculty data can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18396782.

These mobile robotic systems are increasingly utilized in diverse domains such as agriculture, logistics, surveillance, environmental monitoring, and search and rescue operations. As these robots operate in complex, dynamic, and often unpredictable environments, there is a growing need to enhance their autonomy to perform tasks with higher accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability.\\n\\n\\nOne of the critical factors in achieving greater autonomy in mobile robotic systems is the effective use of knowledge. Mobile robots require comprehensive and precise knowledge about their environment, tasks, actions, and inherent capabilities to make informed decisions and execute tasks successfully across different contexts. Traditionally, this knowledge has been encoded in algorithms and static databases, which often lack the flexibility and scalability needed to handle the dynamic nature of real-world scenarios.\\n\\n\\nTo address these limitations, the concept of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) has emerged as a powerful tool for knowledge representation and reasoning. KGs provide a structured and semantically rich framework for organizing information, enabling both the representation of complex relationships and efficient algorithms for knowledge retrieval and reasoning. Integrating KGs into mobile robot systems can enhance their capability to perform these tasks autonomously by providing real-time situational awareness, contextual understanding, and decision support.\\n\\n\\nDespite these advantages, the development and implementation of KGs in mobile robotic systems present several challenges, including data integration from various sensors and sources, real-time knowledge updating, or multi-agent interaction.\\n\\n\\nThis paper aims to develop a comprehensive methodology for applying KG to existing ROS 2 based robotic systems using a \\u201dbrownfield\\u201d approach.

Various approaches have been explored in this domain, each one leveraging distinct methodologies and technologies to improve robotic autonomy and efficiency. This section delves into the diverse landscape of mobile robotic systems incorporating knowledge-based systems, highlighting key innovations, methodologies, and their respective contributions to the field.\\n\\n\\nCognitive architectures are comprehensive, computational frameworks designed to model the structures and processes of human cognition. These architectures serve as blueprints for understanding and replicating the intricacies of human thought, encompassing perception, memory, reasoning, and learning. They provide a unified platform for developing intelligent agents capable of performing complex tasks, offering significant advancements in fields ranging from robotics to human-computer interaction.\\n\\n\\nSOAR [4], was the first cognitive architecture integrated into real robots and used with multiple robots [1]. Its basic architecture is established by representing the state of an environment through a graph composed of discrete objects and continuous properties. This allows for a set of predicates to be independent and fixed within the architecture, while the decisions regarding which predicates should be extracted are determined by the specific task that an agent must perform [5].\\n\\n\\nACT-R [8] models human cognition by integrating symbolic and subsymbolic processing. Symbolic processing includes declarative memory, which stores knowledge as chunks (data and facts) with labels (slots), and procedural memory, which holds production rules in \\u201dif-then\\u201d statements to guide behavior based on current goals. Subsymbolic processing operates using a connectionist model, resolving conflicts by selecting the chunk with the highest activation level, determined by past utility and context relevance. Through cycles of perception, cognition, and action, ACT-R adapts to changing environments and tasks, effectively storing and managing knowledge.\\n\\n\\nLIDA [3], provides adaptation and continuous learning by utilizing a multilayer working memory system. Each layer within this system has a distinct purpose and stores various types of information: perceptual, declarative, memory, and procedural. Active working memory serves as the interface that connects all these layers, allowing for the manipulation of stored information. LIDA employs a distributed representation where information is encoded through the activation patterns of artificial neural networks, offering a robust mechanism for adapting to dynamic environments.\\n\\n\\nAside from cognitive architectures, other systems focus more specifically on concrete knowledge representation methods. These methods, used in modern advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and neural networks, often emphasize structured data storage, pattern recognition, and internal learned representations.\\n\\n\\nThe proposed ontology structure by [9] comprises three hierarchical layers where each layer regards more specific knowledge than the former: a metaontology that represents generic concepts, an ontology schema defining domain-specific knowledge, and an ontology instance that captures specific information about individual objects and their attributes. These layers are organized into six classes: Feature, Object, Actor, Space, Context, and Action, each with varying levels of detail. This structure provides a comprehensive, object-oriented, and frame-based language while the hierarchical structure that allows for knowledge to be effectively used through reasoning.\\n\\n\\nThe system proposed in [6] utilizes a knowledge-based system that integrates explicit expert knowledge with implicit learned knowledge, allowing the system to update its model based on the acquired information continuously. Through a knowledge acquisition module explicit knowledge provided by the operator is captured and converted into machine-readable form and then integrated with implicit knowledge. Implicit knowledge is captured by training a model to imitate the adjustments made by the operator, ultimately leading to full automation of robot programming. By learning from the operator\\u2019s adjustments, the system enhances its flexibility, adaptability, and performance, addressing the challenges of industrial robot programming and improving overall efficiency in production processes.\\n\\n\\nKnowledge Graphs (KG) were first introduced in [10] and later popularized by Google, and have evolved significantly, becoming powerful tools for structuring and managing complex relationships between data in various fields, including autonomous systems and robotics. In [7], authors discuss the use of KGs in enhancing robot manipulation tasks. They introduce a multi-layer knowledge-representation model that incorporates various elements such as scenes, objects, agents, tasks, actions, and skills. This hierarchical structure allows for a more nuanced understanding of manipulation tasks compared to traditional flat representations. The authors propose a heterogeneous graph-embedding method that assigns different weights to various relations within the KG to enhance reasoning capabilities. This approach allows the system to differentiate the significance of different connections, facilitating more nuanced reasoning about how various factors influence manipulation tasks.\\n\\n\\nCompared to traditional cognitive architectures, KGs offer a more flexible and scalable approach to representing information. While cognitive architectures are highly specialized in replicating human-like reasoning and learning, they are limited in adaptability across various tasks or domains. KGs, in contrast, provide a dynamic, interconnected representation of entities and their relationships, allowing for more granular, real-time information querying and updating.\\n\\n\\n\", \"II METHODOLOGY\": \"\\n\\nII METHODOLOGY\\n\\n\\nFigure 1: A full overview of the described methodology. Circles represent each step described in the proposed methodology while rectangular boxes contain the outcomes of each step.\\n\\n\\nThe proposed methodology\\u2019s objective is to integrate KGs into ROS 2 systems providing a structured approach for leveraging the full potential of KGs, thus enabling more informed decision-making and improved mission performance in diverse ROS 2 based applications. This methodology is composed of several key steps: defining initial and target conditions, structuring tasks and sub-tasks, planning their sequence, representing task-related data in a KG, and designing the mission using a high-level language. Each step builds on the previous one, ensuring a cohesive process from initial setup to final execution. A full overview of the methodology is shown in Figure 1.\\n\\n\\n\\nII-A Definition\\n\\n\\nIn the definition step, initial conditions of the mission and expected outcomes are defined. This foundational step involves a thorough understanding of the mission\\u2019s goals and constraints, providing a clear vision of the desired outcomes. This step aims to establish a baseline against which the subsequent steps will be measured, ensuring that all efforts align with the ultimate mission objectives.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII-B Structuring\\n\\n\\nThe structuring step involves breaking down the mission into a detailed list of tasks necessary to achieve the defined target conditions. Each task is further subdivided into sub-tasks, with a focus on identifying and specifying the inputs and outputs associated with each sub-task, helping to understand essential activities, their interconnections, and decision points necessary for mission success. These inputs and outputs form the foundational elements necessary for a robust mission and will be mapped to the KG in a later step.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII-C Planning\\n\\n\\nOnce the tasks and sub-tasks are defined, the planning step requires establishing a valid sub-tasks ordering. This ordering should reflect a logical sequence that ensures all prerequisites are met before moving on to subsequent tasks. The primary goal in this step is to verify that the proposed sequence will effectively lead to the achievement of the mission\\u2019s target conditions as outlined in the definition step. A well-ordered plan serves as a roadmap for the subsequent stages, facilitating smooth execution and integration.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII-D Representation\\n\\n\\nThe representation step involves mapping the inputs and outputs of each sub-task to a KG representation. This step is critical for translating the relevant data identified through the task list into a form that can be effectively utilized within the KG framework. By aligning the inputs and outputs with the KG, it is ensured that the necessary information is available and properly organized for efficient querying and control.\\n\\n\\n\\nII-D1 Knowledge Extraction\\n\\nTo apply this methodology to any given ROS 2 based system, it is essential to design a data extraction method tailored to the system\\u2019s specific architecture, data sources and domain ensuring accurate and efficient information retrieval.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII-D2 Concept Design\\n\\nDuring the concept design step, the designer should define how the data will be represented as distinct entities and identify the relationships that connect these entities in the KG. Accurately mapping the data to the KG is essential to ensure that the KG properly represents the system\\u2019s components and their interactions. This alignment is crucial for the system\\u2019s decisions and actions to be consistent with its overall goals.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII-D3 Knowledge Mapping\\n\\nIn this phase, mechanisms are developed to transform raw data into a structured format compliant with the entities and relationships defined in the concept design stage. Given that the methodology is designed to be applied to any ROS 2 system, it is essential to customize these mechanisms to fit the specific system in use.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII-E Mission Design\\n\\n\\nWith the KG structure established, a high-level language is used to specify the mission during this step, including detailed control sequences and queries to interact with the KG. This enables the robot to execute the mission autonomously, with continuous mapping of inputs and outputs to the KG to adapt to changes and make informed decisions. Additionally, during this step, the designer should validate that the specified mission produces the outcomes defined in the definition step.\\n\\n\\n\", \"III ROS 2 KG Implementation\": \"\\n\\nIII ROS 2 KG Implementation\\n\\n\\nOne of the most relevant parts of the methodology is the representation step, which involves the knowledge representation within the KG. To deal with the issues that arise from the handling of knowledge, we have developed different ROS 2 modules that can be used to integrate knowledge graphs into an existing ROS 2 based system. These modules fulfill three main functions:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nKnowledge Base: A ROS 2 node that is in charge of storing the KG data. This node allows for inserting, querying, and deleting both nodes in the KG and edges between them. Additionally, these KG nodes can also store numerical values in terms of properties, which can be quite useful in the robotics domain.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nKnowledge Extractors: These components are different ROS 2 nodes in charge of interfacing with the current robotic system to be able to extract the relevant knowledge to be added to the KG. Those ROS 2 nodes subscribe to the different available topics and process the published data to generate knowledge. Additionally, they also handle data already contained in the KG to generate new knowledge.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\n\\nKnowledge Retrievers: These components allow to query the KG about the entities contained within it and the relationships between them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn terms of software architecture, the knowledge base ROS 2 node centralizes all the information related to the system, while the extractor and retriever ROS 2 nodes interact with it in an N-to-1 fashion during the execution of a given mission.\\n\\n\\nAdditionally, to handle multi-agent missions, the software generates a local KG for each agent and then merges them into a single KG ensuring there are no duplicate entities. This strategy allows each drone to perform independent missions, reducing read and reaction times. For example, when two drones share airspace, the shared KG benefits mission execution by including entities such as the operator\\u2019s position or flight status. Furthermore, the drones can infer new knowledge, such as the relative position between them (e.g., \\u201dclose\\u201d)\\n\\n\", \"IV USE CASE: SEARCH AND RESCUE SCENARIO\": \"\\n\\nIV USE CASE: SEARCH AND RESCUE SCENARIO\\n\\n\\nIn this section, the objective is to test the proposed methodology and the software tools developed during this work in a multi-drone search and rescue mission.\\n\\n\\nThe original robotic system that we will improve using KGs is Aerostack2. Aerostack2 is an open-source software framework designed to create autonomous multi-robot aerial systems. Its modular architecture and multi-robot orientation make it a versatile platform-independent environment capable of addressing a wide range of capabilities for autonomous operation. ROS 2, on the other hand, is an evolution of the popular Robot Operating System (ROS), designed to overcome the limitations of its predecessor. It provides tools, libraries, and conventions for building complex robotic systems and supports multiple programming languages, making it accessible to a wide variety of developers.\\n\\n\\nThe presented use case involves a mission where a set of drones must locate a target in an environment. This mission will be simulated in a Gazebo environment as shown in Figure 2, with the drones autonomously executing the mission using Aerostack2. Knowledge extractors specifically tailored for Aerostack2 will be employed as described in Section III and Figure 3 to enable efficient knowledge handling, integrating the KG capabilities into Aerostack2. This setup will demonstrate how the drones, powered by the advanced knowledge representation and decision-making processes, can effectively carry out the mission in a simulated scenario.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: The Gazebo simulation environment.\\n\\n\\nFigure 3: A graphical view of the application of the methodology to enhance Aerostack2. Green components are the ones introduced to the system through the application of the methodology, while blue ones are related to Aerostack2. Knowledge extraction is allocated in each one of the agents, while the knowledge base and the knowledge retrievers are centralized.\\n\\n\\nDefinition Stage: The mission objective is to inspect a specific area and determine the location of a desired object. The requirements are two drones that can execute autonomous flights, able to perceive their environment, and locate the object of interest. Additionally, the drones must have the capability to continuously monitor the state of their battery and their own location.\\n\\n\\nThis mission aims to evaluate the behavior of the KG both when a single agent knowledge is introduced and when the knowledge expected by multiple agents is integrated into a unified graph. This evaluation will allow us to determine the efficiency and effectiveness of the KG in situations with varying levels of complexity and coordination among multiple autonomous agents.\\n\\n\\nStructuring Stage: The mission can be divided into two main tasks: traversing a defined area and searching for an object, in addition to the tasks responsible for the continuous monitoring of the drones. The full list of identified tasks and sub-tasks is presented in Table I.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTask\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSub-task\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTraverse a defined area\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDetermine the current position of the agent\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCurrent position of each drone\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDetermine the required route to cover the remaining area\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCurrent position of each drone\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRemaining path to cover the area\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSearch and localization of the object\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCapture environmental information\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUse onboard cameras\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRecognize the desired object in the camera image\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCamera image\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLabel the image as contains or does not contain the object\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDrone supervision\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBattery status\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHigh or low level\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelative position between drones\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClose or not close\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMaintain position or move\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNavigation status\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLanded/Flying\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable I: Tasks and sub-tasks identified for the mission consisting of locating a person in an environment.\\n\\n\\nPlanning Stage: Initially, each drone operates independently. The first task is to check its battery status to ensure mission continuity. This check must be performed periodically throughout the mission; if a low battery level is detected, an emergency landing must be carried out if the drone has already taken off, or the takeoff must be prevented if it has not. Additionally, the other drone will take on the responsibility of inspecting the entire area.\\n\\n\\nAfter verifying the battery, the drone will take off and head to its inspection area, where it will start sweeping the zone. If it detects the individual, it will send a signal and wait for the other drone to approach so that they can send the individual\\u2019s coordinates to the operator. Conversely, if the drone does not locate the individual but receives a signal from the other drone, it will halt its trajectory and proceed to the indicated position.\\n\\n\\nFinally, if neither drone locates the individual, both will complete the inspection of their respective areas and return to the origin station, where they will proceed to land.\\n\\n\\nRepresentation Stage:\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nKnowledge Extraction: With the necessary parameters and information for successful mission execution determined by an expert technician, the next step is to extract and maintain this knowledge. Utilizing Aerostack2, we can subscribe to relevant topics like position and battery status, ensuring that these data are continuously updated and readily available for accurate and reliable mission execution.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nConcept Design: The identified entities in the KG are listed in Table II. Since the relevant knowledge to be stored is related to the current state of each drone, the most important edges between are the ones connecting the drone to the person to indicate if it has located the person, those linking a drone to a status entity to describe its current activity, and the edges linking drones to other drones to indicate proximity and avoid collisions.

This involves converting the information into entities and relationships that the graph can support. After completing this step, the KG state in the initial situation defined in the mission is shown in Figure 4.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 4: Initial state of the KG.

By systematically defining, structuring, planning, and representing mission-critical tasks, and by tailoring data extraction methods to specific systems, this approach ensures accurate and efficient integration of knowledge graphs.

Through this methodology, robotic systems can achieve greater reliability, adaptability, and performance in complex mission scenarios.\\n\\n\\nOne of the primary challenges of the proposed methodology is that it places the responsibility on the user to manually design how perceived information is mapped to nodes and edges in the knowledge graph. This task requires careful consideration of how system data, such as sensor readings or mission status, should be represented in the graph structure. While this approach provides flexibility, it can also be complex and time-consuming, as it requires a deep understanding of both the system and the knowledge graph to ensure accurate and meaningful representation.\\n\\n\\nThe practical application of this methodology is demonstrated through a mission to locate a person using drones, implemented within the Aerostack2 framework.

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [18] and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [9] have achieved high-fidelity rendering, with 3DGS in particular becoming the mainstream choice for its real-time rendering capability. However, both methods require densely captured training images, which are often difficult to obtain, and they tend to produce artifacts at extrapolated viewpoints, namely those outside the interpolation range of the training views. These limitations hinder their use in downstream applications such as autonomous driving simulation and free-viewpoint user experiences.\\n\\n\\nRecent work has explored addressing artifacts in extrapolated view rendering with 3DGS. Existing approaches fall into two categories: adding regularization terms during training or augmenting supervision views using generative models. The regularization terms are often derived from 3D priors [48, 52, 10, 50, 32], or additional sensors [21], but they are typically hand-crafted and limited to specific scene types. Moreover, their lack of hallucination capability further restricts their applicability.\\nIn leveraging diffusion models (DMs), some approaches fine-tune them with paired data, e.g., by using sparse LiDAR inputs or extrapolated renderings with artifacts to generate refined images. Many of these methods train on domain-specific datasets, such as those for autonomous driving [41, 36, 20, 35], which inevitably compromises the generalization ability of DMs. More recently, Difix3D+ [37] fine-tunes SD Turbo [25] on a wider range of 3D datasets, improving generalization. However, the substantial effort required to curate 3D data and the high fine-tuning cost make this approach time-consuming and expensive to extend to other DMs.\\nAn alternative line of work seeks to improve extrapolated rendering without fine-tuning, typically by providing extrapolated renderings as guidance during the denoising step. This preserves the generalization capacity of DMs trained on large-scale data, but such methods still lag behind fine-tuned approaches that are specifically adapted to the task.\\n\\n\\nGiven the generalization\\u2013fidelity trade-off, we ask: can extrapolated view rendering be improved with DMs without sacrificing generalization? To address this challenge, we focus on fine-tuning-free methods and enhance their effectiveness for NVS extrapolation. This is achieved with our proposed 2D\\u20133D interleaved refinement strategy combined with per-pixel confidence guidance for fine-tuning-free image refinement. Specifically, given a trained 3DGS, we sample an extrapolated viewpoint, render the 2D image, refine it with a 2D image diffusion model (IDMs), and integrate the refined image back into the 3D scene by updating the 3DGS before proceeding to the next viewpoint.\\nThis interleaved 2D-3D refinement ensures that previously enhanced views inform subsequent 2D refinements and improve multi-view consistency. Importantly, we introduce a confidence-guided 2D refinement, where a per-pixel confidence map rendered from the 3DGS highlights regions requiring further improvement by the 2D DM. This contrasts with previous training-free methods that rely solely on rendering opacity, leaving the DM to identify artifact regions on its own. While our confidence guidance could in principle be applied to video diffusion models (VDMs), advanced video backbones are typically more computationally expensive and use temporal down-sampling, which prevents the direct use of per-pixel guidance. We show that our 2D\\u20133D interleaved optimization strategy achieves consistent refined images without relying on VDMs.\\n\\n\\nOur contribution can be summarized as follows: 1) We propose a simple yet effective approach for enhancing extrapolated 3DGS rendering without the need for fine-tuning DMs, featuring a 2D\\u20133D interleaved refinement strategy and per-pixel confidence guidance. 2) Our method is compatible with various DMs and preserves generalization across diverse scene contents. 3) Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing fine-tuning-free methods and achieves comparable or even superior performance to training-based methods.\\n\\n\", \"2 Related Work\": \"\\n\\n2 Related Work\\n\\nNumerous works have made efforts on improving quality of NVS. In this section, we will discuss related works in NVS and 3D reconstruction. Furthermore, we will explore efforts that improve NVS quality by incorporating priors from geometry, physics or generative models.\\n\\n\\nNovel View Synthesis: \\nNVS aims to generate photorealistic images of a scene from novel viewpoints. Early methods primarily relied on traditional image-based rendering techniques, such as Light Field Rendering [14], Image-Based Rendering [28], and Multi-Plane Image [55, 30]. These approaches typically interpolate between existing views and are often limited by dense input imagery and struggle with complex occlusions. The advent of deep learning revolutionized NVS, led by two major paradigms: NeRF [18] and 3DGS [9]. NeRF implicitly represents a scene and achieves high-quality results, but its training and rendering speeds are slow. In contrast, 3DGS offers rapid training and real-time rendering. However, a significant limitation of 3DGS is the occurrence of visual artifacts in extrapolated views, which are viewpoints far from the training data. These artifacts compromise the realism and geometric fidelity of the synthesized images. Mitigating these artifacts is the focus of this paper.\\n\\n\\nNVS with Geometry Priors: \\nTo enhance the robustness of NVS models and reduce reconstruction ambiguity, many works have introduced geometry priors. These priors provide key information about the scene\\u2019s 3D structure, which can be explicitly provided by external sensors like LiDAR or depth cameras [21, 41, 36, 23, 40, 17, 8]. Other methods utilize strong structural priors often found in real-world scenes, such as the assumption that the ground is a flat plane [52, 10, 5], the sky can be modeled as a dome [4, 43], or that walls and tables in indoor scenes are predominantly orthogonal [48]. These structural assumptions help regularize the reconstruction process. While these geometry priors can mitigate some reconstruction challenges, they often fall short of completely solving the artifact problem in extrapolated views, especially when the initial geometric prior is itself inaccurate.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: Method. FreeFix improves the rendering quality of extrapolated views in 3DGS without fine-tuning DMs, as illustrated in the bottom left of the pipeline. We propose an interleaved strategy that combines 2D and 3D refinement to utilize image diffusion models for generating multi-frame consistent results, as shown at the top of the pipeline. In the 2D refinement stage, we also introduce confidence guidance and overall guidance to enhance the quality and consistency of the denoising results.\\n\\n\\nNVS with Generative Priors: \\nGenerative priors leverage pre-trained generative models to assist NVS tasks, particularly when dealing with data scarcity or missing information. Early works explored using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to improve rendering quality [39, 24, 26], where the GAN\\u2019s discriminator ensured the local realism of synthesized images. More recently, DMs [33, 22, 13, 31, 42, 11, 12, 34] have gained prominence for their powerful generative capabilities. Their application in NVS falls into two main categories. The first involves fine-tuning a pre-trained DM, which has learned powerful priors from datasets [37, 41, 35, 38, 54, 49, 47]. This process adapts the model\\u2019s knowledge to scene-specific appearances but can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. The second category, which aligns with our proposed method, leverages a pre-trained DM as a zero-shot prior without fine-tuning. The key challenge here is determining what part of the rendered image should be used as guidance for the DM, and how to maintain multi-view consistency. Using the opacity channel of the rendered image as guidance is a common but often crude solution [45, 16, 46], as areas with high opacity can still be artifacts. Additionally, ensuring consistency across different novel views using IDMs is a critical problem. While VDMs [33, 31, 42, 11] can inherently handle this, they are often computationally heavy and not suitable for all applications.\\n\\n\", \"3 Method\": \"\\n\\n3 Method\\n\\nThe FreeFix pipeline is illustrated in Fig.\\u00a02.

VDMs are widely used for improving 3DGS [9] because of the inherent capability to apply attention across frames, ensuring multi-frame consistency. However, the temporal attention mechanism also introduces a computational burden,\\nwhich also limits the output length of VDMs, as the computation complexity is quadratic in relation to the sequence length. Furthermore, recent advanced VDMs [42, 11, 31] utilize 3D VAE as their encoder and decoder, which performs temporal down-sampling, making it challenging to apply per-pixel confidence guidance.\\n\\n\\nDue to the above reasons, we select IDMs as the backbone in FreeFix. However, most existing IDMs are not designed for the novel view synthesis task and do not take reference views as input. IP-Adapter [44] accepts image prompts as input, but it is intended for style prompts rather than novel view synthesis. Directly applying IDMs can lead to inconsistency across frames and finally result in blurriness in refined 3DGS. To tackle the problem, we propose an interleaved refining strategy, multi-level confidence guidance, and overall guidance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3 Interleaved Refinement Strategy\\n\\n2D Refinement: \\nAs mentioned in Sec.\\u00a03.1, the trajectory of extrapolated views \\ud835\\udcafext={\\ud835\\udcb10e,\\ud835\\udcb11e,\\u2026,\\ud835\\udcb1me}\\\\mathcal{T}_{\\\\textit{ext}}=\\\\{\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{0},\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{1},...,\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{m}\\\\} in our task definition is intended to be continuous. This continuous trajectory setting ensures that adjacent views \\ud835\\udcb1ie\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i} and \\ud835\\udcb1i+1e\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i+1} undergo only small transformations. A naive approach to keep consistency would be warping pixels from \\ud835\\udcb1ie\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i} to \\ud835\\udcb1i+1e\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i+1} and using DMs for inpainting. However, both rendered depth and predicted depth are not reliable for warping. Instead, we propose an interleaved refining strategy to enhance multi-view consistency.\\n\\n\\nSpecifically, the refining process is interleaved and incremental along the trajectory \\ud835\\udcaf\\\\mathcal{T}. Given the current view \\ud835\\udcb1ie\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i}, the current 3DGS \\ud835\\udca2i\\u22121\\\\mathcal{G}_{i-1} and rendered image \\u2110^ie=\\u03c0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb1ie;\\ud835\\udca2i\\u22121)\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e}_{i}=\\\\pi(\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i};\\\\mathcal{G}_{i-1}), we utilize denoising with guidance, as discussed in Sec.\\u00a03.4, to obtain the fixed image \\u2110^ie,f\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{i}. We also maintain a fixed image set \\u2131i\\u22121={(\\ud835\\udcb10e,\\u2110^0e,f),(\\ud835\\udcb11e,\\u2110^1e,f),\\u2026,(\\ud835\\udcb1i\\u22121e,\\u2110^i\\u22121e,f)}\\\\mathcal{F}_{i-1}=\\\\{(\\\\mathcal{V}_{0}^{e},\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{0}),(\\\\mathcal{V}_{1}^{e},\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{1}),...,(\\\\mathcal{V}_{i-1}^{e},\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{i-1})\\\\}. We refine the current 3DGS \\ud835\\udca2i\\u22121\\\\mathcal{G}_{i-1} to \\ud835\\udca2i\\\\mathcal{G}_{i} by using the training set \\ud835\\udcaet\\u200br\\u200ba\\u200bi\\u200bn\\\\mathcal{S}_{train}, the previous refined view set \\u2131i\\u22121\\\\mathcal{F}_{i-1} and the current refined image \\u2110^ie,f\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{i}.\\n\\n\\n3D Refinement: \\nThe supervision during 3D Refinement for \\ud835\\udca2i\\\\mathcal{G}_{i} comes from current refined view (\\ud835\\udcb1ie,\\u2110^ie,f)(\\\\mathcal{V}_{i}^{e},\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{i}), \\u2131i\\u22121\\\\mathcal{F}_{i-1} and St\\u200br\\u200ba\\u200bi\\u200bnS_{train}. The detailed sampling strategy for training is illustrated in the supplements.\\n\\n\\nThe generated results do not guarantee 3D consistency with training views, so we employ a smaller training loss for the generated views to prevent inaccurately generated areas from distorting 3D scenes. Additionally, the generated results exhibit slightly color bias compared to training views, which are often difficult for humans to distinguish. However, when applying the interleaved refining strategy, these slight color biases will accumulate, which may lead to a blurry and over-gray effect. We implement a simple yet efficient technique similar to [53] to tackle the problem. For each generated view, we define two optimizable affine matrices \\ud835\\udc9cf\\u2208\\u211d3\\u00d73\\\\mathcal{A}_{f}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{3\\\\times 3} and \\ud835\\udc9cb\\u2208\\u211d3\\u00d71\\\\mathcal{A}_{b}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{3\\\\times 1}. The rendering results used for computing the training loss are applied to these affine matrices to avoid learning color bias:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2110^e\\u2032=\\ud835\\udc9cf\\u00d7\\u2110e^+\\ud835\\udc9cb\\\\displaystyle\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e^{\\\\prime}}=\\\\mathcal{A}_{f}\\\\times\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}^{e}}+\\\\mathcal{A}_{b}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2112=(1\\u2212\\u03bbs)\\u200b\\u2016\\u2110^e\\u2032\\u2212\\u2110^e,f\\u20161+\\u03bbs\\u200bSSIM\\u200b(\\u2110^\\u2032,\\u2110^e,f)\\\\displaystyle\\\\mathcal{L}=(1-\\\\lambda_{s})||\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e^{\\\\prime}}-\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}||_{1}+\\\\lambda_{s}\\\\textit{SSIM}(\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{{}^{\\\\prime}},\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f})\\n\\n(4)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRendered RGB w Artifacts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u03b3c=0.001\\\\gamma_{c}=0.001\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u03b3c=0.01\\\\gamma_{c}=0.01\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u03b3c=0.1\\\\gamma_{c}=0.1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 4: Multi-Level Certainty Masks. FreeFix employs multiple \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} to obtain multi-level certainty masks as guidance. Each level of mask guides a different stage of denoising. A small \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} with high overall certainty is used for the early stages of denoising, while a large \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} which offers greater accuracy, is applied during the later stages of denoising.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4 Denoising with Guidance\\n\\nGiven the rendered results of an extrapolated view, even though the image contains artifacts, most areas can still be regarded as photo-realistic rendering results. These regions with relatively high fidelity can provide essential information for generating an image free of artifacts, while maintaining almost the same content.\\n\\n\\nExperiments in Difix3D+ [37] have demonstrated that adding noise to images with artifacts and directly applying denoising using DMs can effectively remove these artifacts; however, the strength of the added noise is quite sensitive. For regions with significant artifacts, a larger scale of noise is needed to repaint those areas, while a smaller scale of noise is sufficient for areas with minimal artifacts. Although it may seem intuitive to apply different levels of noise to different regions, this approach does not align the data distribution of DMs. Instead, employing guidance during the diffusion denoising step is more practical and has been widely adopted in [16, 45].\\n\\n\\nConfidence Map: \\nUtilizing appropriate guidance is an effective method for generating high-fidelity images while preserving accurate rendering results. However, current approaches that use warp masks or rendering opacities as guidance weights do not account for the presence of artifacts. For example, as illustrated in Fig.\\u00a03 (a), even when severe artifacts are present, the rendering opacities remain high, indicating that these artifacts continue to act as strong guidance during the denoising process.\\nTo tackle this issue, we propose utilizing confidence masks as guidance weights, as shown in Fig.\\u00a03 (c). The confidence scores are derived from Fisher information, which is also referenced in [7, 6]. Specifically, Fisher information measures the amount of information that the observation (x,y)(x,y) carries about the unknown parameters ww that model pf\\u200b(y|x;w)p_{f}(y|x;w). In the context of novel view synthesis, Fisher information can be defined as:\\n\\n\\n\\npf\\u200b(\\u03c0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)|\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)p_{f}(\\\\pi(\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})|\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})\\n\\n(5)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udcb1\\\\mathcal{V} and \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G} represent viewpoint and 3DGS respectively, while \\u03c0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)\\\\pi(\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}) denotes the volume rendering results at the specific view \\ud835\\udcb1\\\\mathcal{V}.\\n\\n\\nThe negative log likelihood of Fisher information in Eq.\\u00a05, which serves as the uncertainty \\ud835\\udc9e\\u00af\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{\\\\bar{C}}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}} of \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G} at view \\ud835\\udcb1\\\\mathcal{V}, can be approximately derived as a Hessian matrix, the detailed derivation can be found in the supplementary materials:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9e\\u00af\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\\\displaystyle\\\\mathcal{\\\\bar{C}}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}\\n=\\u2212log\\u2061pf\\u200b(\\u03c0|\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)\\\\displaystyle=-\\\\log p_{f}(\\\\pi|\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n=\\ud835\\udc07\\u2032\\u2032\\u200b[\\u03c0|\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2]\\\\displaystyle=\\\\mathbf{H}^{{}^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}}[\\\\pi|\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n=\\u2207\\ud835\\udca2\\u03c0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)T\\u200b\\u2207\\ud835\\udca2\\u03c0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)\\\\displaystyle=\\\\nabla_{\\\\mathcal{G}}\\\\pi(\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})^{T}\\\\nabla_{\\\\mathcal{G}}\\\\pi(\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})\\n\\n(6)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[7, 6] renders the attribute \\ud835\\udc9e\\u00af\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{\\\\bar{C}}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}} in volume rendering to obtain the uncertainty map. However, uncertainty is not a numerically stable representation, as its value can range from [0,+\\u221e)[0,+\\\\infty). As illustrated in Fig.\\u00a03 (b), the numeric instability of uncertainty may render an inaccurate uncertainty map. This often occurs when there are Gaussians with low opacity and high uncertainty, which can overwhelm the volume rendering. Instead, we use the complementary value as guidance, certainty \\ud835\\udc9e\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}, also referred to as confidence in this paper, which has a stable numeric range of [0,1][0,1].\\nThe certainty \\ud835\\udc9e\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\u03b3c\\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}^{\\\\gamma_{c}} is defined as:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9e\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\u03b3c=exp\\u2061[\\u2212\\u03b3c\\u200b\\ud835\\udc9e\\u00af\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2]\\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}^{\\\\gamma_{c}}=\\\\exp[-\\\\gamma_{c}\\\\mathcal{\\\\bar{C}}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}]\\n\\n(7)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} is a hyperparameter.

In the later denoising stages, DMs tend to generate detailed appearances, so we provide \\u2133\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\u03b3c\\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}^{\\\\gamma_{c}} with a large \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} to ensure that the guidance is sufficiently accurate.\\n\\n\\nConfidence Guidance: \\nGiven the rendered image I^\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\\\hat{I}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}} and the corresponding confidence map \\u2133\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\u03b3c\\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}^{\\\\gamma_{c}}, we can provide denoising guidance to DMs.\\nWe denote the rendered image after VAE encoding as x0rx_{0}^{r}, and the resized confidence map that aligns with the shape of the latent space as \\u2133c\\\\mathcal{M}^{c}. As illustrated in Eq.\\u00a02, the predicted x0tx_{0}^{t} at tt timestep is given by xt\\u2212\\u03c3t\\u200b\\ud835\\udd3d\\u03b8\\u200b(xt,t)x_{t}-\\\\sigma_{t}\\\\mathbb{F}_{\\\\theta}(x_{t},t). We guide the model prediction as x0t,gx_{0}^{t,g} by blending the rendered image using confidence mask:\\n\\n\\n\\nx0t,g=\\u2133c\\u2299x0r+(1\\u2212\\u2133c)\\u2299x0tx_{0}^{t,g}=\\\\mathcal{M}^{c}\\\\odot x_{0}^{r}+(1-\\\\mathcal{M}^{c})\\\\odot x_{0}^{t}\\n\\n(9)\\n\\n\\nHowever, the input for the next denoising step cannot be directly obtained using Eq.\\u00a03 since the model prediction x0tx_{0}^{t} has been changed. Instead, we derive the new xt\\u22121x_{t-1} by solving the following equations:\\n\\n\\n\\nxt\\u22121\\\\displaystyle x_{t-1}\\n=x0+\\u03c3t\\u22121\\u200b\\ud835\\udd3d\\u03b8\\u200b(xt,t)\\\\displaystyle=x_{0}+\\\\sigma_{t-1}\\\\mathbb{F}_{\\\\theta}(x_{t},t)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nxt\\u22121\\\\displaystyle x_{t-1}\\n=xt+(\\u03c3t\\u22121\\u2212\\u03c3t)\\u200b\\ud835\\udd3d\\u03b8\\u200b(xt,t)\\\\displaystyle=x_{t}+(\\\\sigma_{t-1}-\\\\sigma_{t})\\\\mathbb{F}_{\\\\theta}(x_{t},t)\\n\\n(10)\\n\\n\\nThe representation of xt\\u22121x_{t-1} derived from x0t,gx_{0}^{t,g} and xtx_{t} is:\\n\\n\\n\\nxt\\u22121=\\u03c3t\\u22121\\u03c3t\\u200bxt\\u2212\\u03c3t\\u22121\\u2212\\u03c3t\\u03c3t\\u200bx0t,gx_{t-1}=\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{t-1}}{\\\\sigma_{t}}x_{t}-\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{t-1}-\\\\sigma_{t}}{\\\\sigma_{t}}x_{0}^{t,g}\\n\\n(11)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOverall Guidance: \\nAlthough the interleaved refining strategy provides higher fidelity rendering results and ensures that the rendering is more consistent with the generated content, using IDMs may still encounter issues of inconsistency in areas with low confidence. Particularly in regions with weak textures like ground and sky, the confidence map tends to be low, and allowing denoising to proceed freely in these areas can result in high inconsistency and blurriness in 3DGS. To address this issue, we propose an overall guidance approach, which combines confidence guidance in the very early stages of denoising to provide structural hints for the images.\\nThe combination of certainty and overall guidance is defined as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\nx0t,g=\\\\displaystyle x_{0}^{t,g}=\\n\\u2133c\\u2299x0r+\\\\displaystyle\\\\mathcal{M}^{c}\\\\odot x_{0}^{r}+\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(1\\u2212\\u2133c)\\u2299(\\u03b2\\u200b\\u2133\\u03b1\\u200bx0r+(1\\u2212\\u03b2\\u200b\\u2133\\u03b1)\\u200bx0t)\\\\displaystyle(1-\\\\mathcal{M}^{c})\\\\odot(\\\\beta\\\\mathcal{M}^{\\\\alpha}x_{0}^{r}+(1-\\\\beta\\\\mathcal{M}^{\\\\alpha})x_{0}^{t})\\n\\n(12)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u03b2\\\\beta is a hyperparameter that controls the strength of the overall guidance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLLFF [19]\\n\\n\\nMip-NeRF 360 [1]\\n\\n\\nWaymo \\u2009 [29]\\n\\nDM Type\\nw/o Finetune\\nOnly RGBs\\n3D Render\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPSNR\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nSSIM\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nLPIPS\\u2193\\\\downarrow\\n\\n\\nPSNR\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nSSIM\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nLPIPS\\u2193\\\\downarrow\\n\\n\\nKID\\u2193\\\\downarrow\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3DGS [9]\\n\\n18.10\\n0.633\\n0.265\\n21.83\\n0.643\\n0.239\\n0.155\\nN/A\\nN/A\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\nFreeFix + SDXL\\n19.93\\n0.695\\n0.237\\n22.68\\n0.685\\n0.213\\n0.150\\nImage\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\nFreeFix + Flux\\n20.12\\n0.700\\n0.221\\n23.02\\n0.689\\n0.208\\n0.147\\nImage\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\n\\nViewExtrapolator [16]\\n\\n18.27\\n0.614\\n0.338\\n20.84\\n0.591\\n0.332\\n0.180\\nVideo\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\n\\nNVS-Solver [45]\\n\\n11.99\\n0.351\\n0.560\\n12.45\\n0.266\\n0.631\\n0.289\\nVideo\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2718\\n\\n\\n\\nDifix3D+ [37]\\n\\n18.86\\n0.658\\n0.239\\n22.43\\n0.661\\n0.210\\n0.143\\nImage\\n\\u2718\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\n\\nStreetCrafter [41]\\n\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\n0.157\\nVideo\\n\\u2718\\n\\u2718\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 1: Quantitative Comparison with Baselines.

We select LLFF [19] as the evaluation dataset for forward-facing scenes, Mip-NeRF 360 [1] for object-centric scenes, and Waymo [29] for driving scenes.\\nFor the LLFF and MipNeRF datasets, which contain relatively dense captured images, we select sparse or partially observed views as the training set and choose an extrapolated view trajectory that is distant from the views in the training set. The Waymo dataset only provides captured images from a single pass down the street, making it relatively sparse. We only utilize the front cameras as the training set and then translate or rotate the training cameras to create the test views. Details on the design of the training and testing views are provided in the supplementary materials.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWaymo / 143481\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWaymo / 177619\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3DGS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nViewExtrapolator [45]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStreetCrafter [41]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDifix3D+ [37]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFreeFix\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 7: Qualitative Comparisons on Waymo [29]. FreeFix provide superior performance compared to ViewExtrapolator and StreetCrafter, and is comparable to Difix3D+ in the Waymo dataset. In some cases, FreeFix refines the scene even better than Difix3D+.\\n\\n\\n\\nModel Settings and Baselines: \\nFreeFix utilizes two powerful IDMs as its backbone: SDXL [22] and Flux [13], to showcase the capabilities of our method.\\nFor baseline selection, we consider various methods with different settings. For fine-tuning-free methods, we select ViewExtrapolator [16], and NVS-Solver [45] as the baseline. While ViewExtrapolator refines 3DGS with generated views like ours, NVS-Solver employs VDMs as the final renderer, without using 3D renderers, which consumes more computational resources during rendering.\\nFor methods that require fine-tuning of DMs, we choose Difix3D+ [37] and StreetCrafter [41] as baselines. StreetCrafter focuses on urban scenes and requires both LiDAR and RGB observations as input, while Difix3D+ is more generalizable and only requires RGB images. For all methods with a 3D renderer, we apply nearly the same 3D refining steps, ensuring that there are sufficient refining steps for the models to converge.\\n\\n\\nEvaluation Metrics: \\nFor the experiments on LLFF and MipNeRF, we adopt the most common settings for quantitative assessments, which include the evaluation of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS [51]. In the case of the Waymo dataset, where no ground truth is available for the test images, we utilize KID [2] for quantitative assessments.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.1 Comparison with Baselines\\n\\nWe evaluate FreeFix using SDXL [22] and Flux [13] as the diffusion backbone on the LLFF, Mip-NeRF 360, and Waymo datasets. This includes a quantitative comparison in Tab.\\u00a01 and qualitative comparisons in Fig.\\u00a05 and Fig.\\u00a07 against baseline methods. Although FreeFix utilizes only IDMs as the backbone and does not require fine-tuning of the DMs, it still demonstrates performance that is comparable to, or even surpasses, methods that use VDMs or require fine-tuning, both in quantitative and qualitative assessments.\\n\\n\\nSpecifically, ViewExtrapolator [16], which uses opacity masks as guidance, shows slight improvements in LLFF, although the improvement is less significant compared to our confidence-guided solution.\\nMoreover, it fails to provide improvements in Mip-NeRF 360 and Waymo.\\nThis is due to the fact that ViewExtrapolator uses the nearest view from a set of training views as the reference view to generate the test views in a video diffusion model.\\nWhile using the nearest training view as the reference view in SVD performs well in the forward-facing scenes in LLFF, where the test views are closer to the training views, this is usually not the case for Mip-NeRF 360 and Waymo, hence ViewExtrapolator yields degraded performance.\\n\\n\\nDifix3D+ demonstrates the most generalizability and powerful performance across our baselines. FreeFix surpasses Difix3D+ [37] in LLFF and Mip-NeRF 360, while providing comparable performance in Waymo.\\nWe attribute this to the generalizability of DMs. Although Difix3D+ is finetuned on DLV3D [15] and may have encountered similar scenes to those in LLFF and Mip-NeRF 360, the domain gap between datasets still weakens the generalizability of Difix3D+. In contrast, our method maintains the original generalizability of DMs learned from web-scale datasets. Regarding the Waymo dataset, Difix3D+ is fine-tuned on a large-scale in-house driving dataset, where driving scenes are highly structured and exhibit relatively small inter-class differences, making them easier for models to learn.\\n\\n\\nStreetCrafter [41] is tailored for urban scenes and requires LiDAR as input; for this reason, we only conduct experiments with this model on the Waymo dataset. In contrast to the original setting in StreetCrafter, our setup only provides the front camera to color the LiDAR points, which highlights the limitations of StreetCrafter in this context.\\nNVS-Solver produces less satisfying results compared to other methods, which may be attributed to inaccurate depth estimation and warping results. We provide NVS-Solver results in supplementary materials.\\n\\n\\nPlease note that we compute the average score across scenes for each dataset. We provide a quantitative comparison for each scene, along with additional qualitative comparisons in the supplementary materials.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.2 Ablation Study\\n\\nImage Diffusion Models vs Video Diffusion Models: \\nFreeFix can also be applied to VDMs without temporal down-sampling, such as SVD [3]. Although SVD offers inherent consistency across frames, it suffers from blurriness compared to more advanced IDMs. We conduct an ablation study on the scene from MipNeRF-360/Garden to provide quantitative and qualitative comparisons in Tab.\\u00a02 and Fig.\\u00a06. Additionally, we include the results from ViewExtrapolator [16] on the same scene. While ViewExtrapolator also uses SVD as its backbone, it employs an opacity mask as guidance, which disentangles the effects of the differences in diffusion model backbones and helps demonstrate the effectiveness of our confidence guidance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPSNR\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nSSIM\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nLPIPS\\u2193\\\\downarrow\\n\\nGuidance\\n\\n\\n3DGS\\n18.38\\n0.415\\n0.357\\nN/A\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVE [16] + SVD\\n\\n17.86\\n0.409\\n0.505\\nOpacity\\n\\n\\nFreeFix + SVD\\n19.03\\n0.453\\n0.331\\nCertainty\\n\\n\\nFreeFix + SDXL\\n19.41\\n0.517\\n0.294\\nCertainty\\n\\n\\nFreeFix + Flux\\n19.72\\n0.520\\n0.287\\nCertainty\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 2: Quantitative Ablation on Diffusion Models Selection. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPSNR\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nSSIM\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nLPIPS\\u2193\\\\downarrow\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRaw Flux [13]\\n\\n19.23\\n0.390\\n0.389\\n\\n\\n+ Confidence Guidance\\n19.32\\n0.435\\n0.349\\n\\n\\n+ Interleave Strategy\\n19.65\\n0.517\\n0.293\\n\\n\\n+ Overall Guidance\\n19.72\\n0.520\\n0.287\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 3: Ablation Study on Modules of FreeFix.

We conduct an ablation study of these modules on the scene from MipNeRF-360/Garden, as shown in Tab.\\u00a03. We perform experiments starting from a raw Flux model, which we slightly modify to function as an image-to-image model. We progressively add components from FreeFix to demonstrate the necessity of these techniques.\\n\\n\\n\", \"5 Conclusion\": \"\\n\\n5 Conclusion\\n\\nIn this paper, we present FreeFix, a method for fixing artifacts and improving the quality of 3DGS without fine-tuning DMs. FreeFix demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across various datasets and possesses strong capabilities for deployment with future, more advanced DMs.\\nHowever, FreeFix still has certain limitations. It may encounter failure cases when extrapolated views lead to excessive artifacts with minimal credible guidance. Additionally, the updating process for 3DGS is relatively slow and challenging to converge over dozens of refining steps. These challenges suggest opportunities for future work on designing more robust and efficient methods for integrating 3D reconstruction with 2D generative models.\\n\\n\\nAcknowledgements:\\nThis work is supported by NSFC under grant 62202418, U21B2004, and 62441223, the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2021ZD0114501, and Scientific Research Fund of Zhejiang University grant XY2025028.\\n\\n\\n\", \"6 3DGS Fisher Information Derivation\": \"\\n\\n6 3DGS Fisher Information Derivation\\n\\nThe uncertainty attribute of 3DGS in this paper is defined as:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9e\\u00af\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2=\\u2212log\\u2061pf\\u200b(\\u03c0|\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)\\\\mathcal{\\\\bar{C}}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}=-\\\\log p_{f}(\\\\pi|\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})\\n\\n(13)\\n\\n\\nUnder the following regularity conditions, \\u2212log\\u2061pf\\u200b(\\u03c0|\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)-\\\\log p_{f}(\\\\pi|\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}) can be viewed as a loss term for Fisher information.

However, the design for LLFF and Mip-NeRF 360 is not as straightforward, as we aim to construct extrapolated views that have ground truth images. For this reason, we cannot generate trajectories freely; instead, we need to create partitions for the testing and training sets. We present visualizations of the training and testing cameras in Fig.\\u00a08 from these scenes to illustrate the design of the extrapolated views.

In this subsection, we provide a comparison between using the uncertainty mask from [7] as guidance and our certainty mask as guidance. Specifically, for rendered uncertain masks \\u2133c\\u00af\\\\mathcal{M}^{\\\\bar{c}}, we use 1\\u2212\\u2133c\\u00af1-\\\\mathcal{M}^{\\\\bar{c}} as guidance to experiment on Garden in Mip-NeRF 360. As shown in Fig.\\u00a010 and Tab.\\u00a07, the images generated using uncertainty masks as guidance exhibit significant inconsistency, resulting in less satisfying performance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPSNR\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nSSIM\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nLPIPS\\u2193\\\\downarrow\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUncertainty Mask\\n19.30\\n0.515\\n0.310\\n\\n\\nCertainty Mask\\n19.72\\n0.520\\n0.287\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 7: Quantitative Comparison between Uncertainty and Certainty as Guidance. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n9.3 Ablation on Affine Transform\\n\\nWe apply an affine transform during 3D refinement to prevent 3DGS from learning slightly different color styles generated by diffusion models. In this subsection, we present an ablation study for this component on Garden in Mip-NeRF 360. As shown in Tab.\\u00a08, although removing the affine transform slightly improves PSNR, it results in a decrease in SSIM and LPIPS. Furthermore, as illustrated in Fig.\\u00a012, removing the affine transform results in large floaters in testing views, which can significantly lower human sensory preference.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNVS-Solver [45]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFreeFix\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 11: Comparisons on FreeFix and NVS-Solver.

These processes are characterised by a high degree of uncertainty coupled with demands of logistical flexibility, which traditionally implies the requirement for expensive reprogramming and reconfiguration of robots. This is of interest in domains such as nuclear decommissioning, robotic disassembly of complex products for recycling and re-use, and even areas such as robotic surgery or demolition with robotised demolition equipment. Nonetheless, challenges exist in automated planning and task execution for destructive operations. Whereas manufacturing paradigms centre around achieving high dimensional tolerances and precise control on a known workpiece, for disassembly, the precise location of cutting is less important (few mm as opposed to \\u03bc\\\\mum) while the precise sequence of cutting operations may not be known in advance. This uncertainty has motivated various approaches to robotic cutting, consisting of goal-conditioned trial-and-error & revision [25, 26], 3D reconstruction & planning [9], and online learning & adaptation [18, 22].\\n\\n\\nReinforcement learning (RL) has been applied with success to a variety of contact-rich tasks [2, 23], including robotic cutting [31, 15], particularly with difficult-to-model environments with complex robot-environment interactions, but are nonetheless data intensive. Whereas simulation environments offer reduced complexity and overhead of data collection, differences between simulated and physical cutting processes limit the applicability of adaptive methods to real-world tasks. Examples of such differences include motor backlash, tool wear, chattering, cross-domain mismatch of process and model parameters and other disturbances. These differences motivate the use of domain adaptation methods to align representations or behaviours across domains with minimal real-world supervision. These can be broadly separated into unified feature representation learning, model-based correction, and model-free synthesis of target domain examples.\\n\\n\\nDomain adaptive methods include [29] in which policies are trained on a cross-domain latent feature representation by aligning source and target domain distributions. A related concept applied to milling was proposed in [31] based on a cross-domain meta-model, trained on pairwise unified feature representations. Similarly, adversarial losses using domain discriminators have been employed for cross-domain tool wear classification [20]. Reconstruction-based methods have also been employed to jointly model observation and class distributions[12]; this concept has been further developed based on conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs) [33] wherein CVAE feature representations were used to train an RL policy, while feature representations are aligned across domains.\\n\\n\\nModel-based approaches have previously also been employed for domain adaptation, wherein a source domain task model is augmented with a corrective model based on physics-informed approaches [24], neural networks [13, 5] or Gaussian process (GP) models [19, 27] learned from target domain data. In our previous work, [16] we proposed an imitation learning framework in which a GP corrective model was learned from multiple cutting demonstrations. Nonetheless, model-based approaches incur limitations of modelling assumptions under which the models are introduced, and incur a dataset overhead, particularly for deep predictive modelling approaches.\\n\\n\\nRelating to the aforementioned approaches is direct alignment of observations across domains via translation or generative models. In the context of milling, [4] proposed a domain adaptation method for condition monitoring of different milling tools based on a generative CNN. Similarly, [30], proposed a domain adaptive imitation learning framework from visual demonstrations based on CycleGAN [32]. Generation at object level has also been proposed [17] wherein a StyleGAN image translation model is trained object-wise on weakly-paired cross-domain datasets for 6D pose estimation. CVAEs have also been employed for domain adaptation via synthesis of novel target domain examples [28].\\n\\n\\nNeural style transfer has been extensively researched in the context of image processing [11, 10]. Recently, this concept has been extended to motion execution. Thus far, its application has been limited largely to expressive stylised motions mirroring that of human operators [8, 7]. Nonetheless, its applicability to synthesise novel trajectories with characteristics of diverse human operators presents a compelling case for its application to other domain adaptation problems. Recently, this has been applied for dataset augmentation tasks [6]. A limitation of the aforementioned methods is lack of a suitable pairing mechanism for style and content, as well as lack of feature extractor backbones prevalent in image processing tasks. For transfer learning, addressed this problem [3] by building on the concept of conditional adversarial domain adaptation [21] to achieve feature-level style transfer for transfer learning. Nonetheless, adversarial alignment can be difficult to train, with well-known problems of mode collapse and vanishing gradients. Whereas these developments have been applied to time series classification problems, application of style transfer for RL policy transfer is, to the best of our knowledge, largely unexplored.\\n\\n\\nThis paper extends our previous example-based approach for sim-to-real adaptation to arbitrary real world examples. As with our previous work, our approach does not require re-training of classifiers or encoder networks to adapt to new scenarios (different disturbance forces, differing sensor dynamics, etc.). In contrast to prior work that applies neural style transfer primarily for stylised motion synthesis or dataset augmentation, we apply it as a trajectory-level domain adaptation mechanism for robotic skill transfer. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a latent-space pairing mechanism for content and style that operates without paired examples or retraining; (2) a novel transfer framework based on neural style transfer that does not require labelled or reward-supervised data from the target domain; and (3) empirical evaluation on robotic cutting, a task where conventional reinforcement learning pipelines are difficult to apply due to the absence of reward signal in the real-world deployment environment. An overview of our framework is provided in Figure 1.\\n\\n\\nFigure 1: Overview of proposed framework. In the first stage, a simulation of cutting mechanics is used to generate an expert policy and a variational autoencoder (VAE) is trained on simulated trajectory windows. In the second stage, the VAE encoded representations are used to generate pairings between a simulated and real world dataset which are used as style targets. Finally, expert trajectories are used to train a learner target domain policy with the generated observation windows.\\n\\n\", \"Style transfer framework\": \"\\nStyle transfer framework\\n\\nVariational autoencoder\\n\\nThe variational autoencoder (VAE) consists of two neural networks: an encoder q\\u03d5\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc9b|\\ud835\\udc99)q_{\\\\phi}(\\\\boldsymbol{z}|\\\\boldsymbol{x}) that approximates the posterior over latent variables \\ud835\\udc9b\\u2208\\u211dL\\\\boldsymbol{z}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{L}, and a decoder p\\u03b8\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc99|\\ud835\\udc9b)p_{\\\\theta}(\\\\boldsymbol{x}|\\\\boldsymbol{z}) that reconstructs the data from the latent representation.

Training was carried out with the Adam optimiser, with model hyperparameters established via manual search, reported in Table Style transfer. Both encoder and decoder networks were implemented as strided convolutional networks with 3 layers. Batch normalisation was further employed to accelerate convergence and reduce training instability. The encoder architecture is visualised in Figure 2.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: Overview of VAE encoder architecture; layer indices for style transfer are demarcated.\\n\\n\\nThe VAE training dataset consisted of a mixture of 680 on-policy and off-policy simulated trajectories. We consider a trajectory as a multivariate time series of length TT which comprises a sequence of state-action pairs:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u03c4={(\\ud835\\udc99t,\\ud835\\udc9at)}t=1T\\\\tau=\\\\{(\\\\boldsymbol{x}_{t},\\\\boldsymbol{y}_{t})\\\\}_{t=1}^{T}\\n\\n(4)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udc99t\\u2208\\u211dNS\\\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{N_{S}}, \\ud835\\udc9at\\u2208\\u211dNA\\\\boldsymbol{y}_{t}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{N_{A}} are the states, actions at time tt respectively. Each trajectory \\u03c4\\\\tau is divided into overlapping windows of length NN, resulting in a set of state and action windows:\\n\\n\\n\\nx(i)=\\\\displaystyle x^{(i)}=\\n[xt,xt+1,\\u2026,xt+N]\\u2208\\u211dN\\u00d7NS\\\\displaystyle[x_{t},x_{t+1},\\\\dots,x_{t+N}]\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\times N_{S}}\\n\\n(5)\\n\\n\\n\\ny(i)=\\\\displaystyle y^{(i)}=\\n[yt,yt+1,\\u2026,yt+N]\\u2208\\u211dN\\u00d7NA\\\\displaystyle[y_{t},y_{t+1},\\\\dots,y_{t+N}]\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\times N_{A}}\\n\\n(6)\\n\\n\\nThe window width NN and latent code dimensionality emerge as tunable parameters for which a trade-off exists between the temporal context afforded to the model, reproduction accuracy and saliency of the latent space. Through preliminary experiments, this was reflected in increased RMS error of the autoencoder reconstructions and reduced average cosine similarity between simulated and real world embeddings with increasing NN and dimensionality respectively. A window size of N=100N=100 samples (2 seconds) was identified as providing the best trade-off between these factors.\\n\\n\\n\\nPolicy adaptation\\n\\nWe adopt a similar approach to our previous work [16] to adapt a pre-trained policy to observations synthesised from unlabelled target domain data. In this procedure, an \\u201cexpert\\u201d policy \\u03c0e\\\\pi_{e} is initially trained in a simulation environment with a physically-informed cutting model, as introduced in our previous work [14], with model parameters from Table Style transfer. The expert was trained initially for 32000 episodes using the proximal policy optimisation (PPO) algorithm with domain randomisation of material properties. A translation function f:\\u211dN\\u00d7NS\\u2192\\u211dN\\u00d7NAf:\\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\times N_{S}}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\times N_{A}} is applied to each state window:\\n\\n\\n\\nx(g,i)\\u2063\\u2217=f\\u200b(x(c,i))x^{(g,i)*}=f(x^{(c,i)})\\n\\n(7)\\n\\n\\nand translated states paired with the corresponding expert action on x(c)x^{(c)} to generate a labelled dataset\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9f={(x(g,i),\\u03c0e\\u200b(x(c,i)))}.\\\\mathcal{D}=\\\\{(x^{(g,i)},\\\\pi_{e}(x^{(c,i)}))\\\\}.\\n\\n(8)\\n\\n\\nWe subsequently train a target domain policy \\u03c0g\\\\pi_{g}, initialised as \\u03c0g=\\u03c0e\\\\pi_{g}=\\\\pi_{e} on \\ud835\\udc9f\\\\mathcal{D} using behavioural cloning. We note this procedure can be extended to alternative imitation learning algorithms (such as DAgger) provided ff can be inferred during generation of source windows x(c,i)x^{(c,i)}. Under the assumption that the environment satisfies the Markov property, the policy learning process is unaffected by the windowing procedure. As the full trajectories do not need to be reconstructed, limitations of other methods such as requirement for blending or enforcing temporal consistency are inapplicable to this work [7]. Furthermore, as each trajectory is decomposed into T\\u2212N+1T-N+1 windows, the windowing approach has the effect of significantly augmenting the training data.\\n\\n\\n\\nStyle transfer\\n\\nIn this work, we consider neural style transfer[11] as a translation function wherein x(g)\\u2063\\u2217x^{(g)*} arise from solving the style transfer optimisation problem:\\n\\n\\n\\nx(g,i)\\u2063\\u2217=arg\\u2061minx(g,i)\\u2061(wc\\u200bLc\\u200b(x,x(c,i))+ws\\u200bLs\\u200b(x,x(s,j)))x^{(g,i)*}=\\\\arg\\\\min_{x^{(g,i)}}\\\\left(w_{c}L_{c}(x,x^{(c,i)})+w_{s}L_{s}(x,x^{(s,j)})\\\\right)\\n\\n(9)\\n\\n\\nwhere wcw_{c} and wsw_{s} are the content and style weights, respectively and LcL_{c}, LsL_{s} are content and style loss contributions respectively. The content loss is defined as:\\n\\n\\n\\nLc=\\u2211l\\u2211i,j12\\u200bNl\\u200b(Fi\\u200bj(c,l)\\u2212Fi\\u200bj(g,l))2L_{c}=\\\\sum_{l}\\\\sum_{i,j}\\\\frac{1}{2N_{l}}\\\\left(F^{(c,l)}_{ij}-F^{(g,l)}_{ij}\\\\right)^{2}\\n\\n(10)\\n\\n\\nwhere F(c,l)F^{(c,l)}, F(g,l)F^{(g,l)} are the feature outputs of layer ll for the content and generated output respectively. The style loss similarly is expressed as\\n\\n\\n\\nLs=\\u2211l\\u2211i,j14\\u200bNl2\\u200bMl2\\u200b(Gi\\u200bj(s,l)\\u2212Gi\\u200bj(g,l))2L_{s}=\\\\sum_{l}\\\\sum_{i,j}\\\\frac{1}{4N^{2}_{l}M^{2}_{l}}\\\\left(G^{(s,l)}_{ij}-G^{(g,l)}_{ij}\\\\right)^{2}\\n\\n(11)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udc06(s,l)\\\\mathbf{G}^{(s,l)} is the style Gram matrix of layer ll outputs F(s,l)F^{(s,l)}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc06(s,l)=F(s,l)\\u200bF\\ud835\\uddb3\\u200b(s,l)\\\\mathbf{G}^{(s,l)}=F^{(s,l)}F^{\\\\mathsf{T}(s,l)}\\n\\n(12)\\n\\n\\nand similarly for \\ud835\\udc06(c,l)\\\\mathbf{G}^{(c,l)}. The generated windows were initialised as\\n\\n\\n\\nx(g,i)=x(c,i)x^{(g,i)}=x^{(c,i)}\\n\\n(13)\\n\\n\\nand (9) optimised by gradient descent using the Adam optimiser. The relative content-style weighting wc/w\\u200bsw_{c}/w{s} was tuned manually through a grid-search procedure. Figure 3 shows the effect of content-style weighting on their relative loss contributions. At low values of wc/w\\u200bsw_{c}/w{s}, the total loss is dominated by increasing content reconstruction error; the generated windows diverge substantially from the original windows with marginal effect on style reconstruction. Hence, wc/w\\u200bsw_{c}/w{s} was reduced until diminishing returns on the (unweighted) style reconstruction loss was observed. We report relevant optimisation parameters in Table Style transfer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 3: Effect of content-style weight ratio wc/wlw_{c}/w_{l} on normalised (unweighted) content-style loss, averaged over 5 content-style batches (batch size 256), with chosen value wc/ws=0.02w_{c}/w_{s}=0.02 indicated (dotted line). Decreasing ratio results in diminishing returns on style while diverging substantially from the original content windows. Increasing ratio tends towards identity (generated windows correspond to unaltered simulated windows).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 1: Selected hyperparameters for encoder network and style transfer framework.\\n\\n\\n\\nParameter\\nValue\\n\\n\\nEncoder learning rate\\n1\\u00d710\\u221231\\\\times 10^{-3}\\n\\n\\nEncoder output channels\\n[128,256,512]\\\\left[128,256,512\\\\right]\\n\\n\\nEncoder kernel size\\n3\\n\\n\\nEncoder batch size\\n128\\n\\n\\nEncoder kernel stride\\n2\\n\\n\\nWindow size\\n100\\n\\n\\nLatent dimensions\\n130\\n\\n\\nContent-style ratio wc/wsw_{c}/w_{s}\\n\\n0.02\\n\\n\\nStyle transfer learning rate\\n0.01\\n\\n\\nStyle transfer iterations\\n1000\\n\\n\\nContent layer indices (Fig. 2)\\n[x]\\n\\n\\nStyle layer indices (Fig. 2)\\n[2, 5, 7]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 4: Convergence plot for style transfer optimisation with parameters from Table Style transfer for a batch of 256 content-style pairings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 2: Table of model parameters for cutting simulation (source domain)\\n\\n\\n\\nParameter\\nValue\\n\\n\\nPitch angle [rad]\\n0.126\\n\\n\\nHelix angle [rad]\\n0.0\\n\\n\\nRadius [m]\\n0.025\\n\\n\\nCutter width [m]\\n0.0005\\n\\n\\nCutting elements (flutes)\\n50\\n\\n\\nSpindle speed [rpm]\\n1000\\n\\n\\nMaterial cutting\\n\\n\\n\\n-mechanistic constant (KcK_{c}) [N/mm2]\\nvariable\\n\\n\\nMaterial edge\\n\\n\\n\\n-mechanistic constant (KeK_{e}) [N/mm]\\nvariable\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 5: t-SNE embedding diagram of content-style pairings. The points are coloured according to their class (simulation, blue / real world, red) with intensity according to the cosine similarity of their closest match, diverging from 0.5. The area of each real world embedding point is directly proportional to the number of times the corresponding window was matched.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA compelling advantage of encoder or classifier-based approaches is that they operate on unpaired cross-domain datasets. To improve the realism of generated trajectories, we employ a pairing mechanism that takes advantage of the unsupervised feature representations learned from the source domain data to generate weakly paired content and style windows. An intuitive analogue would be matching images with similar composition and subjects, reminiscent of the weak paring mechanism in [17]. In the first stage, the real world dataset is encoded in entirety by the encoder network to generate a dataset of embeddings. In the second stage, the simulated content window(s) are encoded and a content-style pairing matrix is constructed by the pairwise cosine similarity between x(c,i)x^{(c,i)}, x(s,j)x^{(s,j)} representations as\\n\\n\\n\\nSi\\u200bj=zi\\u22c5zj\\u2016zi\\u2016\\u22c5\\u2016zj\\u2016S_{ij}=\\\\frac{z_{i}\\\\cdot z_{j}}{||z_{i}||\\\\cdot||z_{j}||}\\n\\n(14)\\n\\n\\nIn the last stage, the closest match real embedding is paired with the simulated embedding. For each row ii, the index of the most similar pairing was obtained by:\\n\\n\\n\\nj\\u2217\\u200bi=arg\\u2061max\\u2061j,Si\\u200bjj^{*}i=\\\\arg\\\\max{j},S_{ij}\\n\\n(15)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor windows where the pairing diverged substantially from the content, the optimisation process introduced mean shifts into the observations, as well as introducing artefacts from the encoding process. Following the intuition of [10], qualitatively, we observed that pre-aligning the means of the content and style windows resulted in higher quality generated outputs. Figure 5 shows a representation of the content-style pairings generated by the pairing procedure. The data show the formation of distinct clusters according to simulated and real world trajectories. Unsurprisingly, the real world embeddings with the most matches were found predominantly at the intersections of the clusters. This parasitic behaviour is reminiscent of the mode-collapse phenomenon in generative-adversarial networks. Nonetheless, around 50% of real world points were matched at least once, with matched windows dispersed throughout the latents, indicating good coverage of the real world dataset.\\n\\n\\nFor adaptation, 50 episodic trajectories were collected in source domain with the expert policy, which formed the content dataset. For this work, the style dataset consisted of 148 off-policy trajectories collected from the real world. We note this is not a hard requirement; dataset size is motivated primarily by avoiding breakdown of the pairing and style transfer mechanism where content and style windows diverge substantially.\\n\\n\\n\\nExperimental setup\\n\\nAs with our previous work, experimental validation was carried out on a KUKA LBR iiwa R820 14kg collaborative robot equipped with a wrist-mounted motorised slitting saw tool. The iiwa was connected via the Fast Research Interface (FRI) to a Robot Operating System (ROS) workstation with a communication frequency of 500Hz. The workstation consisted of an Intel i7-8086K CPU, NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti GPU with 11GB VRAM, and 32GB RAM. The robot was equipped with a motorised slitting saw tool; whereas geometric parameters of the tool reflect the training parameters in Table Style transfer, the number of teeth was doubled to introduce further cross-domain mismatch.\\n\\n\\nThe cutting task was represented as a single conventional milling pass over an material with variable geometry, following a nominal trajectory defined at the material surface. As proof of principle, the reference path was defined manually with respect to the surface for all case studies. During the cutting task, the policy provides as output a translational stiffness, incremental offset to the depth of cut (DoC), and the feed rate, relative to the planned (nominal) trajectory. The nominal feed rate was chosen as 0.75 m/min. The controller damping gain \\ud835\\udc0ad\\\\mathbf{K}_{d} was adjusted independently according to the stiffness to provide a damping ratio of 1.0 (i.e. critically damped). Trajectory tracking was achieved according to the operational space control law\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udeaa=\\ud835\\udc09\\ud835\\uddb3\\u200b[\\u039b^\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc92)\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc0ad\\u200b(t)\\u200b\\ud835\\udc86\\u02d9+\\ud835\\udc0ap\\u200b(t)\\u200b\\ud835\\udc86)+\\ud835\\udf41^\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc92,\\ud835\\udc92\\u02d9)+\\ud835\\udf46^\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc92)]\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Gamma}=\\\\mathbf{J}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}\\\\left[\\\\hat{\\\\Lambda}(\\\\boldsymbol{q})\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{K}_{d}(t)\\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{e}}+\\\\mathbf{K}_{p}(t)\\\\boldsymbol{e}\\\\right)+\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}}(\\\\boldsymbol{q},\\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{q}})+\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\rho}}(\\\\boldsymbol{q})\\\\right]\\n\\n(16)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udeaa\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Gamma} are the commanded joint torques, \\ud835\\udc09\\\\mathbf{J} the robot Jacobian, and \\u039b^\\\\hat{\\\\Lambda}, \\ud835\\udf41^\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}}, \\ud835\\udf46^\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\rho}} are the estimated operational space inertia matrix, Coriolis & centrifugal forces, and gravitational forces respectively.\\n\\n\\nDuring the cutting task, the process force was monitored via an FT-AXIA 80 force-torque sensor, mounted at the robot wrist. However, our method in principle is applicable to different types of sensors, such as those built in to the iiwa, provided real world examples collected with such sensors. Prior to each trial, the force sensor was biased at the start of the trajectory. Force sensor gravity compensation was achieved via the following correction:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc6de\\u200bx\\u200btW=\\ud835\\udc11E\\u200bEW\\u200b\\ud835\\udc6dE\\u200bE+m\\u200bg\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc9b^\\u2212\\ud835\\udc11E\\u200bEW\\u200b\\ud835\\udc11W,0E\\u200bE\\u200b\\ud835\\udc9b^)\\\\boldsymbol{F}^{W}_{ext}=\\\\mathbf{R}_{EE}^{W}\\\\boldsymbol{F}^{EE}+mg\\\\left(\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{z}}-\\\\mathbf{R}_{EE}^{W}\\\\mathbf{R}_{W,0}^{EE}\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{z}}\\\\right)\\n\\n(17)\\n\\n\\nwhere mm is the tool mass, gg is the gravitational acceleration, \\ud835\\udc6de\\u200bx\\u200btW\\\\boldsymbol{F}^{W}_{ext} is the measured external force in the world frame WW, \\ud835\\udc9b^\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{z}} is the z-axis basis vector of WW, and \\ud835\\udc11WE\\u200bE\\\\mathbf{R}_{W}^{EE}, \\ud835\\udc11W,0E\\u200bE\\\\mathbf{R}_{W,0}^{EE} are the world to end-effector (EE) rotations at the current end-effector pose, and bias pose, respectively.\\n\\n\\nFigure 6: Overview of the experimental setup used for real world cutting experiments.\\n\\n\\n\", \"Results\": \"\\nResults\\n\\nIn this section, we evaluate the proposed method in comparison to the unadapted expert policy and state-of-the-art methods based on the previously established experimental setup. To demonstrate the performance of each method on a range of materials, cutting trials were carried out on polyurethane foam, cardboard, corrugated plastic, mica and aluminium. We further establish 3 separate case studies on each material to evaluate the policy performance under different path planning conditions. We evaluate each method by task completion time, average path deviation, average tool load, material removed volume (MRV), and similarity of the adopted action trajectories to the source domain expert actions, averaged over 5 trials per material for each strategy, and aggregated over all materials. To mitigate effects of drift (e.g. tool wear, temperature, calibration errors), trials for each strategy were interleaved.\\n\\n\\nComparison methods\\n\\nFor the subsequent real world experiments, we adopt the following terminology to denote comparison methods: \\u2018Expert\\u2019 refers to the unadapted source simulation expert policy, as transferred directly to the real world task. \\u2018BC\\u2019, or standalone behavioural cloning, represents our previous work, in which the simulation is augmented with a Gaussian process (GP) regression model trained on aligned demonstrations from 14 preliminary experiments on aluminium and mica. \\u2018CVAE\\u2019 represents a conditional variational autoencoder using the same real world dataset as adopted for style transfer. Note in this instance, the encoder itself is trained on the entire dataset of both real world and simulation data, conditioned on a one-hot domain label (simulation or real world). Simulated data are encoded as with the style transfer approach, however, at decoding time, the one-hot class label is swapped to generate a synthetic window of the desired class. \\u2018CycleGAN\\u2019 is also introduced as a comparison method. In this instance, the surrogate real world dataset is synthesised by the sim-to-real generator network. With all methods, the generator / encoder architecture was chosen equivalent to Table Style transfer. For CycleGAN, a smaller discriminator network, with output channels [64,128,256][64,128,256] was used due to mitigate the well-known \\u2018vanishing gradient\\u2019 problem during GAN training. All other hyperparameters were chosen to be equivalent to the CycleGAN study. All methods were employed with behavioural cloning as per the self-supervision procedure introduced in this work. Additionally, as a benchmark, we include a \\u201cbaseline\\u201d strategy in which the process parameters are held constant at the nominal feed rate (0.75m/min) and depth of cut of 1 mm, applied to all materials.\\n\\n\\n\\nPlanar material case study\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) Flat\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) DoC offset\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(c) Curved\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 7: Boxplot summary of performance metrics for the style transfer trained policy and comparison methods, aggregated over all materials. Metrics include task completion time, average path deviation, average load force, average (normalised) dynamic time warping (DTW) distance between each strategy and the simulation expert policy (lower better), and material removed volume (MRV, higher better).\\n\\n\\nEach strategy was initially tested on a planar material, with the reference path calibrated at the material surface. For the calibration procedure, the surface was modelled as a warped plane interpolated between 4 corner points obtained via guarded move with a force threshold of 1N, with the exception of foam, where contact was confirmed visually. The performance of each strategy for the planar case study is outlined in Figure 7(a). To aid interpretation, the significance of the difference in metrics was tested via one-way ANOVA. The normality and homoscedasticity assumptions of ANOVA were tested via the Shapiro-Wilk and Levene methods respectively. A significance level of \\u03b1=0.05\\\\alpha=0.05 was used for all tests. Metrics that did not satisfy the assumptions were transformed via Box-Cox transform:\\n\\n\\n\\ny={x\\u03bb\\u22121if\\u200b\\u03bb\\u22600log\\u2061(x)otherwisey=\\\\begin{cases}x^{\\\\lambda}-1&\\\\mathrm{if}\\\\,\\\\lambda\\\\neq 0\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\log(x)&\\\\mathrm{otherwise}\\\\end{cases}\\n\\n(18)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u03bb\\\\lambda is chosen to maximise the log-likelihood of the transformed data under a normality assumption. In the case of completion time and average force, the assumptions of ANOVA were satisfied (Shapiro p=0.361p=0.361, p=0.355p=0.355; Levene p=0.0689p=0.0689, p=0.0983p=0.0983, respectively). Average path deviation and MRV did not satisfy the normality assumption after transformation, and in this case the Kruskal-Wallis test was adopted without transformation. For both task completion time and average force, one-way ANOVA revealed significant effects of strategy on performance (F=61.1F=61.1, p=1.14\\u00d710\\u221227p=1.14\\\\times 10^{-27}; F=6.74F=6.74, p=6.52\\u00d710\\u22125p=6.52\\\\times 10^{-5} respectively) between strategy and these performance metrics.\\n\\n\\nTo examine the effect of individual strategy on the performance metrics, the Tukey Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) was used for ANOVA, and the Dunn post-hoc test for Kruskal-Wallis. No significant difference in task completion times was found between style transfer and BC, whereas the former outperformed all other methods. Style transfer had the largest effect relative to GAN (\\u22121.00-1.00 s) and the smallest relative to the Expert (\\u22120.329-0.329 s). For path deviation, style transfer significantly differed from the Expert (\\u22121.50-1.50 mm, p=0.000196p=0.000196) and GAN (0.4510.451 mm, p=0.005074p=0.005074) strategies, however, results were inconclusive for BC (p=0.560p=0.560) and CVAE (p=0.109p=0.109). Style transfer was further found to significantly outperform the Expert and BC strategies in minimising average force (\\u22121.273-1.273 N, p=0.0001p=0.0001; \\u22120.651-0.651 N, p=0.0352p=0.0352), however, no significant difference was found between style transfer and the CVAE and GAN strategies (p=0.867p=0.867, p=0.611p=0.611). The choice of strategy was found to have no conclusive effect on MRV (Kruskal H=2.87H=2.87, p=0.578p=0.578). This result appears surprising in light of the differing action selection apparent for each strategy, particularly in DoC.\\n\\n\\nTo examine the effect of the adaptation methods on the agent actions, the actions taken during each trial were compared with 50 simulated experiments (i.e. source domain) carried out with the source domain expert, and the similarity of action trajectories evaluated by normalised dynamic time warping (DTW) distance. The strategies that adopt actions that are more broadly similar to the source domain expert will score lower on this metric than those that deviate substantially from the expert behaviour. The expert policy itself was included in this comparison since it is being applied to the target domain. We report effect sizes as Hedges\\u2019 gg. Clear differences between the strategies were indicated (Kruskal H=1930H=1930, p=0.0p=0.0), with style transfer yielding large improvements relative to the Expert g=0.875g=0.875 and GAN g=2.18g=2.18, a moderate improvement for CVAE g=0.575g=0.575 and a small reduction in performance relative to BC g=\\u22120.370g=-0.370. Post-hoc testing indicated a high significance level in these effects (p\\u22643.65\\u00d710\\u221217p\\\\leq 3.65\\\\times 10^{-17}) for all comparisons.\\n\\n\\nTo examine the behaviour of each strategy in more detail and enable qualitative comparisons between each strategy, the action trajectories adopted by each policy during an example trial on foam and mica are presented in Figure 8. From Figure 8(a), 8(d), 8(g), 8(j), the action trajectories were broadly similar between BC and style transfer across both materials. Style transfer adopts a more correct behaviour of reducing the feed rate prior to engagement with the material, as compared with BC. Conversely, the GAN policy diverges substantially from the expert behaviour which corroborates the DTW metric results. All adapted policies adopted a more consistent DoC throughout both trials than the unadapted expert policy. Differences between the policy behaviour on each material were mainly evident in the DoC behaviour, transverse stiffness (KxK_{x}) and, to a lesser extent, the normal stiffness (KzK_{z}).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFlat\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2005DoC offset\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2002\\u200aCurved\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) Foam - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) Foam - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(c) Foam - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(d) Foam - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(e) Foam - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(f) Foam - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(g) Mica - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(h) Mica - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(i) Mica - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(j) Mica - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(k) Mica - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(l) Mica - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 8: Comparison of agent actions for foam and mica for planar, DoC offset and curved case studies respectively. Actions include the relative to nominal feed rate adjustment, with 0 corresponding to no change and 1 to double the nominal feed rate, depth of cut (DoC), and controller stiffness in transverse, feed direction and normal directions respectively (Kp,xK_{p,x}, Kp,yK_{p,y}, Kp,zK_{p,z}. Units of KpK_{p} are chosen consistent with (16)).\\n\\n\\n\\nRobustness to path planning offset\\n\\nTo examine the robustness of the method to path planning errors - for example, due to errors in calibration, surface position estimation or noise, we further examine the performance of all strategies with a path planning offset of 1mm, inset into the ground truth material surface. The performance of each strategy was evaluated over 3 trials per strategy, per material.\\n\\n\\nSimilarly to the planar case, strategy significantly impacted task completion times (ANOVA F=17.0F=17.0, p=9.94\\u00d710\\u221210p=9.94\\\\times 10^{-10}); style transfer again differed significantly from all strategies except BC (Tukey HSD p=0.0694p=0.0694), and improvements over other strategies being similar to the planar case study, albeit more consistent across strategies (effect size range \\u22120.658-0.658-\\u22120.850-0.850 s). Whereas path deviation was also influenced by strategy (ANOVA F=4.61F=4.61, p=0.00235p=0.00235), post-hoc testing indicated only GAN differed significantly from the BC (p=0.0047p=0.0047) and Expert (p=0.0125p=0.0125) strategies. Although group means were more concentrated than in the planar case, path deviation was notably more consistent across trials for style transfer, CVAE, and GAN, implying these strategies were better able to tolerate the path planning offset and maintain stable path tracking across materials. MRV was again unaffected by strategy (Kruskal-Wallis H=2.61H=2.61, p=0.624p=0.624), and contrasting the planar case study, no significant differences were observed in average tool load (ANOVA F=1.06F=1.06, p=0.382p=0.382). Similarly to the planar case study, there was a clear separation between the strategies in terms of similarity to expert actions (Kruskal H=688H=688, p=9.33\\u00d710\\u2212148p=9.33\\\\times 10^{-148}). Post-hoc testing indicated style transfer was distinct from the comparison methods, with the least significant result being with CVAE (p=0.0314p=0.0314), small negative effects for BC g=\\u22120.321g=-0.321 and CVAE g=\\u22120.151g=-0.151 and positive effects relative to Expert g=0.682g=0.682 and GAN g=1.31g=1.31 strategies.\\n\\n\\nFigure 8(b), 8(e), 8(h), 8(k) shows the agent actions for the offset case study. All strategies exhibited a more sporadic DoC behaviour than the planar case study, with style transfer exhibiting the most consistent DoC behaviour across both materials, and matching more closely to the planar case study behaviour, supporting observations regarding the consistency of the path deviation. All strategies exhibited a more aggressive variation in stiffness relative to the planar case study, indicating a compensatory response to the offset cutting depth.\\n\\n\\n\\nNon-planar surfaces\\n\\nWe further showcase the performance of each strategy when both material and surface geometry are altered to varying degrees of curvature. Consistent with the planar case study, the reference path with respect to the surface was assumed already known; however, we note that numerous path-planning methods have been proposed in the context of milling, including the case where surface geometry is unknown [9]. For this case study, we assume the material is a thin plate under pure bending, with the surface modelled as a section of a truncated oblique cone \\u2013 in other words, an interpolation between two circular arcs. The arc parameters for each endpoint were derived from a 3-point estimation obtained similarly to the planar case study. Curvatures ranged between 2.36 m-1 and 4.04 m-1 across materials. Cardboard was excluded from the set of materials since the maximum curvature generated during preliminary experiments did not meaningfully differ from the previous case studies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) Polyurethane foam\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) Corrugated plastic\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(c) Mica\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(d) Aluminium\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 9: 3D plot of TCP paths adopted by each strategy with respect to the material surface - qualitative defects are shown in the \\u201cexpert\\u201d and \\u201cGAN\\u201d strategies, which exhibit transverse path deviations on the stiffer materials.\\n\\n\\nAs with the prior case studies, strategy had a significant effect on completion time (Kruskal H=38.5H=38.5, p=8.44\\u00d710\\u22128p=8.44\\\\times 10^{-8}) and in post-hoc testing, style transfer outperformed all strategies except BC (p=0.529p=0.529). The effect of style transfer largely reflected the planar case study, with \\u22121.00-1.00 s relative to GAN, and \\u22120.413-0.413 s relative to the Expert. Differences in path deviation were inconclusive compared to the planar case study, (Kruskal H=9.77H=9.77, p=0.0445p=0.0445) with the most significant result from post-hoc testing arising between GAN and style transfer (p=0.0589p=0.0589); however, differences in average force were more pronounced (ANOVA F=7.71F=7.71, p=0.000025p=0.000025), with style transfer significantly outperforming GAN (\\u22121.25-1.25 N, p=0.0001p=0.0001) but not the other strategies. Corroborating the previous case studies, MRV did not significantly differ between strategies (Kruskal H=2.15H=2.15, p=0.708p=0.708). Furthermore, action similarity again revealed clear separation between strategies (Kruskal H=1390H=1390, p=2.64\\u00d710\\u2212300p=2.64\\\\times 10^{-300}), with style transfer exhibiting the largest deviation from GAN (g=2.14g=2.14) and significant differences from all others (BC g=\\u22120.264g=-0.264, CVAE g=0.503g=0.503, Expert g=0.487g=0.487).\\n\\n\\nThe agent actions, as shown in Figure 8(c), 8(f), 8(i), 8(l), show similar behaviours to the offset case study, with differences in DoC behaviour becoming more pronounced, particularly for the expert policy. CycleGAN adopted a highly sporadic action profile in feed rate and stiffness, particularly for the foam trials. A hypothesis for this behaviour is that the curved material presents a more challenging case for the agent and the much lower cutting forces limit information available to the agent to make decisions. Therefore, the actions resemble those at the beginning of the planar trials in which the agent is in free space and has no information about the contact state or tool engagement. Style transfer and BC both exhibited less consistent DoC behaviour than the planar case studies on foam, however, produced smoother action trajectories that were strongly correlated to the engagement state - for example, contact initiation was well-demarcated for both strategies.\\n\\n\\nFigure 9 shows a representative example of the 3D TCP positions adopted by each strategy for a single cutting trial. The TCP trajectories adopted exhibited clear defects for the expert and GAN trials, which were evident across both low and high stiffness materials. On the low stiffness materials, such as in Figure 9(a) these were evident as low-frequency irregularities, resembling a random walk, whereas for the high stiffness materials, this was exhibited as a higher frequency \\u201cwobble\\u201d, which were unrelated to known phenomena such as chattering. These defects were suppressed or entirely absent during the BC, CVAE and style transfer trials, with these methods yielding similar qualitative improvements across all materials.\\n\\n\\n\", \"Discussion\": \"\\nDiscussion\\n\\nFor the cutting task, the proposed method was evaluated based on task completion times, average path deviation, tool load (average force), material removed volume, behavioural similarity to expert action trajectories in source domain, and qualitatively by the action trajectories, ability to maintain consistent cutting conditions (e.g. depth of cut), as well as TCP trajectories. Relative to the comparison methods \\u2013 consisting of the unadapted source domain expert policy (Expert), our previous work (BC), conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) and CycleGAN (generative adversarial network) \\u2013 the proposed method based on style transfer consistently achieved significant reductions in task completion time across all case studies. Compared to BC and CVAE, style transfer showed comparative performance but did not uniformly surpass them across all metrics.\\n\\n\\nThe reduced influence of strategy in the offset path case study is consistent with the constraint imposed by insetting the path into the material, which limits the ability of the agent to regulate the true DoC. It also implies a common limitation of these methods in modelling out-of-distribution task conditions, wherein offsetting the reference path and nominal feed rate introduces concept shift in the optimal actions across domains in addition to covariate shift in the observations. Although path deviation was more consistent across style transfer, CVAE and GAN strategies than for BC and the expert policy, overall improvements were primarily inconclusive. It is plausible that the inconclusive effects may be attributable to the reduced number of samples for the offset case study.\\n\\n\\nQualitatively, the style transfer trained policy demonstrated improved behavioural stability relative to the model-free approaches, with smoother action trajectories and more consistent control of depth-of-cut and stiffness, which was robust to perturbations in surface geometry and cutting path, and corroborated by higher action similarity to the source domain expert relative to all strategies except BC. The irregular path deviations observed in the TCP trajectories were attributable to the largely sporadic action trajectories of the expert policy, and, to a lesser extent, the GAN strategy. For the stiffer materials, deviations in the path are caused by contact instabilities resulting from interaction between the policy stiffness and the environment stiffness. These behaviours were largely absent with the BC, CVAE and style transfer strategies.\\n\\n\\nWe hypothesise that the poorer performance of CycleGAN-based domain adaptation arises from its limited capacity to preserve task-relevant structure in the translated observations, which has been documented in related work [1]. While CycleGAN has been effective in visual domains where semantic content remains invariant under style changes\\u2014e.g. image-to-image translation, its application to time-series control tasks may disrupt temporal dependencies or distort dynamics-critical features, leading to degraded policy performance.\\n\\n\", \"Conclusion\": \"\\nConclusion\\n\\nAn example-based approach for sim-to-real transfer in robotic control was proposed based on the principle of neural style transfer. Empirical results on a robotic cutting task demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable or superior performance to our previous work, conditional variational autoencoders, and CycleGAN-based time series translation across diverse materials and geometric scenarios, while substantially relaxing the assumptions of our previous example-based work. The proposed method is sample-efficient, demonstrated with 148 off-policy real world trajectories versus 32000 for initial policy training, and avoids the need for training domain discriminator, generator or corrective models, a crucial limitation of previously proposed adaptation methods.\\n\\n\\nWe note the limitation that this work does not explicitly address differing cross-domain target (action) distributions or compatibility of generated trajectories with robot kinematic and dynamic constraints. We posit such constraints could be formulated as part of the optimisation process wherein physical feasibility losses are jointly optimised with style and content losses, and represents a possible extension of this work. Additionally, the quality of generated trajectories and pairings is expected to deteriorate with low coverage of real-world examples, weak content-style match similarity, or parasitic matching where a small subset of real trajectories dominate the pairing.\\n\\n\", \"Data availability\": \"\\nData availability\\n\\nThe datasets generated during and/or analysed during the current study are available in the Figshare repository, DOI 10.6084/m9.figshare.28983659.\\n\\n\", \"Funding Declaration\": \"\\nFunding Declaration\\n\\nThis work was supported by the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) project \\u201cResearch and Development of a Highly Automated and Safe Streamlined Process for Increase Lithium-ion Battery Repurposing and Recycling\\u201d (REBELION) under Grant 101104241.\\n\\n\", \"Acknowledgements\": \"\\nAcknowledgements\\n\\nThe authors would further like to acknowledge Abdelaziz Wasfy Shaarawy, Carl Meggs and Christopher Gell respectively for assistance with experimental validation, design of material holder and cutter tool for experiments herein.\\n\\n\", \"Author contributions\": \"\\nAuthor contributions\\n\\nConceptualisation - A.R. and J.H.; data curation - J.H.; formal analysis - J.H.; funding acquisition - A.R. and R.S.; investigation - J.H.; methodology - J.H. and A.R.; project administration - A.R. and R.S.; software - J.H.; resources - J.H., A.R. and R.S.; supervision - A.R. and R.S.; validation - J.H. and A.R.; visualisation - J.H.; writing (original draft) - J.H.; writing (review & editing) - J.H. and A.R. and R.S.\\n\\n\", \"Competing interests\": \"\\nCompeting interests\\n\\nThe authors declare no competing interests.\\n\\n\"}, \"bibliography\": {\"[1]\": \"\\n[1]\\nH.

Finally, the proposed 3D body configuration is refined via stage-wise optimization to ensure physical plausibility and functional correctness. In contrast to existing methods, FunHSI not only synthesizes more plausible general 3D interactions, such as \\\"sitting on a sofa'', while supporting fine-grained functional human-scene interactions, e.g., \\\"increasing the room temperature''.

naturally reason about object functionality, identify the relevant functional element (e.g., a heater knob or thermostat), and interact with it using an appropriate body configuration.\\nHowever, performing such functionally-correct interactions in a novel 3D environment remains challenging for embodied intelligent agents, as it requires a holistic understanding of scene semantics and the human actions that the environment affords\\u00a0[7, 4].\\nIn this work, we investigate to generate realistic and functional interactions between a 3D human body and a novel scene, conditioned on open-vocabulary task descriptions.\\nAn effective solution to this problem benefits a wide range of applications, including embodied AI, robotics, game production, and video generation, among many others.\\n\\n\\nThe synthesis of 3D human-scene interaction (HSI) has been extensively studied, with existing methods broadly falling into two paradigms.\\nData-driven approaches learn generative models from paired 3D interaction data, achieving high visual fidelity and realistic human poses in controlled settings.\\nFor example, COINS\\u00a0[47] models human body poses conditioned on scene geometry and text commands, while TriDi\\u00a0[29] learns a joint distribution over human pose, object geometry, and interaction signals using diffusion models.\\nDespite their effectiveness, such methods rely on large-scale, high-quality paired interaction datasets and typically require explicit interaction specifications (e.g., \\u201csitting on a sofa\\u201d), limiting their ability to generalize to diverse novel scenes.\\nTo alleviate data dependency, recent work has explored zero-shot or training-free pipelines that leverage pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to generate human-scene interactions.\\nRepresentative examples include GenZI\\u00a0[18], which reconstructs 3D human bodies from multi-view image synthesis, and GenHSI\\u00a0[20], which integrates image-based object grounding with 3D body fitting from a single input image.\\nWhile these methods improve flexibility and support open-vocabulary task prompts, they are primarily effective for general human-scene interactions describing physical relations or motions, e.g., \\u201csitting on a sofa\\u201d or \\u201cwalking on a bridge\\u201d.\\n\\n\\nIn contrast, many real-world tasks like \\u201copen the window\\u201d involve interactions at a functional level, where a human must identify and interact with fine-grained functional elements in the 3D scene to complete the task, such as finding and contacting a window handle to open a window, as shown in Fig.\\u00a01.\\nWe refer to this setting as functional human-scene interaction.\\nThis problem poses fundamental challenges, as it requires reasoning about both the semantics of functional elements in 3D scenes and the 3D human poses needed to establish appropriate contacts.\\nExisting methods typically lack explicit reasoning about object functionality and the corresponding human-scene contact, leading to interactions that are either geometrically implausible or functionally incorrect.\\n\\n\\nIn this work, we propose FunHSI, a training-free, functionality-driven\\nframework that enables functional human-scene interactions from\\nopen-vocabulary task prompts.\\nGiven a set of posed RGB-D images and a task prompt, FunHSI reasons about the functionality of the 3D scene and synthesizes a 3D human that interacts with the scene in a functionally correct manner to accomplish the specified task.\\nAs illustrated in Fig.\\u00a02, FunHSI is built upon three key components.\\nFirst, we introduce a functionality-aware contact reasoning module to identify task-relevant functional elements in the scene, reconstruct their 3D geometry, and infer high-level interaction patterns via contact graph reasoning.\\nThe resulting contact graph explicitly encodes the contact relationships between the human body and both functional and supporting scene elements, serving as a structured representation that bridges high-level task intent and low-level physical interaction.\\nSecond, we propose a functionality-aware body initialization module that synthesizes a human performing the task in the image and estimates the corresponding initial 3D body and hand poses.\\nTo mitigate hallucinations during human synthesis, we introduce a human inpainting optimization strategy that automatically evaluates and improves the generated human pose configuration.\\nIn addition, since image-based synthesis may produce left-right

Given a set of posed RGB-D images, and a task prompt, FunHSI generates 3D humans interacting with functional elements (e.g., \\u201cknob\\u201d or \\u201cswitch\\u201d) to perform the specified task. First, functionality-aware contact reasoning detects elements to be interacted with, constructs a contact graph, and performs segmentation. Next, functionality-aware body initialization performs human inpainting, pose estimation, and contact graph refinement, where a generator\\u2013evaluator loop ensures no hallucination and correct contact targeting. Finally, body refinement performs optimization to improve the body configuration and the contact.\\n\\n\", \"3 FunHSI\": \"\\n\\n3 FunHSI\\n\\nAs shown in Fig.\\u00a02, FunHSI takes as input a set of posed RGB-D images and a task prompt, and generates a 3D human performing task-specific interactions with the scene.\\nOverall, FunHSI consists of three key modules.\\nFirst, the functionality-aware contact reasoning module (Sec.\\u00a03.2) identifies task-relevant functional elements in the scene, reconstructs their 3D geometry, and performs contact graph reasoning to produce the high-level interactions.\\nSecond, the functionality-aware body initialization module (Sec.\\u00a03.3) leverages the inferred functional elements and contact relations to synthesize a human in the image and estimate the 3D body and the hand poses.\\nFinally, the body refinement module (Sec.\\u00a03.4) places the initialized 3D body into the 3D scene and performs stage-wise optimization to refine the body and hand poses, and human-scene contacts.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1 Preliminaries\\n\\nWe denote the SMPL-X model\\u00a0[27] as \\u2133\\u200b(\\u03b2,r,\\u03c6,\\u03b8)\\\\mathcal{M}(\\\\beta,r,\\\\varphi,\\\\theta),\\nwhere \\u03b2\\u2208\\u211d10\\\\beta\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{10} denotes the shape parameters,\\nr\\u2208\\u211d3r\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{3} the root translation,\\n\\u03c6\\u2208\\u211d3\\\\varphi\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{3} the root orientation,\\nand \\u03b8=[\\u03b8b,\\u03b8h]\\\\theta=[\\\\theta^{b},\\\\theta^{h}] the pose parameters.\\nHere, \\u03b8b\\u2208\\u211d63\\\\theta^{b}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{63} and \\u03b8h\\u2208\\u211d90\\\\theta^{h}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{90} represent the body and the hand poses, respectively.\\nGiven these body parameters, it can produce a body mesh with 10,475 vertices via forward kinematics (FK).\\nIn addition, the body signed distance field (SDF), denoted as \\u03a8\\u200b(\\u03b2,r,\\u03c6,\\u03b8)\\\\Psi(\\\\beta,r,\\\\varphi,\\\\theta), is computed via VolumetricSMPL\\u00a0[24].\\nSince both \\u2133\\u200b(\\u22c5)\\\\mathcal{M}(\\\\cdot) and \\u03a8\\u200b(\\u22c5)\\\\Psi(\\\\cdot) are differentiable, provided external constraints on the body, inverse kinematics (IK) can be performed via backpropagation to optimize the body parameters and the contacts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2 Functionality-aware Contact Reasoning\\n\\nSince the task prompt typically specifies a high-level goal without explicitly describing which elements to interact with or how the interaction should be carried out, FunHSI must automatically reason about scene functionality, identify task-relevant functional elements, and infer appropriate contact relations with the human body.\\nAccordingly, this module consists of two stages: functionality grounding and reconstruction and LLM-based contact graph reasoning.\\n\\n\\nFunctionality grounding and reconstruction.\\n\\nGiven a task prompt such as \\u201cadjust the temperature\\u201d, we first identify task-relevant functional elements in the RGB images using a vision-language model (VLM).\\nIn our implementation, we employ Gemini-2.5-Flash\\u00a0[2] to infer candidate functional elements conditioned on the task description.\\nBased on the task prompt and the inferred functional elements,\\nwe first localize task-relevant functional elements in the input views and obtain their pixel-level segmentation masks.\\nWe then back-project each posed RGB-D frame into 3D using known camera parameters to reconstruct the scene point cloud, following prior work\\u00a0[28, 4].\\nThe 2D segmentation masks of the functional elements are then back-projected and fused across views to produce 3D masks corresponding to the functional elements.\\n\\n\\n\\nLLM-based contact graph reasoning.\\n\\nWhile the detected functional elements indicate what scene components are relevant to the task, they do not specify how the human body should interact with them, nor how the body is supported by the surrounding scene geometry (e.g., the floor).\\nTo represent human-scene contact relations in a structured form, following prior work\\u00a0[9, 20], we define a property graph:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udca2=(\\ud835\\udcb1,\\u2130),\\ud835\\udcb1=\\ud835\\udcb1body\\u222a\\ud835\\udcb1scene,\\\\mathcal{G}=(\\\\mathcal{V},\\\\mathcal{E}),\\\\quad\\\\mathcal{V}=\\\\mathcal{V}_{\\\\text{body}}\\\\cup\\\\mathcal{V}_{\\\\text{scene}},\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udcb1body\\\\mathcal{V}_{\\\\text{body}} denotes a predefined set of SMPL-X body parts, and\\n\\ud835\\udcb1scene\\\\mathcal{V}_{\\\\text{scene}} denotes functional or supporting scene elements.\\nEach edge (b,o)\\u2208\\u2130(b,o)\\\\in\\\\mathcal{E} encodes a contact relation between a body part b\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb1bodyb\\\\in\\\\mathcal{V}_{\\\\text{body}} and a scene element o\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb1sceneo\\\\in\\\\mathcal{V}_{\\\\text{scene}}.\\nBody-part names are annotated on the SMPL-X template (see Sup. Mat. Fig.\\u00a011) and are fixed across all experiments.\\nWe then prompt a large language model (LLM), e.g., GPT-4o\\u00a0[25] or Gemini, with the task description, the detected functional elements, the predefined body-part set, and additional structured instructions that encourage task-complete and human-like interactions.\\nThe LLM outputs a contact graph \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G}, which specifies the involved body parts, the functional and supporting scene elements, and their corresponding contact relations (see Fig.\\u00a02).\\nSimilar to functional elements, inferred supporting elements (e.g., the floor) are segmented in each image and lifted to 3D masks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3 Functionality-aware Body Initialization\\n\\nAlthough the inferred contact graph \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G} provides high-level interaction constraints, directly fitting a 3D human body to the scene remains challenging due to the strong sensitivity of optimization-based methods to initialization.\\nTo obtain a reliable initial body configuration, we first synthesize a human performing the task in the image and then estimate the corresponding 3D body and hand poses.\\nSince image-based synthesis may introduce left-right inconsistencies with the inferred contact graph, we update the contact graph to align its laterality with the initialized human body.\\n\\n\\nHuman inpainting with contact-aware reasoning.\\n\\nWe employ a vision-language model (VLM), specifically Gemini\\u00a0[2], to synthesize human pixels in the input image.\\nTo encourage the generated human to perform the specified task and establish appropriate contacts with the scene, we introduce a contact-aware prompting strategy.\\nIn addition to the input image without humans and the task description, the inpainting prompt incorporates the inferred contact graph and the detected object bounding boxes.\\nThese cues explicitly specify task-relevant functional and supporting elements, guiding the model to generate human body parts in spatial proximity to the target objects.\\nHowever, image inpainting models may hallucinate, unintentionally altering scene structures or introducing spurious objects, as illustrated in Fig.\\u00a03.\\nTo mitigate this issue, we adopt an iterative generator-critic scheme inspired by LLM-based optimization\\u00a0[40].\\nA separate Gemini model is used as a critic to compare the inpainted image with the original input and verify that (1) the generated human performs the specified task, (2) contacts with functional elements are plausible, and (3) no irrelevant or non-existent objects are introduced.\\nIf any criterion is violated, the generator is prompted to regenerate the human appearance.\\nThis process is repeated until all criteria are satisfied or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\\nIn practice, we find that 3-4 iterations are sufficient and outperform single-pass image generation.\\n\\n\\nFigure 3: Visualization of the human inpainting optimization process. By automatically evaluating the human inpainting results, the image generation process is optimized to produce more reliable outcomes, thus strongly facilitating the subsequent body optimization step.\\n\\n\\n\\n3D human estimation.\\n\\nGiven the human-inpainted image, we estimate SMPL-X parameters to initialize the 3D human body.\\nSpecifically, we estimate the global translation \\ud835\\udc2b\\\\mathbf{r}, root orientation \\ud835\\udf4b\\\\bm{\\\\varphi}, and body pose \\ud835\\udf3db\\\\bm{\\\\theta}^{b} using CameraHMR\\u00a0[26], and estimate hand pose parameters \\ud835\\udf3dh\\\\bm{\\\\theta}^{h} using WiLoR\\u00a0[30].\\nFor cases where the hands are occluded in the image, \\ud835\\udf3dh\\\\bm{\\\\theta}^{h} is initialized to the default relaxed hand pose of SMPL-X.\\nThe estimated SMPL-X body is then transformed from the camera coordinate system to the world coordinate system using the known camera pose, ensuring that the human body and the scene are represented in a common reference frame.\\nThe resulting SMPL-X parameters provide a task-specific and geometrically plausible initialization, which substantially simplifies the subsequent body refinement stage.\\n\\n\\n\\nContact graph refinement.\\n\\nWe observe that image generation models may fail to consistently capture left-right spatial relations.\\nFor example, as shown in Fig\\u00a09, the synthesized image may depict the left hand contacting a handle, even when the inferred contact graph specifies contact with the right hand.\\nSuch laterality inconsistencies between the initialized body configuration and the contact graph can lead to invalid human-scene interactions during subsequent refinement.\\nTo address this issue, we refine the contact graph by aligning its laterality with the inpainted image.\\nSpecifically, we project the left and right wrist joints of the estimated 3D body onto the 2D image plane and compute their distances to the center

and\\n\\ud835\\udc30left,\\ud835\\udc30right\\\\mathbf{w}_{\\\\text{left}},\\\\mathbf{w}_{\\\\text{right}} are the 3D wrist joints.\\nIf dleft>dright+\\u03b4d_{\\\\text{left}}>d_{\\\\text{right}}+\\\\delta, where \\u03b4\\\\delta is a small tolerance to account for projection noise and pose estimation errors, we apply a symmetric left-right swap to all hand-related nodes in the contact graph \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G} (e.g., palm and finger nodes).\\nOtherwise, the contact graph remains unchanged.\\nThis simple distance-based criterion is effective at resolving left-right ambiguities across different scenes and camera viewpoints.\\nThe refined contact graph is denoted as \\ud835\\udca2\\u2217\\\\mathcal{G}^{*}.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4 Optimization-based Body Refinement\\n\\nTo refine the body pose, global configurations, and the contact, a conventional solution is to jointly optimize all SMPL-X parameters.\\nHowever, we find in our trials that such joint optimization often leads to unrealistic HSI results, such as unnatural facing orientation and penetration to the scene.\\nTherefore, we propose a two-stage coarse-to-fine optimization method to gradually refine the initial body state.\\nThis will not only preserve nuances in the initial body pose, but also improve the body-scene contact, making the 3D human body performing the specified task.\\n\\n\\nOptimization objective.\\n\\nTo penalize body-scene interpenetration, we define a collision loss based on the signed distance field (SDF) of the SMPL-X body.\\nGiven a scene point cloud \\ud835\\udcab={\\ud835\\udc29j}j=1N\\\\mathcal{P}=\\\\{\\\\mathbf{p}_{j}\\\\}_{j=1}^{N}, the collision loss is formulated as\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2112col=\\u2211j=1Nmax\\u2061(0,\\u2212\\u03a8\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc29j;\\u03b2,r,\\u03c6,\\u03b8)),\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{col}}=\\\\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\\\max\\\\bigl(0,\\\\;-\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{p}_{j};\\\\beta,r,\\\\varphi,\\\\theta)\\\\bigr),\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n\\nwhere

current SMPL-X body configuration, computed using VolumetricSMPL\\u00a0[24].\\nThis loss penalizes scene points that lie inside the body volume and evaluates to zero when no interpenetration occurs.\\n\\n\\nTo further enforce task-consistent body-scene contact, we introduce a contact loss guided by the refined contact graph \\ud835\\udca2\\u2217\\\\mathcal{G}^{*}.\\nFor each contact pair (b,o)\\u2208\\ud835\\udca2\\u2217(b,o)\\\\in\\\\mathcal{G}^{*}, where bb denotes a body part and oo a corresponding scene element, we minimize the distance between the body vertices

single-sided formulation pulls the body toward the intended contact surfaces without over-constraining the scene geometry.\\nFor foot contacts, the loss is computed only on vertices near the toes and heel, allowing fine-grained poses such as tiptoe standing.\\nTo regularize the pose space during optimization, we incorporate a VPoser prior\\u00a0[27].\\nSpecifically, we define\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2112prior=\\u2016\\ud835\\udc33\\u201622,\\ud835\\udc33=VPoserEnc\\u200b(\\u03b8b),\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{prior}}=\\\\|\\\\,\\\\mathbf{z}\\\\,\\\\|_{2}^{2},\\\\qquad\\\\mathbf{z}=\\\\mathrm{VPoserEnc}(\\\\theta^{b}),\\n\\n(5)\\n\\n\\nwhere

\\u03bbcol\\\\lambda_{\\\\text{col}}, \\u03bbcon\\\\lambda_{\\\\text{con}}, and \\u03bbprior\\\\lambda_{\\\\text{prior}} are scalar weighting coefficients.\\n\\n\\n\\nTwo-stage optimization strategy.\\n\\nAs summarized in Algorithm\\u00a01, the refinement is carried out in two stages.\\nIn the first stage, we optimize the 3D translation rr, the global body orientation around the gravity axis \\u03c6g\\\\varphi_{g}, and the arm pose parameters \\u03b8arm\\\\theta^{\\\\text{arm}}.\\nJointly optimizing the arm articulation and global translation enables the hands to reach and establish contact with the target functional elements specified by the task.\\nTo preserve physical realism, the global orientation is restricted to rotations around the gravity axis, which prevents unnatural body tilting while still allowing feasible interaction configurations and obstacle avoidance.\\nThe second stage focuses on improving physical plausibility and contact stability.\\nIn this stage, we optimize the full body pose \\u03b8\\\\theta together with the 3D translation rr, with particular emphasis on the ankle joints to ensure stable foot-ground contact.\\nA smaller learning rate

The symbol * denotes that the baselines are their modified versions for fair comparison.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvaluation Metrics.\\n\\nWe evaluate HSI synthesis using 4 complementary metrics, i.e. semantic consistency score (SCS), non-collision score (NCS), non-functional contact distance (N-FCD), and functional contact distance (FCD), respectively.\\nThe semantic consistency score measures the alignment between the synthesized 3D interaction and the input text prompt.\\nWe compute a CLIP score\\u00a0[31] by rendering each synthesized interaction into three views, extracting image-text cosine similarities using CLIP ViT-B/32, and averaging the scores across views.\\nFor non-collision score, we compute a non-collision score based on penetration between the SMPL-X body mesh and the reconstructed scene point cloud, following VolumetricSMPL\\u00a0[24].\\nFor non-functional contact distance, we use the average Chamfer distance between the human body mesh and supporting scene elements (e.g., the floor or chair).\\nThe functional contact distance assesses whether the synthesized interaction has appropriate contact with task-relevant functional elements, e.g., a hand touching a door handle in the task of \\u201copen the door\\u201d.\\nThis metric is computed as the Chamfer distance between the functional element region and the interacting human hands.\\n\\n\\n\\nBaselines.\\n\\nTo our knowledge, no existing method explicitly targets functional human-scene interactions in 3D.\\nWe therefore compare our approach with the most closely related baselines.\\nGenZI\\u00a0[18] synthesizes human appearances in individual views and reconstructs a 3D body via multi-view fitting.\\nFor a fair comparison, we adapt GenZI to operate on the same three posed RGB-D images used in our benchmark.\\nGenHSI\\u00a0[20] proposes a training-free pipeline for generating long human-scene interaction videos by combining keyframe planning, 3D-aware inpainting, and motion animation.\\nWe extend GenHSI with functional element detection, perform human inpainting from randomly sampled views, and apply its original body-fitting strategy to our inputs.\\nDue to these adaptations, the resulting baselines are denoted as GenZI* and GenHSI*, respectively.\\n\\n\\nFigure 4: Qualitative results on SceneFun3D for general human-scene interaction.\\nWe compare GenZI*, GenHSI*, and our FunHSI with non-functional prompts such as sitting, squatting, and walking.\\n\\n\\nFigure 5: Qualitative results on SceneFun3D for functional human-scene interaction.\\nGiven open-vocabulary functional commands (e.g., adjusting temperature, dialing a number, switching a radio station) and posed RGB-D inputs, we compare GenZI*, GenHSI*, and our FunHSI.\\nExisting methods struggle to reason about task intent and often interact with incorrect objects or miss fine-grained functional components.\\nIn contrast, FunHSI accurately identifies task-relevant functional elements and generates physically plausible 3D human poses that establish correct contacts with both large objects and small functional parts (e.g., knobs, dials, cabinet handles), demonstrating robust functional grounding and contact reasoning.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.1 Comparison to Baselines\\n\\nQuantitative Evaluation.\\n\\nTable\\u00a01 summarizes the quantitative comparison between our FunHSI method and the modified baselines.\\nOverall, FunHSI performs competitively in the general HSI setting and substantially outperforms the baselines in functional HSI.\\nFor general HSI, FunHSI achieves comparable semantic consistency (0.2498) while improving physical plausibility.\\nIn particular, it attains the lowest contact distance (0.7481), outperforming GenZI* (0.8496) and GenHSI* (0.7599), together with a slightly higher non-collision score (0.9929), indicating that improved contact quality is not achieved at the cost of increased body-scene penetration.\\nFor functional HSI, FunHSI consistently yields the best results, with the lowest functional contact distance (0.2968) and the lowest overall contact distance (0.1837), significantly outperforming GenZI* and GenHSI*.\\nAlthough GenHSI* achieves a marginally higher non-collision score (0.9925 vs. 0.9917), FunHSI maintains comparable physical plausibility and semantic consistency (0.2540).\\n\\n\\nFigure 6: Illustration of functionality awareness of FunHSI.\\nGiven the same 3D scene, FunHSI generates distinct human-scene interactions conditioned on different high-level task prompts.\\n\\n\\nFigure 7: Qualitative results on in-the-wild scenes.\\nWe show our FunHSI results on real-world scenes captured by smart phone in Munich.\\n\\n\\n\\nQualitative Evaluation.\\n\\nFig.\\u00a04 and Fig.\\u00a05 show qualitative comparisons under both general and functional human-scene interaction scenarios.\\nFor functional tasks that require identifying and interacting with task-relevant elements (e.g., operating knobs, opening drawers, or interacting with small appliances), the baseline methods often fail to localize the correct functional targets or produce inaccurate hand-object contacts.\\nIn contrast, FunHSI consistently grounds interactions on the appropriate functional elements and generates realistic human-scene interactions.\\nFor general interaction prompts such as sitting, squatting, or standing near scene objects, FunHSI produces perceptually plausible body poses and interactions, achieving performance comparable to the baseline methods.\\nFig.\\u00a06 further illustrates the functional awareness of FunHSI: given different high-level task prompts abouth the same scene or object, the generated bodies accomplish the intended tasks with diverse and appropriate poses.\\nAdditional visual results are provided in the supplementary material.\\n\\n\\n\\nGeneralization to City Scenes.\\n\\nFig.\\u00a07 presents qualitative results on in-the-wild city scenes captured using a smartphone in public spaces in a city.\\nGiven multi-view RGB images reconstructed into 3D scenes, FunHSI successfully generates plausible human-scene interactions for diverse real-world tasks, such as opening an emergency door, buying a parking ticket, and sitting on a bench.\\nDespite the challenges posed by cluttered environments, noisy geometry, and incomplete reconstructions, our method robustly grounds interactions to the correct functional elements and produces physically plausible body poses.\\nThese results demonstrate that FunHSI generalizes beyond curated indoor datasets and is compatible with real-world feedforward 3D reconstruction pipelines.\\nMore visualizations are provided in Fig.\\u00a012 of the supplementary material.\\n\\n\\nFigure 8: User study of 3D human\\u2013scene interaction synthesis on our curated dataset. Participants show a strong preference for our method over baselines (i.e., GenHSI\\u00a0[20] and GenZI\\u00a0[18]) under both functional and general HSI settings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.2 Perceptual User Study\\n\\nWe conduct a perceptual user study to evaluate the visual quality and interaction realism of synthesized 3D human\\u2013scene interactions.\\nThe study is performed on the SceneFun3D benchmark under both functional HSI and general HSI settings.\\nParticipants are presented with rendered interaction results generated by FunHSI and the baseline methods, and are asked to select the most plausible and realistic human\\u2013scene interaction for each task.\\nThe evaluation focuses on overall perceptual quality, including the appropriateness of body pose, physical plausibility of contact, and consistency with the given task prompt.\\nFig.\\u00a08 summarizes the user preference results.\\nOverall, FunHSI is strongly preferred over the baseline methods across all evaluation settings.\\nWhen taking GenHSI as a representative baseline, FunHSI achieves an overall preference rate of 71.1%.\\nWhen evaluated separately, FunHSI obtains a preference rate of 76.8% for functional HSI and 66.0% for general HSI, indicating a clear advantage in scenarios that require functional reasoning and affordance-aware interaction.\\nMoreover, the preference margins are more pronounced in functional HSI, indicating that users are particularly sensitive to correct functional grounding and realistic contact with task-relevant elements.\\nThese results demonstrate that FunHSI not only improves quantitative metrics, but also produces perceptually more convincing human\\u2013scene interactions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMethod\\nNCS \\u2191\\\\uparrow\\nN-FCD \\u2193\\\\downarrow\\nFCD

physically implausible interactions (red).\\nBy swapping left-right hand to align with the observed contacting hand in the image, our method produces correct and stable human-scene interactions (green).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3 Ablation Studies\\n\\nContact graph refinement.\\n\\nWe ablate the contact graph refinement module by directly using the initial contact graph predicted by the LLM, without aligning left-right relations to the inpainting image.\\nAs shown in Table\\u00a02 and Fig.\\u00a09, removing this refinement leads to degraded contact accuracy, particularly for supporting elements such as the floor, while only marginally affecting the functional distance.\\nThis behavior indicates that ambiguities in left-right correspondence between the contact graph and the generated image can cause failures in the body fitting stage, highlighting the importance of contact graph refinement for stable and accurate interactions.\\n\\n\\n\\nBody & hand pose estimation.\\n\\nWe evaluate the importance of body and hand pose estimation by removing this module from our pipeline and initializing the SMPL-X body with a T-pose prior to refinement.\\nAs shown in Table\\u00a02 and Fig.\\u00a010, this modification leads to consistent degradation across all metrics.\\nThis observation indicates that accurate body and hand pose estimation from the inpainted image plays a critical role in guiding the optimization.\\n\\n\\nFigure 10: Effect of body and hand pose initialization.\\nBody and hand pose initialization provides a consistent starting point, enabling correct hand placement and stable refinement for functional interactions.\\n\\n\\n\\nBody refinement.\\n\\nWe ablate the body refinement stage by directly using the estimated SMPL-X pose without further optimization.\\nAs shown in Table\\u00a02, this results in increased body-scene penetration and less realistic contacts, indicating that the initial pose alone is insufficient to resolve geometric inconsistencies.\\nThese results confirm the necessity of body refinement for producing physically plausible and functionally correct HSI.\\n\\n\\n\\nFunctional element detection.\\n\\nTo evaluate the impact of detection accuracy, we replace the predicted functional element masks with ground-truth annotations (i.e., oracle detection).\\nAs reported in Table\\u00a02, oracle detection leads to a noticeable reduction in functional contact distance (from 0.2968 to 0.2662) while preserving comparable non-collision performance.\\nThis improvement suggests that our generation framework can directly benefit from more robust upstream detection modules.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"5 Conclusion\": \"\\n\\n5 Conclusion\\n\\nIn this work, we studied the problem of functional human-scene interaction synthesis, where a human must reason about object functionality and establish appropriate physical contact to accomplish an open-vocabulary task in a novel 3D scene.\\nWe proposed FunHSI, a training-free and functionality-driven framework that generates 3D human-scene interactions from posed RGB-D observations and open-vocabulary task prompts, without relying on explicit action-object descriptions.\\nBy integrating functionality-aware contact graph reasoning, human initialization, and optimization-based body refinement, FunHSI bridges high-level task intent and physically plausible interaction.\\nExtensive evaluations on a benchmark derived from SceneFun3D show that FunHSI consistently outperforms existing baselines, particularly for functional interactions, while maintaining strong physical plausibility.\\nWe believe FunHSI represents a step toward more semantically grounded human-scene interaction synthesis and opens up future directions for long-horizon and real-world embodied interaction.\\n\\n\\nLimitations and future work.\\n\\nOur method currently focuses on single-step functional human-scene interactions, where a single human pose is synthesized to accomplish a given task.\\nAs a result, it does not explicitly model long-horizon or multi-step interactions that require sequential planning or temporal reasoning across multiple actions (e.g., opening a door and then walking through it).\\nExtending FunHSI to support temporally coherent, multi-step functional interactions remains an interesting direction for future work.\\nIn addition, the scales of city scenes are estimated from RGB images. Unifying the body and the scene scales is also a future work.\\n\\n\\n\", \"Acknowledgement\": \"\\nAcknowledgement\\n\\nWe sincerely thank Alexandros Delitzas and Francis Engelmann for the guidance on SceneFun3D, Priyanka Patel on the guidance of CameraHMR, Muhammed Kocabas for fruitful discussions on foundation models.\\nWe also sincerely thank Nitin Saini and Nathan Bajandas for kind help and explorations on Unreal Engine.

executable contact reasoning, we annotate the SMPL-X body surface using a hierarchical part decomposition.\\nAt the coarse level, we partition the body surface into 15 semantic parts following the SMPL-X template\\u00a0[27]:\\nhead, left upper arm, right upper arm, left forearm, right forearm,\\nleft hand, right hand, back, buttocks,\\nleft thigh, right thigh, left calf, right calf, left foot, and right foot,\\nas illustrated in Fig.\\u00a011.\\nEach part corresponds to a fixed subset of vertices on the SMPL-X mesh, yielding consistent semantic labeling across different poses and body shapes.\\nSince functional interactions in indoor environments are primarily performed by the hands and often involve small-scale objects (e.g., knobs, switches, dials), we further introduce a fine-grained hand annotation.\\nSpecifically, each hand is subdivided into six sub-parts: one palm and five fingers.\\nEach sub-part is associated with a predefined vertex set on the SMPL-X mesh, as shown in Fig.\\u00a011.\\nThis design allows the representation of both whole-hand contacts (e.g., palm-handle) and finger-level functional interactions (e.g., index finger-button) without introducing unnecessary anatomical complexity.\\nThis hierarchical annotation plays a dual role in our pipeline.\\nFirst, it provides a structured and semantically grounded vocabulary for LLM-based contact graph reasoning, enabling the model to express contacts using interpretable body-part names (e.g., \\u201cleft index finger touches the switch\\u201d).\\nSecond, it establishes a direct mapping from contact semantics to geometric constraints: each contact node bb in the contact graph is mapped to its corresponding vertex set \\ud835\\udcb1b\\\\mathcal{V}_{b}, which is used to compute contact losses during body refinement.\\nBy grounding language-level contact reasoning in mesh-level geometry, this annotation enables precise functional interactions while maintaining physical plausibility.\\n\\n\", \"Appendix B Datasets Details\": \"\\n\\nAppendix B Datasets Details\\n\\nIndoor scenes from SceneFun3D\\u00a0[4].\\n\\nTo systematically evaluate both prior methods and our approach for human-scene interaction (HSI) synthesis under fair and controlled settings, we construct a new benchmark derived from the SceneFun3D dataset.\\nWe select 30 indoor scenes covering diverse spatial layouts and functional contexts, including living rooms, bedrooms, kitchens, and bathrooms.\\nAll scenes contain common household objects that afford human interaction, such as doors, drawers, cabinets, switches, radiators, and supporting furniture.\\nFor each scene, we provide three canonical RGB-D views captured from different viewpoints, where each view consists of an RGB image, a depth image, and pixel-level mask annotations for key affordance-bearing elements (e.g., door handles, knobs, floors, and supporting surfaces).\\nUsing known camera parameters, the three views are back-projected and fused into a unified 3D point cloud, which serves as the geometric input for all interaction synthesis methods.\\nFor each scene, we manually define two types of interaction settings: functional human-scene interaction (functional HSI) and non-functional human-scene interaction (general HSI).\\nFunctional HSI requires the human to interact with a specific functional element to accomplish a task objective (e.g., open the door, adjust the room temperature, dial a number on the telephone), while non-functional HSI involves generic body-scene interactions that do not rely on object functionality (e.g., sit on the floor, stand in front of the window).\\nEach interaction setting is paired with a single text prompt per scene, resulting in a total of 60 curated interaction tasks (30 functional and 30 non-functional).\\nThe functional interaction prompts are designed to cover a diverse range of manipulation affordances, including pinch_pull, hook_pull, tip_push, rotate, plug_in, unplug, and key_press.\\nMost tasks involve fine-grained hand-object interactions, intentionally emphasizing functional reasoning and precise contact modeling rather than coarse body placement alone.\\nAll methods are evaluated on the same set of scenes, views, and text prompts without additional training or scene-specific tuning.\\nThe reconstructed scene geometry and affordance annotations are reused across different interaction prompts within each scene to ensure consistent and fair comparison.\\n\\n\\n\\nReal-world city scenes.\\n\\nTo evaluate the generalization ability of FunHSI under open-world conditions, we additionally collect a set of real-world city scenes captured in public environments.\\nAll data are captured using an iPhone 14 Pro Max. For each scene, we take multiple RGB images from different viewpoints. We use GeoCalib\\u00a0[36] to estimate the camera intrinsic parameters and the gravity direction, and use MapAnything\\u00a0[15] to estimate the camera poses, the depth maps, and the 3D scene point cloud.\\n\\n\\nThe collected scenes include diverse outdoor and semi-outdoor environments such as building entrances, staircases, ticket machines, escalators, benches, and public facilities, featuring challenging factors including clutter, reflective surfaces, varying illumination, and unconstrained object layouts.\\nWe apply the same processing pipeline as in indoor scenes without any scene-specific tuning.\\nThis experimental setting allows us to assess whether FunHSI can generalize beyond curated indoor datasets and reliably synthesize function-aware human-scene interactions in real-world, unconstrained environments.\\n\\n\\n\", \"Appendix C Implementation Details\": \"\\n\\nAppendix C Implementation Details\\n\\nAll our experiments are conducted on a single NVIDIA A6000

FunHSI on real-world scenes captured in public environments.\\nThese scenes exhibit significantly higher visual and geometric complexity than indoor datasets, including cluttered backgrounds, irregular lighting conditions, reflective surfaces, and diverse object appearances.\\nGiven three posed RGB-D views and a task-level text prompt, FunHSI successfully synthesizes functionally appropriate human-scene interactions without scene-specific tuning.\\nAs shown in the figure, our method correctly identifies task-relevant functional elements and generates plausible interactions for a wide range of actions, such as taking escalators or elevators, buying tickets from vending machines, opening doors, pinning objects to a whiteboard, and interacting with urban furniture.\\nThese results demonstrate that FunHSI generalizes beyond curated indoor datasets and is capable of handling open-world scenes while preserving functional grounding, contact correctness, and physical plausibility.\\n\\n\\n\\nGeneration Diversity.\\n\\nFig.\\u00a013 illustrates the diversity of human-scene interactions generated by FunHSI under the same scene and task prompt.\\nFor each example, we visualize multiple valid 3D human poses that differ in body configuration, viewpoint, and spatial arrangement, while consistently preserving the intended functional contact.\\nSpecifically, FunHSI produces diverse interaction realizations for tasks such as opening a drawer, dialing a telephone, and opening a door, all of which maintain correct contact with the task-relevant functional elements.\\nThese variations arise from differences in initial image synthesis and subsequent geometric refinement, rather than changes in task specification.\\nThis result demonstrates that FunHSI does not collapse to a single canonical pose, but instead supports diverse yet functionally consistent human-scene interaction generation.\\n\\n\\n\\nHuman Inpainting Examples.\\n\\nFig.\\u00a03 presents representative examples of task-conditioned human inpainting in our pipeline.\\nGiven an input RGB image and a task-level functional prompt, the inpainting model synthesizes a human that is spatially consistent with the scene layout and roughly aligned with the intended interaction region.\\nImportantly, the inpainted humans already reflect coarse functional intent (e.g., reaching, crouching, or bending), providing a semantically meaningful and visually grounded initialization that reduces ambiguity in subsequent 3D reconstruction.\\n\\n\\n\\nBody and Hand Pose Estimation Examples.\\n\\nBased on the inpainted images in Fig.\\u00a03, we estimate the initial 3D SMPL-X body pose together with articulated hand poses.\\nThe estimated poses capture coarse body configuration and hand-object alignment in image space, including which hand is used and its approximate contact location.\\nThese estimates serve as strong initialization for our geometry-aware body refinement, significantly improving optimization stability, accelerating convergence, and reducing failure cases such as incorrect hand assignment or implausible body configurations.\\n\\n\\nFigure 15: \\nLayout

These results suggest that offline knowledge construction provides a practical and scalable foundation for reliable autonomous scientific discovery.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20833v1\", \"timestamp\": 1769625114, \"sections\": {\"1 Introduction\": \"\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nAs research increasingly moves toward fully autonomous scientific discovery, large language model (LLM)-based agents have attracted growing attention for their ability to automate complex research workflows (chai2025scimaster; cornelio_combining_2023; wang2023scientific; xu_artificial_2021). Recent systems  (lu2024aiscientist; yamada2025aiscientistv2; gottweis_towards_2025) demonstrate that LLM-based agents can autonomously execute an end-to-end research loop, including literature review, code generation, experiment execution, and manuscript drafting. These results suggest that automated scientific discovery is becoming practically feasible and that LLM-based agents are approaching a level of functional completeness required for autonomous research (jin_agentreview_2024; sahu_reviewertoo_2025; ajith2024litsearch; zhang_noveltybench_2025; zhang2026opennovelty).\\n\\n\\nDespite this progress, existing systems remain constrained by a fundamental inefficiency in their execution paradigm, which limits their scalability and robustness in practice. In particular, most current research agents (wang_openhands_2025; yang_swe-agent_2024; mitchener_kosmos_2025; luo2025llm4sr) rely on an on-the-spot computation strategy, where nearly all information acquisition, reasoning, and synthesis are performed online at runtime. Under this paradigm, each new research attempt requires the agent to dynamically retrieve large volumes of scientific literature, read and summarize long and heterogeneous documents in real time, and explore a broad space of candidate methods and experimental designs through open-ended generation and trial-and-error. As a result, the cost of producing a single effective scientific discovery remains substantial. For example, a complete execution of the overall pipeline often requires several hours and, in some cases, up to 15 hours to progress from ideation to experimentation (lu2024aiscientist). Similarly, in (schmidgall_agent_2025), literature review and experimental planning alone account for a significant portion of total inference time and place heavy demands on the language model\\u2019s ability to maintain coherent reasoning over long contexts. More importantly, this runtime-centric design repeatedly forces the model to re-process large volumes of unstructured and partially redundant information, even when much of the underlying scientific knowledge is already well established, thereby increasing computational overhead and exacerbating the risk of hallucination and reasoning errors (wang2025repomaster; shin_mind_2025).\\n\\n\\nTo address the efficiency and reliability limitations of existing autonomous research agents, we propose Idea2Story, a scientific discovery framework that explicitly separates offline knowledge construction from online research generation, with the goal of reducing repeated reasoning over scientific literature and alleviating the context window bottleneck of large language models. Most current systems rely on runtime-centric execution, where agents repeatedly retrieve, read, summarize, and reason over large collections of highly overlapping papers for each new research attempt, resulting in substantial computational cost and prolonged execution time. Idea2Story mitigates this inefficiency by shifting literature understanding from online reasoning to an offline stage. In the offline phase, the system periodically collects recently accepted, peer-reviewed papers together with their full review feedback, extracts core methodological units and research patterns, and organizes these units and their observed composition relations into a continuously updated structured knowledge graph. This knowledge graph serves as a compact and reusable representation of established scientific methods and their empirical compatibility, replacing repeated processing of raw documents at runtime. Building on this offline knowledge infrastructure, Idea2Story performs online research generation by aligning underspecified user research intents with existing research paradigms encoded in the knowledge graph. Rather than relying on open-ended generation and trial-and-error, the system retrieves high-quality research patterns as structured compositions of method units, which act as stable methodological blueprints for downstream experimental design and execution. Guided by these validated research patterns, Idea2Story conducts feasibility-driven experimentation and ultimately generates a complete, submission-ready paper in an end-to-end manner.\\n\\n\\nFigure 1:  Overview of the two-stage framework in Idea2Story. The offline stage constructs a structured knowledge graph by extracting and organizing reusable method units from a curated paper corpus. The online stage retrieves and composes research patterns from the knowledge graph to ground underspecified user intent into concrete and coherent research directions.\\n\\n\\nOur work makes the following contributions to autonomous scientific discovery :\\n(1) We introduce Idea2Story, a framework that formalizes autonomous research as a\\npre-computation\\u2013driven process, where scientific knowledge is extracted, structured, and\\nmaintained in a continuously updated methodological knowledge graph, addressing the inefficiency and\\nunreliability of runtime-centric research agents. (2) We propose a knowledge-grounded planning and execution pipeline that alleviates the context window bottleneck and reduces repeated runtime reasoning over literature by converting paper reading into retrieval over a pre-built knowledge graph. (3) We conduct preliminary empirical studies and comparative evaluations, demonstrating that Idea2Story can produce several high-quality research demos and establishing the practical feasibility of the proposed paradigm in an end-to-end setting.\\n\\n\", \"2 Related Work\": \"\\n\\n2 Related Work\\n\\n\\n2.1 Autonomous Scientific Discovery\\n\\nRecent advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven growing interest in autonomous scientific\\ndiscovery agents that aim to automate the full research lifecycle, from code generation to experimental\\nexecution  (hu_controlled_2026; zhang2025evolving; lin_se-agent_2025). Early systems such as The AI Scientist (v1) (lu2024aiscientist) demonstrate the\\nviability of end-to-end automation but rely heavily on manually crafted code templates and largely\\nlinear exploration workflows, which restrict discovery depth and adaptability. Later approaches, including\\nThe AI Scientist-v2 (yamada2025aiscientistv2) and Kosmos (mitchener_kosmos_2025), reduce reliance on\\nexplicit template through the incorporation of agentic tree search and experiment management agents, enabling iterative and multi-round exploration.\\n\\n\\nIn research ideation, LLM-generated ideas are often perceived as highly novel during initial screening; however, prior studies (si2024can) uncover a critical paradox whereby such ideas tend to underperform after implementation relative to human-generated ideas, indicating limited feasibility and practical\\nutility. As more ideas are generated, LLM outputs exhibit growing similarity, leading to diminished meaningful diversity. Similar limitations have also been observed in research evaluation and peer\\nreview (liang2024can; xu2025can; thakkar_can_2025; zhang2026opennovelty). Existing AI-based reviewers display systematic blind\\nspots: shin_mind_2025 shows that LLM reviewers place disproportionate\\nemphasis on technical correctness while undervaluing novelty, deviating from human\\nexpert judgment, while sahu_reviewertoo_2025 demonstrates that AI reviewers\\nstruggle to distinguish fine-grained acceptance categories and are susceptible to sycophancy, with\\nreview scores increasing unreasonably after exposure to author rebuttals. Although recent approaches\\nsuch as AgentReview (jin_agentreview_2024) seek to mitigate these deficiencies by simulating\\ndiverse reviewer roles, automated evaluation systems remain less reliable than human experts in\\nidentifying robust accept/reject decision boundaries.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2.2 LLM-Driven Agents\\n\\nLLM-driven agents still struggle to interact effectively with complex real-world environments.\\nDespite their strong generative capabilities, many existing systems\\u2014such as OpenHands (wang_openhands_2025)\\nand SWE-Agent (yang_swe-agent_2024)\\u2014exhibit limited performance when applied to realistic\\ncodebases. These limitations largely stem from insufficient reasoning over hierarchical dependencies\\nand structural constraints, as well as the inherent restrictions imposed by finite context windows.\\nAs a result, LLM-driven agents achieve relatively low task completion rates on challenging benchmarks\\nsuch as MLE-bench (chan_mlebench_2024) and SciCode (tian_scicode_2024).\\nRepoMaster (wang2025repomaster) further identifies inadequate modeling of codebase structure,\\nincluding function call graphs and module dependency graphs, as a key bottleneck for LLM-driven agents\\noperating in large and complex environments.\\n\\n\\nBeyond execution limitations, LLM-driven agents also exhibit notable deficiencies in scientific rigor\\nand evaluative judgment. When tasked with autonomous assessment, these agents are prone to hallucination and overconfidence. For instance, Agent Laboratory (schmidgall_agent_2025) reports that automated evaluations produced by LLM-driven agents substantially overestimate paper quality compared to human reviewers. Evaluations of Kosmos (mitchener_kosmos_2025) further reveal a tendency to invent opaque quantitative metrics and to conflate statistical significance with scientific value, leading to weak interpretability of experimental conclusions. Moreover, long-horizon autonomous execution exacerbates these issues by introducing behavioral\\ndrift (arike2025tech), where LLM-driven agents gradually deviate from intended research trajectories or generate overly strong and insufficiently justified claims (lu2024aiscientist; schmidgall2025agent; baek_researchagent_2025; hong_metagpt_2023; wu_autogen_2023; lin_se-agent_2025; hu_controlled_2026). This drift further undermines reliability and highlights the\\nneed for stronger structural grounding and validation mechanisms in LLM-based autonomous research\\nsystems.\\n\\n\\n\", \"3 General Idea Generation\": \"\\n\\n3 General Idea Generation\\n\\nIdea2Story is designed to interact with users through high-level and often informal research ideas\\nthat reflect human intuition rather than fully specified technical plans. The system transforms\\nsuch underspecified inputs into structured and academically grounded research directions through\\na two-stage paradigm that separates offline knowledge construction from online research generation:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nOffline Knowledge Construction.\\nIn the offline stage, Idea2Story builds a reusable methodological foundation from existing\\nscientific literature. This includes curating a large-scale paper pool from peer-reviewed\\nvenues, extracting reusable method units that capture core methodological contributions, and\\norganizing these units into a structured knowledge graph that encodes their semantic and\\ncompositional relations. The resulting knowledge graph serves as a persistent repository of\\nmethodological abstractions, decoupling literature understanding from runtime reasoning.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nOnline Research Generation.\\nIn the online stage, Idea2Story grounds user-provided research ideas through retrieval and\\ncomposition over the pre-built knowledge graph.

These instantiated patterns are\\nfurther refined through a review-guided process that iteratively evaluates and revises them with\\nrespect to novelty, methodological soundness, and conceptual coherence. The refined research\\npatterns then serve as structured blueprints for subsequent planning, feasibility-driven\\nexperimentation, and end-to-end paper generation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1 Offline Knowledge Construction\\n\\nThe offline knowledge construction stage aims to distill reusable methodological structure from\\nexisting scientific literature and to organize it in a form that can be efficiently accessed during\\nonline research generation. Instead of performing document-level reasoning at runtime, Idea2Story\\npre-computes a structured representation of prior work that captures both methodological\\nabstractions and their observed compatibility in accepted research. This stage consists of three\\nmain components: (i) constructing a curated paper pool from peer-reviewed venues, (ii) extracting\\ncore method units that represent reusable methodological contributions, and (iii) organizing these\\nunits and their composition relations into a structured knowledge graph. Together, these components\\nform a persistent methodological memory that decouples literature understanding from downstream\\nidea grounding and research generation.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1.1 Paper Pool Construction\\n\\nWe construct a paper pool from accepted machine learning papers and their associated peer reviews\\ncollected from top-tier conferences. Let \\ud835\\udc9e={NeurIPS,ICLR}\\\\mathcal{C}=\\\\{\\\\text{NeurIPS},\\\\text{ICLR}\\\\} denote the\\nset of venues considered, and let \\ud835\\udcaf\\\\mathcal{T} denote the most recent three-year time window.\\nThe resulting paper pool is defined as\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udcab={p\\u2223p\\u200b\\u00a0is an accepted paper from\\u00a0\\u200bc\\u2208\\ud835\\udc9e\\u200b\\u00a0during\\u00a0\\u200b\\ud835\\udcaf},\\\\mathcal{P}=\\\\{\\\\,p\\\\mid p\\\\text{ is an accepted paper from }c\\\\in\\\\mathcal{C}\\\\text{ during }\\\\mathcal{T}\\\\,\\\\},\\n\\n\\n\\nwhich consists of approximately 5,000 papers from NeurIPS and 8,000 papers from ICLR.

Formally, we model method unit extraction as a mapping\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2130:p~\\u2192\\ud835\\udcb0p={up(1),\\u2026,up(Kp)},\\\\mathcal{E}:\\\\tilde{p}\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathcal{U}_{p}=\\\\{u_{p}^{(1)},\\\\dots,u_{p}^{(K_{p})}\\\\},\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere p~\\u2208\\ud835\\udcab~\\\\tilde{p}\\\\in\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}} denotes a single paper and \\ud835\\udcb0p\\\\mathcal{U}_{p} is a small set\\nof method units that capture its essential technical ideas.\\n\\n\\nAs illustrated in Figure 2, the extraction procedure leverages the standardized structure of\\nacademic papers and analyzes different sections to collect complementary methodological signals.\\nLet \\ud835\\udc31p=(introp,methodp,expp)\\\\mathbf{x}_{p}=(\\\\text{intro}_{p},\\\\text{method}_{p},\\\\text{exp}_{p}) denote the partition of a paper\\ninto its introduction, method, and experiments sections. The introduction is used to identify the\\nhigh-level research motivation and the precise problem formulation, the method section provides\\nsignals about core technical mechanisms such as modeling assumptions, learning objectives, model\\narchitectures, and optimization strategies, and the experiments section reflects how these\\nmechanisms are instantiated and evaluated in practice. By jointly aggregating information from\\nthese sections, the extractor isolates method units that correspond to the primary algorithmic or\\nmodeling contributions of the paper, rather than surface-level experimental details.\\n\\n\\nWe define a method unit u\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb0pu\\\\in\\\\mathcal{U}_{p} as a self-contained description of how a research\\nproblem is formulated or solved, abstracted away from specific implementation choices and\\nexperimental configurations. Elements that primarily involve dataset selection, hyperparameter\\ntuning, or engineering-level optimizations are excluded unless they induce substantive changes to\\nthe problem formulation, model structure, or learning objective. In practice, most papers yield one\\nor a small number of method units. Each extracted unit is further normalized into structured\\nmethodological attributes, including atomic meta-methods, which correspond to indivisible\\nmethodological elements, and composition-level patterns, which describe how multiple method\\nunits are combined within a single paper.\\n\\n\\nAfter extracting method units for all papers, we represent each paper p\\u2208\\ud835\\udcab~p\\\\in\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}}\\nby a vector embedding derived from its associated method units. Formally, let\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc33p=g\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb0p),\\\\mathbf{z}_{p}=g(\\\\mathcal{U}_{p}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udcb0p\\\\mathcal{U}_{p} denotes the set of extracted method units for paper pp and\\ng\\u200b(\\u22c5)g(\\\\cdot) is an embedding function that maps a set of method units to a fixed-dimensional\\nrepresentation.\\n\\n\\nTo induce higher-level research patterns, we first apply a nonlinear dimensionality reduction\\noperator\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc32p=UMAP\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc33p),\\\\mathbf{y}_{p}=\\\\mathrm{UMAP}(\\\\mathbf{z}_{p}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhich projects the high-dimensional embeddings into a lower-dimensional space while preserving\\nlocal semantic neighborhoods. We then perform density-based clustering on the reduced\\nrepresentations using DBSCAN, yielding a partition\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9e={C1,\\u2026,CM},\\\\mathcal{C}=\\\\{C_{1},\\\\dots,C_{M}\\\\},\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere each cluster Cm\\u2282\\ud835\\udcab~C_{m}\\\\subset\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}} corresponds to a coherent research pattern.\\n\\n\\nThese induced clusters serve as higher-level abstractions over individual papers, capturing\\nrecurring methodological structures that are reused across the literature. The resulting research\\npatterns form the basis for subsequent retrieval and composition.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2:  Offline knowledge graph construction in Idea2Story. Academic papers and their associated review artifacts are first anonymized and safety-filtered, then deconstructed into layered methodological representations. These layers capture complementary aspects of a paper, including its core research idea, domain context, high-level story skeleton, and packaging actions. The extracted elements are normalized into atomic method units and meta-methods, which are connected through composition and similarity relations. Reviewer feedback is incorporated as additional signals to refine relations and validate abstractions. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1.3 Knowledge Graph Construction\\n\\nBuilding on the extracted method units, we organize reusable methodological components into a\\nstructured knowledge graph that supports systematic method discovery and composition. While\\nindividual method units capture isolated algorithmic or modeling ideas, effective research methods\\nin practice typically arise from structured combinations of multiple method units. The knowledge\\ngraph provides a unified representation that explicitly encodes canonicalized method units,\\nmeta-methods, and their empirically observed composition relations in prior work.\\n\\n\\nFormally, we define the knowledge graph as a directed graph\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udca2=(\\ud835\\udcb1,\\u2130),\\\\mathcal{G}=(\\\\mathcal{V},\\\\mathcal{E}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere each node v\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb1v\\\\in\\\\mathcal{V} corresponds to a canonicalized method unit or a meta-method.\\nCanonicalization groups semantically similar method units across the corpus into shared\\nmeta-method abstractions, reducing surface-level variation while preserving core methodological\\nintent. As a result, nodes in the graph represent atomic or minimally indivisible methodological\\nelements that are reused across papers.\\n\\n\\nEdges in the graph encode composition relations between method units. For a given paper\\np\\u2208\\ud835\\udcab~p\\\\in\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}} with extracted method unit set \\ud835\\udcb0p\\\\mathcal{U}_{p}, we add directed edges\\nbetween pairs of method units (ui,uj)\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb0p\\u00d7\\ud835\\udcb0p(u_{i},u_{j})\\\\in\\\\mathcal{U}_{p}\\\\times\\\\mathcal{U}_{p} to indicate that\\nthey are jointly instantiated as part of the same methodological pipeline. These edges capture\\nempirical evidence of method compatibility observed in prior work, reflecting how different\\nmethod units are combined in practice rather than hypothetical or manually specified relations.\\n\\n\\nAggregating composition relations across the full corpus yields a graph structure that encodes both\\nmethodological abstraction and empirical compatibility. In particular, the graph captures two\\ncomplementary levels of structure: (i) reusable methodological elements represented as\\ncanonicalized method units and meta-methods, and (ii) composition constraints induced from\\nco-occurrence statistics in accepted papers. This separation allows Idea2Story to reason about\\nmethods at a higher level of abstraction than individual papers, while remaining grounded in\\nobserved research practice.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2 Online Research Generation.\\n\\nGiven a target research objective, Idea2Story treats method discovery as a graph-based retrieval and\\ncomposition problem over \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G}. The system retrieves relevant subgraphs and composes\\ncompatible method units by following connectivity constraints in the graph, producing candidate\\nresearch patterns that correspond to structured combinations of method units. These research\\npatterns serve as high-level methodological blueprints that bridge abstract research intent and\\nconcrete experimental design, enabling downstream planning, feasibility analysis, and end-to-end\\npaper generation.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2.1 Research Pattern Retrieval\\n\\nGiven a user-provided research idea expressed in natural language, we formulate research pattern\\nidentification as a structured retrieval problem over the knowledge graph \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G}. Let\\nqq denote the input research idea, and let \\ud835\\udc9e={C1,\\u2026,CM}\\\\mathcal{C}=\\\\{C_{1},\\\\dots,C_{M}\\\\} denote the set of\\nresearch patterns induced from the paper corpus. The goal is to rank patterns in \\ud835\\udc9e\\\\mathcal{C}\\naccording to their relevance to qq.\\n\\n\\nRather than relying on a single similarity metric, Idea2Story adopts a multi-view retrieval\\nformulation that aggregates complementary signals from different semantic abstractions. Formally,\\nfor each research pattern CmC_{m}, we compute a relevance score\\n\\n\\n\\ns\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)=\\u2211v\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb1\\u03bbv\\u200bsv\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q),s(C_{m}\\\\mid q)=\\\\sum_{v\\\\in\\\\mathcal{V}}\\\\lambda_{v}\\\\,s_{v}(C_{m}\\\\mid q),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udcb1={idea,domain,paper}\\\\mathcal{V}=\\\\{\\\\text{idea},\\\\text{domain},\\\\text{paper}\\\\} indexes the retrieval views,\\nsv\\u200b(\\u22c5)s_{v}(\\\\cdot) denotes a view-specific scoring function, and \\u03bbv\\\\lambda_{v} are fixed weighting\\ncoefficients that balance the contribution of different views.\\n\\n\\nIdea-level retrieval.\\n\\nAt the idea level, the system retrieves previously observed research ideas that are semantically\\nsimilar to the input query qq. Let \\u2110\\\\mathcal{I} denote the set of stored research ideas extracted\\nfrom the corpus, and let simidea\\u200b(q,i)\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{idea}}(q,i) denote a semantic similarity function\\nbetween qq and an idea i\\u2208\\u2110i\\\\in\\\\mathcal{I}. The idea-level score of a research pattern CmC_{m} is\\ncomputed by aggregating the similarity scores of ideas associated with the pattern:\\n\\n\\n\\nsidea\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)=maxi\\u2208\\u2110\\u200b(Cm)\\u2061simidea\\u200b(q,i),s_{\\\\text{idea}}(C_{m}\\\\mid q)=\\\\max_{i\\\\in\\\\mathcal{I}(C_{m})}\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{idea}}(q,i),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u2110\\u200b(Cm)\\\\mathcal{I}(C_{m}) denotes the set of ideas linked to pattern CmC_{m}.\\n\\n\\n\\nDomain-level retrieval.\\n\\nAt the domain level, the system interprets the input idea qq in terms of its underlying research\\ndomains and methodological themes. Let \\ud835\\udc9f\\\\mathcal{D} denote the set of research domains, and let\\nsimdomain\\u200b(q,d)\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{domain}}(q,d) measure the relevance between qq and domain d\\u2208\\ud835\\udc9fd\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}.\\nThe domain-level score of pattern CmC_{m} is computed as\\n\\n\\n\\nsdomain\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)=\\u2211d\\u2208\\ud835\\udc9f\\u200b(Cm)simdomain\\u200b(q,d)\\u200bw\\u200b(d,Cm),s_{\\\\text{domain}}(C_{m}\\\\mid q)=\\\\sum_{d\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}(C_{m})}\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{domain}}(q,d)\\\\,w(d,C_{m}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udc9f\\u200b(Cm)\\\\mathcal{D}(C_{m}) denotes the domains associated with pattern CmC_{m}, and w\\u200b(d,Cm)w(d,C_{m}) captures\\nempirical effectiveness signals derived from the knowledge graph.\\n\\n\\n\\nPaper-level retrieval.\\n\\nAt the paper level, the system retrieves papers whose technical content is semantically aligned\\nwith the input idea. Let \\ud835\\udcab\\u200b(Cm)\\\\mathcal{P}(C_{m}) denote the set of papers instantiating pattern CmC_{m}.\\nThe paper-level score is computed as\\n\\n\\n\\nspaper\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)=maxp\\u2208\\ud835\\udcab\\u200b(Cm)\\u2061simpaper\\u200b(q,p)\\u22c5\\u03b1\\u200b(p),s_{\\\\text{paper}}(C_{m}\\\\mid q)=\\\\max_{p\\\\in\\\\mathcal{P}(C_{m})}\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{paper}}(q,p)\\\\cdot\\\\alpha(p),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere simpaper\\u200b(q,p)\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{paper}}(q,p) measures semantic similarity between qq and paper pp,\\nand \\u03b1\\u200b(p)\\\\alpha(p) denotes a quality-related weight derived from peer review metadata.\\n\\n\\nThe final ranked list of research patterns is obtained by ordering patterns according to their\\naggregated multi-view relevance scores. Formally, we define\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9e\\u2217\\u200b(q)=RankCm\\u2208\\ud835\\udc9e\\u2061(\\u2211v\\u2208{idea,domain,paper}\\u03bbv\\u200bsv\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)),\\\\mathcal{C}^{*}(q)=\\\\operatorname{Rank}_{C_{m}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{C}}\\\\left(\\\\sum_{v\\\\in\\\\{\\\\text{idea},\\\\text{domain},\\\\text{paper}\\\\}}\\\\lambda_{v}\\\\,s_{v}(C_{m}\\\\mid q)\\\\right),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere patterns are sorted in descending order of the aggregated score.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2.2 Review-Guided Refinement\\n\\nAfter candidate research patterns are retrieved, Idea2Story refines them using an explicit\\nLLM-based review loop. In each iteration, a large language model is prompted to act as a reviewer\\nand evaluate the current research pattern along several predefined criteria, including technical\\nsoundness, novelty with respect to existing literature, and overall clarity of the problem\\u2013method\\nalignment. The reviewer produces both scalar judgments and concrete revision suggestions.\\n\\n\\nThe system then uses this feedback to update the research pattern in a targeted manner. When the\\nreview indicates insufficient novelty, the system modifies the pattern by recombining compatible\\nmethod units or introducing alternative realizations within the same pattern family. When the\\nreview identifies issues in feasibility or ambiguity in formulation, the system revises the problem\\ndefinition or method structure to improve consistency and executability. Each revised pattern is\\nre-submitted to the same review process, forming an explicit generate\\u2013review\\u2013revise loop.\\n\\n\\nTo prevent uncontrolled drift, only revisions that improve the reviewer scores are retained;\\notherwise, the system rolls back to the previous version. This process repeats until the reviewer\\njudges the pattern to be sufficiently novel, coherent, and technically plausible, or until further\\niterations no longer yield improvement. The output of this stage is a refined research pattern that\\nhas been iteratively vetted by an LLM-based reviewer and is suitable for downstream validation and\\npaper generation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"4 Experiments and Analysis\": \"\\n\\n4 Experiments and Analysis\\n\\nWe evaluate Idea2Story through a set of experiments focusing on its ability to extract reusable\\nmethodological structure and to generate high-quality research patterns from ambiguous user input.\\nOur experiments are conducted on a corpus of accepted papers from ICLR and NeurIPS over the past\\nthree years, including approximately 13K papers and their associated peer reviews, which serves as\\nthe foundation for all subsequent analyses. Based on this corpus, we first analyze the properties of the extracted method units to assess whether Idea2Story captures meaningful and reusable methodological abstractions. We then present qualitative demonstrations of research patterns instantiated as structured research stories, illustrating how the system transforms vague research intent into coherent and methodologically grounded research directions.\\n\\n\\n\\nCase 1: Method Unit Extraction Demo\\n\\n\\nPaper Title:\\nLearning Dynamics of LLM Finetuning\\nBase Problem:\\nUnderstanding how specific training examples influence model predictions during finetuning is challenging, particularly in large language models.\\nSolution Pattern:\\nDevelop a framework to analyze step-wise influence accumulation among potential responses during finetuning, providing insights into phenomena like hallucination and the squeezing effect in off-policy direct preference optimization.\\nStory:\\nReframe the understanding of LLM finetuning through the lens of learning dynamics, offering a unified interpretation of training behaviors and inspiring methods to enhance model alignment and performance.\\nApplication:\\nImproving alignment in large language models, enhancing finetuning strategies for better model performance, diagnosing and mitigating hallucination in AI systems.\\n\\nFigure 3: An example of a method unit extracted from an accepted paper, illustrating the separation of the base problem, solution pattern, and higher-level research story.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.1 Implementation Details\\n\\nTo further assess the effectiveness of Idea2Story in practical research ideation settings, we\\nconduct additional qualitative experiments on a small set of representative cases. Specifically,\\nwe evaluate three user-provided research ideas curated by an external collaborator. For each case,\\nIdea2Story generates research patterns using the GLM-4.7 (zeng2025glm) model as the underlying language backbone. As a baseline, we compare against direct LLM generation, where the same model is prompted to produce a complete research story without explicit pattern modeling or retrieval.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.2 Case Study: Method Unit Extraction\\n\\nWe present a representative case study to illustrate the behavior of the proposed method unit\\nextraction agent. Case 1 shows an example extracted from an accepted paper, where the system decomposes the full paper into a structured set of methodological elements.\\n\\n\\nAs shown in the example, the extracted method unit explicitly separates the underlying research\\nproblem, the core solution pattern, and the resulting research story. The Base Problem describes the core challenge addressed by the paper, namely understanding how individual training examples influence model behavior during finetuning, without depending on specific datasets or implementation details. The Solution Pattern summarizes the central methodological idea as\\nan analysis framework for step-wise influence accumulation, highlighting the key mechanism without\\nbinding it to a particular optimization setup or experimental configuration. Importantly, the extracted Story reframes the technical contribution at a higher level of\\nabstraction, connecting learning dynamics to broader phenomena such as hallucination and alignment\\nin large language models. This abstraction reflects how the method unit goes beyond algorithmic\\ndetails to capture the conceptual contribution of the paper. Finally, the Application\\nfield grounds the method unit by indicating downstream research and system-level implications,\\nwithout enumerating task-specific benchmarks.\\n\\n\\nThis example demonstrates that the extraction agent isolates reusable methodological structure while\\nfiltering out implementation-level details. By representing the paper as a coherent method unit\\nrather than a collection of experimental components, Idea2Story enables subsequent reuse,\\ncomparison, and composition of methodological ideas across papers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3 Knowledge Graph Analysis\\n\\nWe analyze the structure of the constructed knowledge graph to understand how extracted method\\nunits are distributed across papers and research domains. As illustrated in Figure 2, the graph\\nexhibits a clear hub-and-spoke structure, where a small number of high-frequency domains connect\\nto a large number of papers and research patterns. This reflects the uneven distribution of\\nresearch activity across domains, while also highlighting domains that function as central hubs\\nfor methodological reuse. Importantly, many research patterns are observed to connect multiple\\ndomains simultaneously, indicating that the extracted method units often capture methodological\\nabstractions that generalize beyond a single application area. In contrast, paper-level nodes are typically associated with a single domain, whereas pattern-level nodes frequently act as bridges between otherwise weakly connected domains. This structural separation suggests that the knowledge graph encodes two distinct levels of organization\\u2014instance-level\\n\\nFigure 4: Visualization of the knowledge graph substructure induced by high-frequency research\\ndomains.\\n\\n\\nresearch artifacts and reusable methodological abstractions\\u2014enabling Idea2Story to retrieve and compose research patterns at a higher level of abstraction rather than relying on domain-specific or paper-specific similarity alone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAspect\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIdea2Story Generated (IntentDiff)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLLM Direct Generated (EcoIntent)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTitle\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIntentDiff: Reframing E-commerce Intent Classification via Structural Evolution and Context-Aware Diffusion\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEcoIntent: A Context-Aware Multi-Granularity Agent for E-commerce Intent Understanding via Hierarchical Contrastive Learning\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbstract Focus\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReinterprets intent classification as a structural evolution process rather than static text classification. The approach leverages a diffusion-based framework to iteratively refine noisy query representations into precise intent labels, integrates product graph embeddings to ground predictions in e-commerce context, and introduces a discrete, context-aware tokenizer to handle long-tail domain vocabulary.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTargets improved intent classification performance by integrating heterogeneous behavioral context and hierarchical product knowledge.

User queries are short, ambiguous, and heavily dependent on implicit catalog structure, which fixed-label classification fails to capture. Intent understanding is modeled as an evolving process under structural constraints.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFormulates intent understanding as a conventional multi-class classification problem, where the input is a query augmented with session context and the output is an intent label from a predefined set.

Experimental outcomes can then serve as additional signals to refine the instantiated research stories, forming a feedback loop between method design and empirical validation. Beyond experimentation, future work may further explore how refined research patterns can be systematically translated into complete paper drafts, covering method descriptions, experimental results, and discussion sections.

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [18] and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [9] have achieved high-fidelity rendering, with 3DGS in particular becoming the mainstream choice for its real-time rendering capability. However, both methods require densely captured training images, which are often difficult to obtain, and they tend to produce artifacts at extrapolated viewpoints, namely those outside the interpolation range of the training views. These limitations hinder their use in downstream applications such as autonomous driving simulation and free-viewpoint user experiences.\\n\\n\\nRecent work has explored addressing artifacts in extrapolated view rendering with 3DGS. Existing approaches fall into two categories: adding regularization terms during training or augmenting supervision views using generative models. The regularization terms are often derived from 3D priors [48, 52, 10, 50, 32], or additional sensors [21], but they are typically hand-crafted and limited to specific scene types. Moreover, their lack of hallucination capability further restricts their applicability.\\nIn leveraging diffusion models (DMs), some approaches fine-tune them with paired data, e.g., by using sparse LiDAR inputs or extrapolated renderings with artifacts to generate refined images. Many of these methods train on domain-specific datasets, such as those for autonomous driving [41, 36, 20, 35], which inevitably compromises the generalization ability of DMs. More recently, Difix3D+ [37] fine-tunes SD Turbo [25] on a wider range of 3D datasets, improving generalization. However, the substantial effort required to curate 3D data and the high fine-tuning cost make this approach time-consuming and expensive to extend to other DMs.\\nAn alternative line of work seeks to improve extrapolated rendering without fine-tuning, typically by providing extrapolated renderings as guidance during the denoising step. This preserves the generalization capacity of DMs trained on large-scale data, but such methods still lag behind fine-tuned approaches that are specifically adapted to the task.\\n\\n\\nGiven the generalization\\u2013fidelity trade-off, we ask: can extrapolated view rendering be improved with DMs without sacrificing generalization? To address this challenge, we focus on fine-tuning-free methods and enhance their effectiveness for NVS extrapolation. This is achieved with our proposed 2D\\u20133D interleaved refinement strategy combined with per-pixel confidence guidance for fine-tuning-free image refinement. Specifically, given a trained 3DGS, we sample an extrapolated viewpoint, render the 2D image, refine it with a 2D image diffusion model (IDMs), and integrate the refined image back into the 3D scene by updating the 3DGS before proceeding to the next viewpoint.\\nThis interleaved 2D-3D refinement ensures that previously enhanced views inform subsequent 2D refinements and improve multi-view consistency. Importantly, we introduce a confidence-guided 2D refinement, where a per-pixel confidence map rendered from the 3DGS highlights regions requiring further improvement by the 2D DM. This contrasts with previous training-free methods that rely solely on rendering opacity, leaving the DM to identify artifact regions on its own. While our confidence guidance could in principle be applied to video diffusion models (VDMs), advanced video backbones are typically more computationally expensive and use temporal down-sampling, which prevents the direct use of per-pixel guidance. We show that our 2D\\u20133D interleaved optimization strategy achieves consistent refined images without relying on VDMs.\\n\\n\\nOur contribution can be summarized as follows: 1) We propose a simple yet effective approach for enhancing extrapolated 3DGS rendering without the need for fine-tuning DMs, featuring a 2D\\u20133D interleaved refinement strategy and per-pixel confidence guidance. 2) Our method is compatible with various DMs and preserves generalization across diverse scene contents. 3) Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing fine-tuning-free methods and achieves comparable or even superior performance to training-based methods.\\n\\n\", \"2 Related Work\": \"\\n\\n2 Related Work\\n\\nNumerous works have made efforts on improving quality of NVS. In this section, we will discuss related works in NVS and 3D reconstruction. Furthermore, we will explore efforts that improve NVS quality by incorporating priors from geometry, physics or generative models.\\n\\n\\nNovel View Synthesis: \\nNVS aims to generate photorealistic images of a scene from novel viewpoints. Early methods primarily relied on traditional image-based rendering techniques, such as Light Field Rendering [14], Image-Based Rendering [28], and Multi-Plane Image [55, 30]. These approaches typically interpolate between existing views and are often limited by dense input imagery and struggle with complex occlusions. The advent of deep learning revolutionized NVS, led by two major paradigms: NeRF [18] and 3DGS [9]. NeRF implicitly represents a scene and achieves high-quality results, but its training and rendering speeds are slow. In contrast, 3DGS offers rapid training and real-time rendering. However, a significant limitation of 3DGS is the occurrence of visual artifacts in extrapolated views, which are viewpoints far from the training data. These artifacts compromise the realism and geometric fidelity of the synthesized images. Mitigating these artifacts is the focus of this paper.\\n\\n\\nNVS with Geometry Priors: \\nTo enhance the robustness of NVS models and reduce reconstruction ambiguity, many works have introduced geometry priors. These priors provide key information about the scene\\u2019s 3D structure, which can be explicitly provided by external sensors like LiDAR or depth cameras [21, 41, 36, 23, 40, 17, 8]. Other methods utilize strong structural priors often found in real-world scenes, such as the assumption that the ground is a flat plane [52, 10, 5], the sky can be modeled as a dome [4, 43], or that walls and tables in indoor scenes are predominantly orthogonal [48]. These structural assumptions help regularize the reconstruction process. While these geometry priors can mitigate some reconstruction challenges, they often fall short of completely solving the artifact problem in extrapolated views, especially when the initial geometric prior is itself inaccurate.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: Method. FreeFix improves the rendering quality of extrapolated views in 3DGS without fine-tuning DMs, as illustrated in the bottom left of the pipeline. We propose an interleaved strategy that combines 2D and 3D refinement to utilize image diffusion models for generating multi-frame consistent results, as shown at the top of the pipeline. In the 2D refinement stage, we also introduce confidence guidance and overall guidance to enhance the quality and consistency of the denoising results.\\n\\n\\nNVS with Generative Priors: \\nGenerative priors leverage pre-trained generative models to assist NVS tasks, particularly when dealing with data scarcity or missing information. Early works explored using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to improve rendering quality [39, 24, 26], where the GAN\\u2019s discriminator ensured the local realism of synthesized images. More recently, DMs [33, 22, 13, 31, 42, 11, 12, 34] have gained prominence for their powerful generative capabilities. Their application in NVS falls into two main categories. The first involves fine-tuning a pre-trained DM, which has learned powerful priors from datasets [37, 41, 35, 38, 54, 49, 47]. This process adapts the model\\u2019s knowledge to scene-specific appearances but can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. The second category, which aligns with our proposed method, leverages a pre-trained DM as a zero-shot prior without fine-tuning. The key challenge here is determining what part of the rendered image should be used as guidance for the DM, and how to maintain multi-view consistency. Using the opacity channel of the rendered image as guidance is a common but often crude solution [45, 16, 46], as areas with high opacity can still be artifacts. Additionally, ensuring consistency across different novel views using IDMs is a critical problem. While VDMs [33, 31, 42, 11] can inherently handle this, they are often computationally heavy and not suitable for all applications.\\n\\n\", \"3 Method\": \"\\n\\n3 Method\\n\\nThe FreeFix pipeline is illustrated in Fig.\\u00a02.

VDMs are widely used for improving 3DGS [9] because of the inherent capability to apply attention across frames, ensuring multi-frame consistency. However, the temporal attention mechanism also introduces a computational burden,\\nwhich also limits the output length of VDMs, as the computation complexity is quadratic in relation to the sequence length. Furthermore, recent advanced VDMs [42, 11, 31] utilize 3D VAE as their encoder and decoder, which performs temporal down-sampling, making it challenging to apply per-pixel confidence guidance.\\n\\n\\nDue to the above reasons, we select IDMs as the backbone in FreeFix. However, most existing IDMs are not designed for the novel view synthesis task and do not take reference views as input. IP-Adapter [44] accepts image prompts as input, but it is intended for style prompts rather than novel view synthesis. Directly applying IDMs can lead to inconsistency across frames and finally result in blurriness in refined 3DGS. To tackle the problem, we propose an interleaved refining strategy, multi-level confidence guidance, and overall guidance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3 Interleaved Refinement Strategy\\n\\n2D Refinement: \\nAs mentioned in Sec.\\u00a03.1, the trajectory of extrapolated views \\ud835\\udcafext={\\ud835\\udcb10e,\\ud835\\udcb11e,\\u2026,\\ud835\\udcb1me}\\\\mathcal{T}_{\\\\textit{ext}}=\\\\{\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{0},\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{1},...,\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{m}\\\\} in our task definition is intended to be continuous. This continuous trajectory setting ensures that adjacent views \\ud835\\udcb1ie\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i} and \\ud835\\udcb1i+1e\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i+1} undergo only small transformations. A naive approach to keep consistency would be warping pixels from \\ud835\\udcb1ie\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i} to \\ud835\\udcb1i+1e\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i+1} and using DMs for inpainting. However, both rendered depth and predicted depth are not reliable for warping. Instead, we propose an interleaved refining strategy to enhance multi-view consistency.\\n\\n\\nSpecifically, the refining process is interleaved and incremental along the trajectory \\ud835\\udcaf\\\\mathcal{T}. Given the current view \\ud835\\udcb1ie\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i}, the current 3DGS \\ud835\\udca2i\\u22121\\\\mathcal{G}_{i-1} and rendered image \\u2110^ie=\\u03c0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb1ie;\\ud835\\udca2i\\u22121)\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e}_{i}=\\\\pi(\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i};\\\\mathcal{G}_{i-1}), we utilize denoising with guidance, as discussed in Sec.\\u00a03.4, to obtain the fixed image \\u2110^ie,f\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{i}. We also maintain a fixed image set \\u2131i\\u22121={(\\ud835\\udcb10e,\\u2110^0e,f),(\\ud835\\udcb11e,\\u2110^1e,f),\\u2026,(\\ud835\\udcb1i\\u22121e,\\u2110^i\\u22121e,f)}\\\\mathcal{F}_{i-1}=\\\\{(\\\\mathcal{V}_{0}^{e},\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{0}),(\\\\mathcal{V}_{1}^{e},\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{1}),...,(\\\\mathcal{V}_{i-1}^{e},\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{i-1})\\\\}. We refine the current 3DGS \\ud835\\udca2i\\u22121\\\\mathcal{G}_{i-1} to \\ud835\\udca2i\\\\mathcal{G}_{i} by using the training set \\ud835\\udcaet\\u200br\\u200ba\\u200bi\\u200bn\\\\mathcal{S}_{train}, the previous refined view set \\u2131i\\u22121\\\\mathcal{F}_{i-1} and the current refined image \\u2110^ie,f\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{i}.\\n\\n\\n3D Refinement: \\nThe supervision during 3D Refinement for \\ud835\\udca2i\\\\mathcal{G}_{i} comes from current refined view (\\ud835\\udcb1ie,\\u2110^ie,f)(\\\\mathcal{V}_{i}^{e},\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{i}), \\u2131i\\u22121\\\\mathcal{F}_{i-1} and St\\u200br\\u200ba\\u200bi\\u200bnS_{train}. The detailed sampling strategy for training is illustrated in the supplements.\\n\\n\\nThe generated results do not guarantee 3D consistency with training views, so we employ a smaller training loss for the generated views to prevent inaccurately generated areas from distorting 3D scenes. Additionally, the generated results exhibit slightly color bias compared to training views, which are often difficult for humans to distinguish. However, when applying the interleaved refining strategy, these slight color biases will accumulate, which may lead to a blurry and over-gray effect. We implement a simple yet efficient technique similar to [53] to tackle the problem. For each generated view, we define two optimizable affine matrices \\ud835\\udc9cf\\u2208\\u211d3\\u00d73\\\\mathcal{A}_{f}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{3\\\\times 3} and \\ud835\\udc9cb\\u2208\\u211d3\\u00d71\\\\mathcal{A}_{b}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{3\\\\times 1}.

FreeFix employs multiple \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} to obtain multi-level certainty masks as guidance. Each level of mask guides a different stage of denoising. A small \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} with high overall certainty is used for the early stages of denoising, while a large \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} which offers greater accuracy, is applied during the later stages of denoising.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4 Denoising with Guidance\\n\\nGiven the rendered results of an extrapolated view, even though the image contains artifacts, most areas can still be regarded as photo-realistic rendering results. These regions with relatively high fidelity can provide essential information for generating an image free of artifacts, while maintaining almost the same content.\\n\\n\\nExperiments in Difix3D+ [37] have demonstrated that adding noise to images with artifacts and directly applying denoising using DMs can effectively remove these artifacts; however, the strength of the added noise is quite sensitive. For regions with significant artifacts, a larger scale of noise is needed to repaint those areas, while a smaller scale of noise is sufficient for areas with minimal artifacts. Although it may seem intuitive to apply different levels of noise to different regions, this approach does not align the data distribution of DMs. Instead, employing guidance during the diffusion denoising step is more practical and has been widely adopted in [16, 45].\\n\\n\\nConfidence Map: \\nUtilizing appropriate guidance is an effective method for generating high-fidelity images while preserving accurate rendering results. However, current approaches that use warp masks or rendering opacities as guidance weights do not account for the presence of artifacts. For example, as illustrated in Fig.\\u00a03 (a), even when severe artifacts are present, the rendering opacities remain high, indicating that these artifacts continue to act as strong guidance during the denoising process.\\nTo tackle this issue, we propose utilizing confidence masks as guidance weights, as shown in Fig.\\u00a03 (c). The confidence scores are derived from Fisher information, which is also referenced in [7, 6]. Specifically, Fisher information measures the amount of information that the observation (x,y)(x,y) carries about the unknown parameters ww that model pf\\u200b(y|x;w)p_{f}(y|x;w). In the context of novel view synthesis, Fisher information can be defined as:\\n\\n\\n\\npf\\u200b(\\u03c0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)|\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)p_{f}(\\\\pi(\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})|\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})\\n\\n(5)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udcb1\\\\mathcal{V} and \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G} represent viewpoint and 3DGS respectively, while \\u03c0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)\\\\pi(\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}) denotes the volume rendering results at the specific view \\ud835\\udcb1\\\\mathcal{V}.\\n\\n\\nThe negative log likelihood of Fisher information in Eq.\\u00a05, which serves as the uncertainty \\ud835\\udc9e\\u00af\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{\\\\bar{C}}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}} of \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G} at view \\ud835\\udcb1\\\\mathcal{V}, can be approximately derived as a Hessian matrix, the detailed derivation can be found in the supplementary materials:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9e\\u00af\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\\\displaystyle\\\\mathcal{\\\\bar{C}}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}\\n=\\u2212log\\u2061pf\\u200b(\\u03c0|\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)\\\\displaystyle=-\\\\log p_{f}(\\\\pi|\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n=\\ud835\\udc07\\u2032\\u2032\\u200b[\\u03c0|\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2]\\\\displaystyle=\\\\mathbf{H}^{{}^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}}[\\\\pi|\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n=\\u2207\\ud835\\udca2\\u03c0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)T\\u200b\\u2207\\ud835\\udca2\\u03c0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)\\\\displaystyle=\\\\nabla_{\\\\mathcal{G}}\\\\pi(\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})^{T}\\\\nabla_{\\\\mathcal{G}}\\\\pi(\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})\\n\\n(6)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[7, 6] renders the attribute \\ud835\\udc9e\\u00af\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{\\\\bar{C}}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}} in volume rendering to obtain the uncertainty map. However, uncertainty is not a numerically stable representation, as its value can range from [0,+\\u221e)[0,+\\\\infty). As illustrated in Fig.\\u00a03 (b), the numeric instability of uncertainty may render an inaccurate uncertainty map. This often occurs when there are Gaussians with low opacity and high uncertainty, which can overwhelm the volume rendering. Instead, we use the complementary value as guidance, certainty \\ud835\\udc9e\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}, also referred to as confidence in this paper, which has a stable numeric range of [0,1][0,1].\\nThe certainty \\ud835\\udc9e\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\u03b3c\\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}^{\\\\gamma_{c}} is defined as:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9e\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\u03b3c=exp\\u2061[\\u2212\\u03b3c\\u200b\\ud835\\udc9e\\u00af\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2]\\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}^{\\\\gamma_{c}}=\\\\exp[-\\\\gamma_{c}\\\\mathcal{\\\\bar{C}}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}]\\n\\n(7)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} is a hyperparameter.

The larger the value of \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c}, the more sensitive the rendered confidence map becomes to artifacts. Selecting a single appropriate \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} is not trivial. Therefore, we apply multi-level confidence maps as guidance. Since DMs generate a coarse structure of image rather than detailed appearance in the early denoising stages [27], we provide \\u2133\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\u03b3c\\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}^{\\\\gamma_{c}} with a small \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} to offer more comprehensive guidance. In the later denoising stages, DMs tend to generate detailed appearances, so we provide \\u2133\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\u03b3c\\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}^{\\\\gamma_{c}} with a large \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} to ensure that the guidance is sufficiently accurate.\\n\\n\\nConfidence Guidance: \\nGiven the rendered image I^\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\\\hat{I}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}} and the corresponding confidence map \\u2133\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\u03b3c\\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}^{\\\\gamma_{c}}, we can provide denoising guidance to DMs.\\nWe denote the rendered image after VAE encoding as x0rx_{0}^{r}, and the resized confidence map that aligns with the shape of the latent space as \\u2133c\\\\mathcal{M}^{c}. As illustrated in Eq.\\u00a02, the predicted x0tx_{0}^{t} at tt timestep is given by xt\\u2212\\u03c3t\\u200b\\ud835\\udd3d\\u03b8\\u200b(xt,t)x_{t}-\\\\sigma_{t}\\\\mathbb{F}_{\\\\theta}(x_{t},t). We guide the model prediction as x0t,gx_{0}^{t,g} by blending the rendered image using confidence mask:\\n\\n\\n\\nx0t,g=\\u2133c\\u2299x0r+(1\\u2212\\u2133c)\\u2299x0tx_{0}^{t,g}=\\\\mathcal{M}^{c}\\\\odot x_{0}^{r}+(1-\\\\mathcal{M}^{c})\\\\odot x_{0}^{t}\\n\\n(9)\\n\\n\\nHowever, the input for the next denoising step cannot be directly obtained using Eq.\\u00a03 since the model prediction x0tx_{0}^{t} has been changed. Instead, we derive the new xt\\u22121x_{t-1} by solving the following equations:\\n\\n\\n\\nxt\\u22121\\\\displaystyle x_{t-1}\\n=x0+\\u03c3t\\u22121\\u200b\\ud835\\udd3d\\u03b8\\u200b(xt,t)\\\\displaystyle=x_{0}+\\\\sigma_{t-1}\\\\mathbb{F}_{\\\\theta}(x_{t},t)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nxt\\u22121\\\\displaystyle x_{t-1}\\n=xt+(\\u03c3t\\u22121\\u2212\\u03c3t)\\u200b\\ud835\\udd3d\\u03b8\\u200b(xt,t)\\\\displaystyle=x_{t}+(\\\\sigma_{t-1}-\\\\sigma_{t})\\\\mathbb{F}_{\\\\theta}(x_{t},t)\\n\\n(10)\\n\\n\\nThe representation of xt\\u22121x_{t-1} derived from x0t,gx_{0}^{t,g} and xtx_{t} is:\\n\\n\\n\\nxt\\u22121=\\u03c3t\\u22121\\u03c3t\\u200bxt\\u2212\\u03c3t\\u22121\\u2212\\u03c3t\\u03c3t\\u200bx0t,gx_{t-1}=\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{t-1}}{\\\\sigma_{t}}x_{t}-\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{t-1}-\\\\sigma_{t}}{\\\\sigma_{t}}x_{0}^{t,g}\\n\\n(11)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOverall Guidance: \\nAlthough the interleaved refining strategy provides higher fidelity rendering results and ensures that the rendering is more consistent with the generated content, using IDMs may still encounter issues of inconsistency in areas with low confidence. Particularly in regions with weak textures like ground and sky, the confidence map tends to be low, and allowing denoising to proceed freely in these areas can result in high inconsistency and blurriness in 3DGS. To address this issue, we propose an overall guidance approach, which combines confidence guidance in the very early stages of denoising to provide structural hints for the images.\\nThe combination of certainty and overall guidance is defined as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\nx0t,g=\\\\displaystyle x_{0}^{t,g}=\\n\\u2133c\\u2299x0r+\\\\displaystyle\\\\mathcal{M}^{c}\\\\odot x_{0}^{r}+\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(1\\u2212\\u2133c)\\u2299(\\u03b2\\u200b\\u2133\\u03b1\\u200bx0r+(1\\u2212\\u03b2\\u200b\\u2133\\u03b1)\\u200bx0t)\\\\displaystyle(1-\\\\mathcal{M}^{c})\\\\odot(\\\\beta\\\\mathcal{M}^{\\\\alpha}x_{0}^{r}+(1-\\\\beta\\\\mathcal{M}^{\\\\alpha})x_{0}^{t})\\n\\n(12)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u03b2\\\\beta is a hyperparameter that controls the strength of the overall guidance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLLFF [19]\\n\\n\\nMip-NeRF 360 [1]\\n\\n\\nWaymo \\u2009 [29]\\n\\nDM Type\\nw/o Finetune\\nOnly RGBs\\n3D Render\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPSNR\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nSSIM\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nLPIPS\\u2193\\\\downarrow\\n\\n\\nPSNR\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nSSIM\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nLPIPS\\u2193\\\\downarrow\\n\\n\\nKID\\u2193\\\\downarrow\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3DGS [9]\\n\\n18.10\\n0.633\\n0.265\\n21.83\\n0.643\\n0.239\\n0.155\\nN/A\\nN/A\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\nFreeFix + SDXL\\n19.93\\n0.695\\n0.237\\n22.68\\n0.685\\n0.213\\n0.150\\nImage\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\nFreeFix + Flux\\n20.12\\n0.700\\n0.221\\n23.02\\n0.689\\n0.208\\n0.147\\nImage\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\n\\nViewExtrapolator [16]\\n\\n18.27\\n0.614\\n0.338\\n20.84\\n0.591\\n0.332\\n0.180\\nVideo\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\n\\nNVS-Solver [45]\\n\\n11.99\\n0.351\\n0.560\\n12.45\\n0.266\\n0.631\\n0.289\\nVideo\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2718\\n\\n\\n\\nDifix3D+ [37]\\n\\n18.86\\n0.658\\n0.239\\n22.43\\n0.661\\n0.210\\n0.143\\nImage\\n\\u2718\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\n\\nStreetCrafter [41]\\n\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\n0.157\\nVideo\\n\\u2718\\n\\u2718\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 1: Quantitative Comparison with Baselines.

We select LLFF [19] as the evaluation dataset for forward-facing scenes, Mip-NeRF 360 [1] for object-centric scenes, and Waymo [29] for driving scenes.\\nFor the LLFF and MipNeRF datasets, which contain relatively dense captured images, we select sparse or partially observed views as the training set and choose an extrapolated view trajectory that is distant from the views in the training set. The Waymo dataset only provides captured images from a single pass down the street, making it relatively sparse. We only utilize the front cameras as the training set and then translate or rotate the training cameras to create the test views. Details on the design of the training and testing views are provided in the supplementary materials.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWaymo / 143481\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWaymo / 177619\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3DGS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nViewExtrapolator [45]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStreetCrafter [41]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDifix3D+ [37]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFreeFix\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 7: Qualitative Comparisons on Waymo [29]. FreeFix provide superior performance compared to ViewExtrapolator and StreetCrafter, and is comparable to Difix3D+ in the Waymo dataset. In some cases, FreeFix refines the scene even better than Difix3D+.\\n\\n\\n\\nModel Settings and Baselines: \\nFreeFix utilizes two powerful IDMs as its backbone: SDXL [22] and Flux [13], to showcase the capabilities of our method.\\nFor baseline selection, we consider various methods with different settings. For fine-tuning-free methods, we select ViewExtrapolator [16], and NVS-Solver [45] as the baseline. While ViewExtrapolator refines 3DGS with generated views like ours, NVS-Solver employs VDMs as the final renderer, without using 3D renderers, which consumes more computational resources during rendering.\\nFor methods that require fine-tuning of DMs, we choose Difix3D+ [37] and StreetCrafter [41] as baselines. StreetCrafter focuses on urban scenes and requires both LiDAR and RGB observations as input, while Difix3D+ is more generalizable and only requires RGB images. For all methods with a 3D renderer, we apply nearly the same 3D refining steps, ensuring that there are sufficient refining steps for the models to converge.\\n\\n\\nEvaluation Metrics: \\nFor the experiments on LLFF and MipNeRF, we adopt the most common settings for quantitative assessments, which include the evaluation of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS [51]. In the case of the Waymo dataset, where no ground truth is available for the test images, we utilize KID [2] for quantitative assessments.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.1 Comparison with Baselines\\n\\nWe evaluate FreeFix using SDXL [22] and Flux [13] as the diffusion backbone on the LLFF, Mip-NeRF 360, and Waymo datasets. This includes a quantitative comparison in Tab.\\u00a01 and qualitative comparisons in Fig.\\u00a05 and Fig.\\u00a07 against baseline methods. Although FreeFix utilizes only IDMs as the backbone and does not require fine-tuning of the DMs, it still demonstrates performance that is comparable to, or even surpasses, methods that use VDMs or require fine-tuning, both in quantitative and qualitative assessments.\\n\\n\\nSpecifically, ViewExtrapolator [16], which uses opacity masks as guidance, shows slight improvements in LLFF, although the improvement is less significant compared to our confidence-guided solution.\\nMoreover, it fails to provide improvements in Mip-NeRF 360 and Waymo.\\nThis is due to the fact that ViewExtrapolator uses the nearest view from a set of training views as the reference view to generate the test views in a video diffusion model.\\nWhile using the nearest training view as the reference view in SVD performs well in the forward-facing scenes in LLFF, where the test views are closer to the training views, this is usually not the case for Mip-NeRF 360 and Waymo, hence ViewExtrapolator yields degraded performance.\\n\\n\\nDifix3D+ demonstrates the most generalizability and powerful performance across our baselines. FreeFix surpasses Difix3D+ [37] in LLFF and Mip-NeRF 360, while providing comparable performance in Waymo.\\nWe attribute this to the generalizability of DMs. Although Difix3D+ is finetuned on DLV3D [15] and may have encountered similar scenes to those in LLFF and Mip-NeRF 360, the domain gap between datasets still weakens the generalizability of Difix3D+. In contrast, our method maintains the original generalizability of DMs learned from web-scale datasets. Regarding the Waymo dataset, Difix3D+ is fine-tuned on a large-scale in-house driving dataset, where driving scenes are highly structured and exhibit relatively small inter-class differences, making them easier for models to learn.\\n\\n\\nStreetCrafter [41] is tailored for urban scenes and requires LiDAR as input; for this reason, we only conduct experiments with this model on the Waymo dataset. In contrast to the original setting in StreetCrafter, our setup only provides the front camera to color the LiDAR points, which highlights the limitations of StreetCrafter in this context.\\nNVS-Solver produces less satisfying results compared to other methods, which may be attributed to inaccurate depth estimation and warping results. We provide NVS-Solver results in supplementary materials.\\n\\n\\nPlease note that we compute the average score across scenes for each dataset. We provide a quantitative comparison for each scene, along with additional qualitative comparisons in the supplementary materials.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.2 Ablation Study\\n\\nImage Diffusion Models vs Video Diffusion Models: \\nFreeFix can also be applied to VDMs without temporal down-sampling, such as SVD [3]. Although SVD offers inherent consistency across frames, it suffers from blurriness compared to more advanced IDMs. We conduct an ablation study on the scene from MipNeRF-360/Garden to provide quantitative and qualitative comparisons in Tab.\\u00a02 and Fig.\\u00a06. Additionally, we include the results from ViewExtrapolator [16] on the same scene.

We conduct an ablation study of these modules on the scene from MipNeRF-360/Garden, as shown in Tab.\\u00a03. We perform experiments starting from a raw Flux model, which we slightly modify to function as an image-to-image model. We progressively add components from FreeFix to demonstrate the necessity of these techniques.\\n\\n\\n\", \"5 Conclusion\": \"\\n\\n5 Conclusion\\n\\nIn this paper, we present FreeFix, a method for fixing artifacts and improving the quality of 3DGS without fine-tuning DMs. FreeFix demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across various datasets and possesses strong capabilities for deployment with future, more advanced DMs.\\nHowever, FreeFix still has certain limitations. It may encounter failure cases when extrapolated views lead to excessive artifacts with minimal credible guidance. Additionally, the updating process for 3DGS is relatively slow and challenging to converge over dozens of refining steps. These challenges suggest opportunities for future work on designing more robust and efficient methods for integrating 3D reconstruction with 2D generative models.\\n\\n\\nAcknowledgements:\\nThis work is supported by NSFC under grant 62202418, U21B2004, and 62441223, the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2021ZD0114501, and Scientific Research Fund of Zhejiang University grant XY2025028.\\n\\n\\n\", \"6 3DGS Fisher Information Derivation\": \"\\n\\n6 3DGS Fisher Information Derivation\\n\\nThe uncertainty attribute of 3DGS in this paper is defined as:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9e\\u00af\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2=\\u2212log\\u2061pf\\u200b(\\u03c0|\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)\\\\mathcal{\\\\bar{C}}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}=-\\\\log p_{f}(\\\\pi|\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})\\n\\n(13)\\n\\n\\nUnder the following regularity conditions, \\u2212log\\u2061pf\\u200b(\\u03c0|\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)-\\\\log p_{f}(\\\\pi|\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}) can be viewed as a loss term for Fisher information.

The process for generating testing views in the Waymo dataset is straightforward; we translate the camera by 2 to 3 meters or rotate it by 10 to 15 degrees horizontally. However, the design for LLFF and Mip-NeRF 360 is not as straightforward, as we aim to construct extrapolated views that have ground truth images. For this reason, we cannot generate trajectories freely; instead, we need to create partitions for the testing and training sets. We present visualizations of the training and testing cameras in Fig.\\u00a08 from these scenes to illustrate the design of the extrapolated views. For some scenes where obvious extrapolated trajectories cannot be directly extracted, we aim to make the training views sparse in order to produce relative extrapolated trajectories.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLLFF\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfern\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhorns\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nleaves\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfortress\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntrex\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMip-NeRF 360\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngarden\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstump\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbicycle\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncounter\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nkitchen\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 8: Design of Training and Testing Views Design.

In the subsequent third of the 3D refinement steps, every five steps are defined as current-refine steps, and in the final third of the 3D refinement steps, every eight steps are designated as current-refine steps.

As shown in Fig.\\u00a010 and Tab.\\u00a07, the images generated using uncertainty masks as guidance exhibit significant inconsistency, resulting in less satisfying performance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPSNR\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nSSIM\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nLPIPS\\u2193\\\\downarrow\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUncertainty Mask\\n19.30\\n0.515\\n0.310\\n\\n\\nCertainty Mask\\n19.72\\n0.520\\n0.287\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 7: Quantitative Comparison between Uncertainty and Certainty as Guidance. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n9.3 Ablation on Affine Transform\\n\\nWe apply an affine transform during 3D refinement to prevent 3DGS from learning slightly different color styles generated by diffusion models. In this subsection, we present an ablation study for this component on Garden in Mip-NeRF 360. As shown in Tab.\\u00a08, although removing the affine transform slightly improves PSNR, it results in a decrease in SSIM and LPIPS. Furthermore, as illustrated in Fig.\\u00a012, removing the affine transform results in large floaters in testing views, which can significantly lower human sensory preference.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNVS-Solver [45]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFreeFix\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 11: Comparisons on FreeFix and NVS-Solver.

We propose a novel method for sim-to-real transfer of reinforcement learning policies, based on a reinterpretation of neural style transfer from image processing to synthesise novel training data from unpaired unlabelled real world datasets. We employ a variational autoencoder to jointly learn self-supervised feature representations for style transfer and generate weakly paired source-target trajectories to improve physical realism of synthesised trajectories. We demonstrate the application of our approach based on the case study of robot cutting of unknown materials. Compared to baseline methods, including our previous work, CycleGAN, and conditional variational autoencoder-based time series translation, our approach achieves improved task completion time and behavioural stability with minimal real-world data. Our framework demonstrates robustness to geometric and material variation, and highlights the feasibility of policy adaptation in challenging contact-rich tasks where real-world reward information is unavailable.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20846v1\", \"timestamp\": 1769625955, \"sections\": {\"Introduction\": \"\\nIntroduction\\n\\nEmerging applications for robotics have fostered increasing interest in low-volume, high-mix disassembly processes in industry. These processes are characterised by a high degree of uncertainty coupled with demands of logistical flexibility, which traditionally implies the requirement for expensive reprogramming and reconfiguration of robots. This is of interest in domains such as nuclear decommissioning, robotic disassembly of complex products for recycling and re-use, and even areas such as robotic surgery or demolition with robotised demolition equipment. Nonetheless, challenges exist in automated planning and task execution for destructive operations. Whereas manufacturing paradigms centre around achieving high dimensional tolerances and precise control on a known workpiece, for disassembly, the precise location of cutting is less important (few mm as opposed to \\u03bc\\\\mum) while the precise sequence of cutting operations may not be known in advance. This uncertainty has motivated various approaches to robotic cutting, consisting of goal-conditioned trial-and-error & revision [25, 26], 3D reconstruction & planning [9], and online learning & adaptation [18, 22].\\n\\n\\nReinforcement learning (RL) has been applied with success to a variety of contact-rich tasks [2, 23], including robotic cutting [31, 15], particularly with difficult-to-model environments with complex robot-environment interactions, but are nonetheless data intensive. Whereas simulation environments offer reduced complexity and overhead of data collection, differences between simulated and physical cutting processes limit the applicability of adaptive methods to real-world tasks. Examples of such differences include motor backlash, tool wear, chattering, cross-domain mismatch of process and model parameters and other disturbances. These differences motivate the use of domain adaptation methods to align representations or behaviours across domains with minimal real-world supervision. These can be broadly separated into unified feature representation learning, model-based correction, and model-free synthesis of target domain examples.\\n\\n\\nDomain adaptive methods include [29] in which policies are trained on a cross-domain latent feature representation by aligning source and target domain distributions. A related concept applied to milling was proposed in [31] based on a cross-domain meta-model, trained on pairwise unified feature representations. Similarly, adversarial losses using domain discriminators have been employed for cross-domain tool wear classification [20]. Reconstruction-based methods have also been employed to jointly model observation and class distributions[12]; this concept has been further developed based on conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs) [33] wherein CVAE feature representations were used to train an RL policy, while feature representations are aligned across domains.\\n\\n\\nModel-based approaches have previously also been employed for domain adaptation, wherein a source domain task model is augmented with a corrective model based on physics-informed approaches [24], neural networks [13, 5] or Gaussian process (GP) models [19, 27] learned from target domain data. In our previous work, [16] we proposed an imitation learning framework in which a GP corrective model was learned from multiple cutting demonstrations. Nonetheless, model-based approaches incur limitations of modelling assumptions under which the models are introduced, and incur a dataset overhead, particularly for deep predictive modelling approaches.\\n\\n\\nRelating to the aforementioned approaches is direct alignment of observations across domains via translation or generative models. In the context of milling, [4] proposed a domain adaptation method for condition monitoring of different milling tools based on a generative CNN. Similarly, [30], proposed a domain adaptive imitation learning framework from visual demonstrations based on CycleGAN [32]. Generation at object level has also been proposed [17] wherein a StyleGAN image translation model is trained object-wise on weakly-paired cross-domain datasets for 6D pose estimation. CVAEs have also been employed for domain adaptation via synthesis of novel target domain examples [28].\\n\\n\\nNeural style transfer has been extensively researched in the context of image processing [11, 10]. Recently, this concept has been extended to motion execution. Thus far, its application has been limited largely to expressive stylised motions mirroring that of human operators [8, 7]. Nonetheless, its applicability to synthesise novel trajectories with characteristics of diverse human operators presents a compelling case for its application to other domain adaptation problems. Recently, this has been applied for dataset augmentation tasks [6]. A limitation of the aforementioned methods is lack of a suitable pairing mechanism for style and content, as well as lack of feature extractor backbones prevalent in image processing tasks. For transfer learning, addressed this problem [3] by building on the concept of conditional adversarial domain adaptation [21] to achieve feature-level style transfer for transfer learning. Nonetheless, adversarial alignment can be difficult to train, with well-known problems of mode collapse and vanishing gradients. Whereas these developments have been applied to time series classification problems, application of style transfer for RL policy transfer is, to the best of our knowledge, largely unexplored.\\n\\n\\nThis paper extends our previous example-based approach for sim-to-real adaptation to arbitrary real world examples. As with our previous work, our approach does not require re-training of classifiers or encoder networks to adapt to new scenarios (different disturbance forces, differing sensor dynamics, etc.). In contrast to prior work that applies neural style transfer primarily for stylised motion synthesis or dataset augmentation, we apply it as a trajectory-level domain adaptation mechanism for robotic skill transfer. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a latent-space pairing mechanism for content and style that operates without paired examples or retraining; (2) a novel transfer framework based on neural style transfer that does not require labelled or reward-supervised data from the target domain; and (3) empirical evaluation on robotic cutting, a task where conventional reinforcement learning pipelines are difficult to apply due to the absence of reward signal in the real-world deployment environment. An overview of our framework is provided in Figure 1.\\n\\n\\nFigure 1: Overview of proposed framework. In the first stage, a simulation of cutting mechanics is used to generate an expert policy and a variational autoencoder (VAE) is trained on simulated trajectory windows. In the second stage, the VAE encoded representations are used to generate pairings between a simulated and real world dataset which are used as style targets. Finally, expert trajectories are used to train a learner target domain policy with the generated observation windows.\\n\\n\", \"Style transfer framework\": \"\\nStyle transfer framework\\n\\nVariational autoencoder\\n\\nThe variational autoencoder (VAE) consists of two neural networks: an encoder q\\u03d5\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc9b|\\ud835\\udc99)q_{\\\\phi}(\\\\boldsymbol{z}|\\\\boldsymbol{x}) that approximates the posterior over latent variables \\ud835\\udc9b\\u2208\\u211dL\\\\boldsymbol{z}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{L}, and a decoder p\\u03b8\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc99|\\ud835\\udc9b)p_{\\\\theta}(\\\\boldsymbol{x}|\\\\boldsymbol{z}) that reconstructs the data from the latent representation.

Training was carried out with the Adam optimiser, with model hyperparameters established via manual search, reported in Table Style transfer. Both encoder and decoder networks were implemented as strided convolutional networks with 3 layers. Batch normalisation was further employed to accelerate convergence and reduce training instability. The encoder architecture is visualised in Figure 2.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: Overview of VAE encoder architecture; layer indices for style transfer are demarcated.\\n\\n\\nThe VAE training dataset consisted of a mixture of 680 on-policy and off-policy simulated trajectories. We consider a trajectory as a multivariate time series of length TT which comprises a sequence of state-action pairs:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u03c4={(\\ud835\\udc99t,\\ud835\\udc9at)}t=1T\\\\tau=\\\\{(\\\\boldsymbol{x}_{t},\\\\boldsymbol{y}_{t})\\\\}_{t=1}^{T}\\n\\n(4)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udc99t\\u2208\\u211dNS\\\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{N_{S}}, \\ud835\\udc9at\\u2208\\u211dNA\\\\boldsymbol{y}_{t}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{N_{A}} are the states, actions at time tt respectively. Each trajectory \\u03c4\\\\tau is divided into overlapping windows of length NN, resulting in a set of state and action windows:\\n\\n\\n\\nx(i)=\\\\displaystyle x^{(i)}=\\n[xt,xt+1,\\u2026,xt+N]\\u2208\\u211dN\\u00d7NS\\\\displaystyle[x_{t},x_{t+1},\\\\dots,x_{t+N}]\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\times N_{S}}\\n\\n(5)\\n\\n\\n\\ny(i)=\\\\displaystyle y^{(i)}=\\n[yt,yt+1,\\u2026,yt+N]\\u2208\\u211dN\\u00d7NA\\\\displaystyle[y_{t},y_{t+1},\\\\dots,y_{t+N}]\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\times N_{A}}\\n\\n(6)\\n\\n\\nThe window width NN and latent code dimensionality emerge as tunable parameters for which a trade-off exists between the temporal context afforded to the model, reproduction accuracy and saliency of the latent space. Through preliminary experiments, this was reflected in increased RMS error of the autoencoder reconstructions and reduced average cosine similarity between simulated and real world embeddings with increasing NN and dimensionality respectively. A window size of N=100N=100 samples (2 seconds) was identified as providing the best trade-off between these factors.\\n\\n\\n\\nPolicy adaptation\\n\\nWe adopt a similar approach to our previous work [16] to adapt a pre-trained policy to observations synthesised from unlabelled target domain data. In this procedure, an \\u201cexpert\\u201d policy \\u03c0e\\\\pi_{e} is initially trained in a simulation environment with a physically-informed cutting model, as introduced in our previous work [14], with model parameters from Table Style transfer. The expert was trained initially for 32000 episodes using the proximal policy optimisation (PPO) algorithm with domain randomisation of material properties. A translation function f:\\u211dN\\u00d7NS\\u2192\\u211dN\\u00d7NAf:\\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\times N_{S}}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\times N_{A}} is applied to each state window:\\n\\n\\n\\nx(g,i)\\u2063\\u2217=f\\u200b(x(c,i))x^{(g,i)*}=f(x^{(c,i)})\\n\\n(7)\\n\\n\\nand translated states paired with the corresponding expert action on x(c)x^{(c)} to generate a labelled dataset\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9f={(x(g,i),\\u03c0e\\u200b(x(c,i)))}.\\\\mathcal{D}=\\\\{(x^{(g,i)},\\\\pi_{e}(x^{(c,i)}))\\\\}.\\n\\n(8)\\n\\n\\nWe subsequently train a target domain policy \\u03c0g\\\\pi_{g}, initialised as \\u03c0g=\\u03c0e\\\\pi_{g}=\\\\pi_{e} on \\ud835\\udc9f\\\\mathcal{D} using behavioural cloning. We note this procedure can be extended to alternative imitation learning algorithms (such as DAgger) provided ff can be inferred during generation of source windows x(c,i)x^{(c,i)}. Under the assumption that the environment satisfies the Markov property, the policy learning process is unaffected by the windowing procedure. As the full trajectories do not need to be reconstructed, limitations of other methods such as requirement for blending or enforcing temporal consistency are inapplicable to this work [7]. Furthermore, as each trajectory is decomposed into T\\u2212N+1T-N+1 windows, the windowing approach has the effect of significantly augmenting the training data.\\n\\n\\n\\nStyle transfer\\n\\nIn this work, we consider neural style transfer[11] as a translation function wherein x(g)\\u2063\\u2217x^{(g)*} arise from solving the style transfer optimisation problem:\\n\\n\\n\\nx(g,i)\\u2063\\u2217=arg\\u2061minx(g,i)\\u2061(wc\\u200bLc\\u200b(x,x(c,i))+ws\\u200bLs\\u200b(x,x(s,j)))x^{(g,i)*}=\\\\arg\\\\min_{x^{(g,i)}}\\\\left(w_{c}L_{c}(x,x^{(c,i)})+w_{s}L_{s}(x,x^{(s,j)})\\\\right)\\n\\n(9)\\n\\n\\nwhere wcw_{c} and wsw_{s} are the content and style weights, respectively and LcL_{c}, LsL_{s} are content and style loss contributions respectively. The content loss is defined as:\\n\\n\\n\\nLc=\\u2211l\\u2211i,j12\\u200bNl\\u200b(Fi\\u200bj(c,l)\\u2212Fi\\u200bj(g,l))2L_{c}=\\\\sum_{l}\\\\sum_{i,j}\\\\frac{1}{2N_{l}}\\\\left(F^{(c,l)}_{ij}-F^{(g,l)}_{ij}\\\\right)^{2}\\n\\n(10)\\n\\n\\nwhere F(c,l)F^{(c,l)}, F(g,l)F^{(g,l)} are the feature outputs of layer ll for the content and generated output respectively. The style loss similarly is expressed as\\n\\n\\n\\nLs=\\u2211l\\u2211i,j14\\u200bNl2\\u200bMl2\\u200b(Gi\\u200bj(s,l)\\u2212Gi\\u200bj(g,l))2L_{s}=\\\\sum_{l}\\\\sum_{i,j}\\\\frac{1}{4N^{2}_{l}M^{2}_{l}}\\\\left(G^{(s,l)}_{ij}-G^{(g,l)}_{ij}\\\\right)^{2}\\n\\n(11)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udc06(s,l)\\\\mathbf{G}^{(s,l)} is the style Gram matrix of layer ll outputs F(s,l)F^{(s,l)}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc06(s,l)=F(s,l)\\u200bF\\ud835\\uddb3\\u200b(s,l)\\\\mathbf{G}^{(s,l)}=F^{(s,l)}F^{\\\\mathsf{T}(s,l)}\\n\\n(12)\\n\\n\\nand similarly for \\ud835\\udc06(c,l)\\\\mathbf{G}^{(c,l)}. The generated windows were initialised as\\n\\n\\n\\nx(g,i)=x(c,i)x^{(g,i)}=x^{(c,i)}\\n\\n(13)\\n\\n\\nand (9) optimised by gradient descent using the Adam optimiser. The relative content-style weighting wc/w\\u200bsw_{c}/w{s} was tuned manually through a grid-search procedure. Figure 3 shows the effect of content-style weighting on their relative loss contributions. At low values of wc/w\\u200bsw_{c}/w{s}, the total loss is dominated by increasing content reconstruction error; the generated windows diverge substantially from the original windows with marginal effect on style reconstruction. Hence, wc/w\\u200bsw_{c}/w{s} was reduced until diminishing returns on the (unweighted) style reconstruction loss was observed. We report relevant optimisation parameters in Table Style transfer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 3: Effect of content-style weight ratio wc/wlw_{c}/w_{l} on normalised (unweighted) content-style loss, averaged over 5 content-style batches (batch size 256), with chosen value wc/ws=0.02w_{c}/w_{s}=0.02 indicated (dotted line). Decreasing ratio results in diminishing returns on style while diverging substantially from the original content windows. Increasing ratio tends towards identity (generated windows correspond to unaltered simulated windows).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 1: Selected hyperparameters for encoder network and style transfer framework.\\n\\n\\n\\nParameter\\nValue\\n\\n\\nEncoder learning rate\\n1\\u00d710\\u221231\\\\times 10^{-3}\\n\\n\\nEncoder output channels\\n[128,256,512]\\\\left[128,256,512\\\\right]\\n\\n\\nEncoder kernel size\\n3\\n\\n\\nEncoder batch size\\n128\\n\\n\\nEncoder kernel stride\\n2\\n\\n\\nWindow size\\n100\\n\\n\\nLatent dimensions\\n130\\n\\n\\nContent-style ratio wc/wsw_{c}/w_{s}\\n\\n0.02\\n\\n\\nStyle transfer learning rate\\n0.01\\n\\n\\nStyle transfer iterations\\n1000\\n\\n\\nContent layer indices (Fig. 2)\\n[x]\\n\\n\\nStyle layer indices (Fig. 2)\\n[2, 5, 7]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 4: Convergence plot for style transfer optimisation with parameters from Table Style transfer for a batch of 256 content-style pairings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 2: Table of model parameters for cutting simulation (source domain)\\n\\n\\n\\nParameter\\nValue\\n\\n\\nPitch angle [rad]\\n0.126\\n\\n\\nHelix angle [rad]\\n0.0\\n\\n\\nRadius [m]\\n0.025\\n\\n\\nCutter width [m]\\n0.0005\\n\\n\\nCutting elements (flutes)\\n50\\n\\n\\nSpindle speed [rpm]\\n1000\\n\\n\\nMaterial cutting\\n\\n\\n\\n-mechanistic constant (KcK_{c}) [N/mm2]\\nvariable\\n\\n\\nMaterial edge\\n\\n\\n\\n-mechanistic constant (KeK_{e}) [N/mm]\\nvariable\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 5: t-SNE embedding diagram of content-style pairings. The points are coloured according to their class (simulation, blue / real world, red) with intensity according to the cosine similarity of their closest match, diverging from 0.5. The area of each real world embedding point is directly proportional to the number of times the corresponding window was matched.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA compelling advantage of encoder or classifier-based approaches is that they operate on unpaired cross-domain datasets. To improve the realism of generated trajectories, we employ a pairing mechanism that takes advantage of the unsupervised feature representations learned from the source domain data to generate weakly paired content and style windows. An intuitive analogue would be matching images with similar composition and subjects, reminiscent of the weak paring mechanism in [17]. In the first stage, the real world dataset is encoded in entirety by the encoder network to generate a dataset of embeddings. In the second stage, the simulated content window(s) are encoded and a content-style pairing matrix is constructed by the pairwise cosine similarity between x(c,i)x^{(c,i)}, x(s,j)x^{(s,j)} representations as\\n\\n\\n\\nSi\\u200bj=zi\\u22c5zj\\u2016zi\\u2016\\u22c5\\u2016zj\\u2016S_{ij}=\\\\frac{z_{i}\\\\cdot z_{j}}{||z_{i}||\\\\cdot||z_{j}||}\\n\\n(14)\\n\\n\\nIn the last stage, the closest match real embedding is paired with the simulated embedding. For each row ii, the index of the most similar pairing was obtained by:\\n\\n\\n\\nj\\u2217\\u200bi=arg\\u2061max\\u2061j,Si\\u200bjj^{*}i=\\\\arg\\\\max{j},S_{ij}\\n\\n(15)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor windows where the pairing diverged substantially from the content, the optimisation process introduced mean shifts into the observations, as well as introducing artefacts from the encoding process. Following the intuition of [10], qualitatively, we observed that pre-aligning the means of the content and style windows resulted in higher quality generated outputs. Figure 5 shows a representation of the content-style pairings generated by the pairing procedure. The data show the formation of distinct clusters according to simulated and real world trajectories. Unsurprisingly, the real world embeddings with the most matches were found predominantly at the intersections of the clusters. This parasitic behaviour is reminiscent of the mode-collapse phenomenon in generative-adversarial networks. Nonetheless, around 50% of real world points were matched at least once, with matched windows dispersed throughout the latents, indicating good coverage of the real world dataset.\\n\\n\\nFor adaptation, 50 episodic trajectories were collected in source domain with the expert policy, which formed the content dataset. For this work, the style dataset consisted of 148 off-policy trajectories collected from the real world. We note this is not a hard requirement; dataset size is motivated primarily by avoiding breakdown of the pairing and style transfer mechanism where content and style windows diverge substantially.\\n\\n\\n\\nExperimental setup\\n\\nAs with our previous work, experimental validation was carried out on a KUKA LBR iiwa R820 14kg collaborative robot equipped with a wrist-mounted motorised slitting saw tool. The iiwa was connected via the Fast Research Interface (FRI) to a Robot Operating System (ROS) workstation with a communication frequency of 500Hz. The workstation consisted of an Intel i7-8086K CPU, NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti GPU with 11GB VRAM, and 32GB RAM. The robot was equipped with a motorised slitting saw tool; whereas geometric parameters of the tool reflect the training parameters in Table Style transfer, the number of teeth was doubled to introduce further cross-domain mismatch.\\n\\n\\nThe cutting task was represented as a single conventional milling pass over an material with variable geometry, following a nominal trajectory defined at the material surface. As proof of principle, the reference path was defined manually with respect to the surface for all case studies. During the cutting task, the policy provides as output a translational stiffness, incremental offset to the depth of cut (DoC), and the feed rate, relative to the planned (nominal) trajectory. The nominal feed rate was chosen as 0.75 m/min. The controller damping gain \\ud835\\udc0ad\\\\mathbf{K}_{d} was adjusted independently according to the stiffness to provide a damping ratio of 1.0 (i.e. critically damped).

However, our method in principle is applicable to different types of sensors, such as those built in to the iiwa, provided real world examples collected with such sensors.

To demonstrate the performance of each method on a range of materials, cutting trials were carried out on polyurethane foam, cardboard, corrugated plastic, mica and aluminium. We further establish 3 separate case studies on each material to evaluate the policy performance under different path planning conditions. We evaluate each method by task completion time, average path deviation, average tool load, material removed volume (MRV), and similarity of the adopted action trajectories to the source domain expert actions, averaged over 5 trials per material for each strategy, and aggregated over all materials. To mitigate effects of drift (e.g. tool wear, temperature, calibration errors), trials for each strategy were interleaved.\\n\\n\\nComparison methods\\n\\nFor the subsequent real world experiments, we adopt the following terminology to denote comparison methods: \\u2018Expert\\u2019 refers to the unadapted source simulation expert policy, as transferred directly to the real world task. \\u2018BC\\u2019, or standalone behavioural cloning, represents our previous work, in which the simulation is augmented with a Gaussian process (GP) regression model trained on aligned demonstrations from 14 preliminary experiments on aluminium and mica. \\u2018CVAE\\u2019 represents a conditional variational autoencoder using the same real world dataset as adopted for style transfer. Note in this instance, the encoder itself is trained on the entire dataset of both real world and simulation data, conditioned on a one-hot domain label (simulation or real world). Simulated data are encoded as with the style transfer approach, however, at decoding time, the one-hot class label is swapped to generate a synthetic window of the desired class. \\u2018CycleGAN\\u2019 is also introduced as a comparison method. In this instance, the surrogate real world dataset is synthesised by the sim-to-real generator network. With all methods, the generator / encoder architecture was chosen equivalent to Table Style transfer. For CycleGAN, a smaller discriminator network, with output channels [64,128,256][64,128,256] was used due to mitigate the well-known \\u2018vanishing gradient\\u2019 problem during GAN training. All other hyperparameters were chosen to be equivalent to the CycleGAN study. All methods were employed with behavioural cloning as per the self-supervision procedure introduced in this work. Additionally, as a benchmark, we include a \\u201cbaseline\\u201d strategy in which the process parameters are held constant at the nominal feed rate (0.75m/min) and depth of cut of 1 mm, applied to all materials.\\n\\n\\n\\nPlanar material case study\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) Flat\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) DoC offset\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(c) Curved\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 7: Boxplot summary of performance metrics for the style transfer trained policy and comparison methods, aggregated over all materials. Metrics include task completion time, average path deviation, average load force, average (normalised) dynamic time warping (DTW) distance between each strategy and the simulation expert policy (lower better), and material removed volume (MRV, higher better).\\n\\n\\nEach strategy was initially tested on a planar material, with the reference path calibrated at the material surface. For the calibration procedure, the surface was modelled as a warped plane interpolated between 4 corner points obtained via guarded move with a force threshold of 1N, with the exception of foam, where contact was confirmed visually. The performance of each strategy for the planar case study is outlined in Figure 7(a). To aid interpretation, the significance of the difference in metrics was tested via one-way ANOVA. The normality and homoscedasticity assumptions of ANOVA were tested via the Shapiro-Wilk and Levene methods respectively. A significance level of \\u03b1=0.05\\\\alpha=0.05 was used for all tests. Metrics that did not satisfy the assumptions were transformed via Box-Cox transform:\\n\\n\\n\\ny={x\\u03bb\\u22121if\\u200b\\u03bb\\u22600log\\u2061(x)otherwisey=\\\\begin{cases}x^{\\\\lambda}-1&\\\\mathrm{if}\\\\,\\\\lambda\\\\neq 0\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\log(x)&\\\\mathrm{otherwise}\\\\end{cases}\\n\\n(18)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u03bb\\\\lambda is chosen to maximise the log-likelihood of the transformed data under a normality assumption. In the case of completion time and average force, the assumptions of ANOVA were satisfied (Shapiro p=0.361p=0.361, p=0.355p=0.355; Levene p=0.0689p=0.0689, p=0.0983p=0.0983, respectively). Average path deviation and MRV did not satisfy the normality assumption after transformation, and in this case the Kruskal-Wallis test was adopted without transformation. For both task completion time and average force, one-way ANOVA revealed significant effects of strategy on performance (F=61.1F=61.1, p=1.14\\u00d710\\u221227p=1.14\\\\times 10^{-27}; F=6.74F=6.74, p=6.52\\u00d710\\u22125p=6.52\\\\times 10^{-5} respectively) between strategy and these performance metrics.\\n\\n\\nTo examine the effect of individual strategy on the performance metrics, the Tukey Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) was used for ANOVA, and the Dunn post-hoc test for Kruskal-Wallis. No significant difference in task completion times was found between style transfer and BC, whereas the former outperformed all other methods. Style transfer had the largest effect relative to GAN (\\u22121.00-1.00 s) and the smallest relative to the Expert (\\u22120.329-0.329 s). For path deviation, style transfer significantly differed from the Expert (\\u22121.50-1.50 mm, p=0.000196p=0.000196) and GAN (0.4510.451 mm, p=0.005074p=0.005074) strategies, however, results were inconclusive for BC (p=0.560p=0.560) and CVAE (p=0.109p=0.109). Style transfer was further found to significantly outperform the Expert and BC strategies in minimising average force (\\u22121.273-1.273 N, p=0.0001p=0.0001; \\u22120.651-0.651 N, p=0.0352p=0.0352), however, no significant difference was found between style transfer and the CVAE and GAN strategies (p=0.867p=0.867, p=0.611p=0.611). The choice of strategy was found to have no conclusive effect on MRV (Kruskal H=2.87H=2.87, p=0.578p=0.578). This result appears surprising in light of the differing action selection apparent for each strategy, particularly in DoC.\\n\\n\\nTo examine the effect of the adaptation methods on the agent actions, the actions taken during each trial were compared with 50 simulated experiments (i.e. source domain) carried out with the source domain expert, and the similarity of action trajectories evaluated by normalised dynamic time warping (DTW) distance. The strategies that adopt actions that are more broadly similar to the source domain expert will score lower on this metric than those that deviate substantially from the expert behaviour. The expert policy itself was included in this comparison since it is being applied to the target domain. We report effect sizes as Hedges\\u2019 gg. Clear differences between the strategies were indicated (Kruskal H=1930H=1930, p=0.0p=0.0), with style transfer yielding large improvements relative to the Expert g=0.875g=0.875 and GAN g=2.18g=2.18, a moderate improvement for CVAE g=0.575g=0.575 and a small reduction in performance relative to BC g=\\u22120.370g=-0.370. Post-hoc testing indicated a high significance level in these effects (p\\u22643.65\\u00d710\\u221217p\\\\leq 3.65\\\\times 10^{-17}) for all comparisons.\\n\\n\\nTo examine the behaviour of each strategy in more detail and enable qualitative comparisons between each strategy, the action trajectories adopted by each policy during an example trial on foam and mica are presented in Figure 8. From Figure 8(a), 8(d), 8(g), 8(j), the action trajectories were broadly similar between BC and style transfer across both materials. Style transfer adopts a more correct behaviour of reducing the feed rate prior to engagement with the material, as compared with BC. Conversely, the GAN policy diverges substantially from the expert behaviour which corroborates the DTW metric results. All adapted policies adopted a more consistent DoC throughout both trials than the unadapted expert policy. Differences between the policy behaviour on each material were mainly evident in the DoC behaviour, transverse stiffness (KxK_{x}) and, to a lesser extent, the normal stiffness (KzK_{z}).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFlat\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2005DoC offset\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2002\\u200aCurved\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) Foam - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) Foam - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(c) Foam - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(d) Foam - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(e) Foam - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(f) Foam - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(g) Mica - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(h) Mica - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(i) Mica - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(j) Mica - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(k) Mica - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(l) Mica - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 8: Comparison of agent actions for foam and mica for planar, DoC offset and curved case studies respectively. Actions include the relative to nominal feed rate adjustment, with 0 corresponding to no change and 1 to double the nominal feed rate, depth of cut (DoC), and controller stiffness in transverse, feed direction and normal directions respectively (Kp,xK_{p,x}, Kp,yK_{p,y}, Kp,zK_{p,z}. Units of KpK_{p} are chosen consistent with (16)).\\n\\n\\n\\nRobustness to path planning offset\\n\\nTo examine the robustness of the method to path planning errors - for example, due to errors in calibration, surface position estimation or noise, we further examine the performance of all strategies with a path planning offset of 1mm, inset into the ground truth material surface. The performance of each strategy was evaluated over 3 trials per strategy, per material.\\n\\n\\nSimilarly to the planar case, strategy significantly impacted task completion times (ANOVA F=17.0F=17.0, p=9.94\\u00d710\\u221210p=9.94\\\\times 10^{-10}); style transfer again differed significantly from all strategies except BC (Tukey HSD p=0.0694p=0.0694), and improvements over other strategies being similar to the planar case study, albeit more consistent across strategies (effect size range \\u22120.658-0.658-\\u22120.850-0.850 s). Whereas path deviation was also influenced by strategy (ANOVA F=4.61F=4.61, p=0.00235p=0.00235), post-hoc testing indicated only GAN differed significantly from the BC (p=0.0047p=0.0047) and Expert (p=0.0125p=0.0125) strategies. Although group means were more concentrated than in the planar case, path deviation was notably more consistent across trials for style transfer, CVAE, and GAN, implying these strategies were better able to tolerate the path planning offset and maintain stable path tracking across materials. MRV was again unaffected by strategy (Kruskal-Wallis H=2.61H=2.61, p=0.624p=0.624), and contrasting the planar case study, no significant differences were observed in average tool load (ANOVA F=1.06F=1.06, p=0.382p=0.382). Similarly to the planar case study, there was a clear separation between the strategies in terms of similarity to expert actions (Kruskal H=688H=688, p=9.33\\u00d710\\u2212148p=9.33\\\\times 10^{-148}). Post-hoc testing indicated style transfer was distinct from the comparison methods, with the least significant result being with CVAE (p=0.0314p=0.0314), small negative effects for BC g=\\u22120.321g=-0.321 and CVAE g=\\u22120.151g=-0.151 and positive effects relative to Expert g=0.682g=0.682 and GAN g=1.31g=1.31 strategies.\\n\\n\\nFigure 8(b), 8(e), 8(h), 8(k) shows the agent actions for the offset case study. All strategies exhibited a more sporadic DoC behaviour than the planar case study, with style transfer exhibiting the most consistent DoC behaviour across both materials, and matching more closely to the planar case study behaviour, supporting observations regarding the consistency of the path deviation. All strategies exhibited a more aggressive variation in stiffness relative to the planar case study, indicating a compensatory response to the offset cutting depth.\\n\\n\\n\\nNon-planar surfaces\\n\\nWe further showcase the performance of each strategy when both material and surface geometry are altered to varying degrees of curvature. Consistent with the planar case study, the reference path with respect to the surface was assumed already known; however, we note that numerous path-planning methods have been proposed in the context of milling, including the case where surface geometry is unknown [9]. For this case study, we assume the material is a thin plate under pure bending, with the surface modelled as a section of a truncated oblique cone \\u2013 in other words, an interpolation between two circular arcs. The arc parameters for each endpoint were derived from a 3-point estimation obtained similarly to the planar case study. Curvatures ranged between 2.36 m-1 and 4.04 m-1 across materials. Cardboard was excluded from the set of materials since the maximum curvature generated during preliminary experiments did not meaningfully differ from the previous case studies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) Polyurethane foam\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) Corrugated plastic\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(c) Mica\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(d) Aluminium\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 9: 3D plot of TCP paths adopted by each strategy with respect to the material surface - qualitative defects are shown in the \\u201cexpert\\u201d and \\u201cGAN\\u201d strategies, which exhibit transverse path deviations on the stiffer materials.\\n\\n\\nAs with the prior case studies, strategy had a significant effect on completion time (Kruskal H=38.5H=38.5, p=8.44\\u00d710\\u22128p=8.44\\\\times 10^{-8}) and in post-hoc testing, style transfer outperformed all strategies except BC (p=0.529p=0.529). The effect of style transfer largely reflected the planar case study, with \\u22121.00-1.00 s relative to GAN, and \\u22120.413-0.413 s relative to the Expert. Differences in path deviation were inconclusive compared to the planar case study, (Kruskal H=9.77H=9.77, p=0.0445p=0.0445) with the most significant result from post-hoc testing arising between GAN and style transfer (p=0.0589p=0.0589); however, differences in average force were more pronounced (ANOVA F=7.71F=7.71, p=0.000025p=0.000025), with style transfer significantly outperforming GAN (\\u22121.25-1.25 N, p=0.0001p=0.0001) but not the other strategies. Corroborating the previous case studies, MRV did not significantly differ between strategies (Kruskal H=2.15H=2.15, p=0.708p=0.708). Furthermore, action similarity again revealed clear separation between strategies (Kruskal H=1390H=1390, p=2.64\\u00d710\\u2212300p=2.64\\\\times 10^{-300}), with style transfer exhibiting the largest deviation from GAN (g=2.14g=2.14) and significant differences from all others (BC g=\\u22120.264g=-0.264, CVAE g=0.503g=0.503, Expert g=0.487g=0.487).\\n\\n\\nThe agent actions, as shown in Figure 8(c), 8(f), 8(i), 8(l), show similar behaviours to the offset case study, with differences in DoC behaviour becoming more pronounced, particularly for the expert policy. CycleGAN adopted a highly sporadic action profile in feed rate and stiffness, particularly for the foam trials. A hypothesis for this behaviour is that the curved material presents a more challenging case for the agent and the much lower cutting forces limit information available to the agent to make decisions. Therefore, the actions resemble those at the beginning of the planar trials in which the agent is in free space and has no information about the contact state or tool engagement. Style transfer and BC both exhibited less consistent DoC behaviour than the planar case studies on foam, however, produced smoother action trajectories that were strongly correlated to the engagement state - for example, contact initiation was well-demarcated for both strategies.\\n\\n\\nFigure 9 shows a representative example of the 3D TCP positions adopted by each strategy for a single cutting trial. The TCP trajectories adopted exhibited clear defects for the expert and GAN trials, which were evident across both low and high stiffness materials. On the low stiffness materials, such as in Figure 9(a) these were evident as low-frequency irregularities, resembling a random walk, whereas for the high stiffness materials, this was exhibited as a higher frequency \\u201cwobble\\u201d, which were unrelated to known phenomena such as chattering. These defects were suppressed or entirely absent during the BC, CVAE and style transfer trials, with these methods yielding similar qualitative improvements across all materials.\\n\\n\\n\", \"Discussion\": \"\\nDiscussion\\n\\nFor the cutting task, the proposed method was evaluated based on task completion times, average path deviation, tool load (average force), material removed volume, behavioural similarity to expert action trajectories in source domain, and qualitatively by the action trajectories, ability to maintain consistent cutting conditions (e.g. depth of cut), as well as TCP trajectories. Relative to the comparison methods \\u2013 consisting of the unadapted source domain expert policy (Expert), our previous work (BC), conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) and CycleGAN (generative adversarial network) \\u2013 the proposed method based on style transfer consistently achieved significant reductions in task completion time across all case studies. Compared to BC and CVAE, style transfer showed comparative performance but did not uniformly surpass them across all metrics.\\n\\n\\nThe reduced influence of strategy in the offset path case study is consistent with the constraint imposed by insetting the path into the material, which limits the ability of the agent to regulate the true DoC. It also implies a common limitation of these methods in modelling out-of-distribution task conditions, wherein offsetting the reference path and nominal feed rate introduces concept shift in the optimal actions across domains in addition to covariate shift in the observations. Although path deviation was more consistent across style transfer, CVAE and GAN strategies than for BC and the expert policy, overall improvements were primarily inconclusive. It is plausible that the inconclusive effects may be attributable to the reduced number of samples for the offset case study.\\n\\n\\nQualitatively, the style transfer trained policy demonstrated improved behavioural stability relative to the model-free approaches, with smoother action trajectories and more consistent control of depth-of-cut and stiffness, which was robust to perturbations in surface geometry and cutting path, and corroborated by higher action similarity to the source domain expert relative to all strategies except BC. The irregular path deviations observed in the TCP trajectories were attributable to the largely sporadic action trajectories of the expert policy, and, to a lesser extent, the GAN strategy. For the stiffer materials, deviations in the path are caused by contact instabilities resulting from interaction between the policy stiffness and the environment stiffness. These behaviours were largely absent with the BC, CVAE and style transfer strategies.\\n\\n\\nWe hypothesise that the poorer performance of CycleGAN-based domain adaptation arises from its limited capacity to preserve task-relevant structure in the translated observations, which has been documented in related work [1]. While CycleGAN has been effective in visual domains where semantic content remains invariant under style changes\\u2014e.g. image-to-image translation, its application to time-series control tasks may disrupt temporal dependencies or distort dynamics-critical features, leading to degraded policy performance.\\n\\n\", \"Conclusion\": \"\\nConclusion\\n\\nAn example-based approach for sim-to-real transfer in robotic control was proposed based on the principle of neural style transfer. Empirical results on a robotic cutting task demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable or superior performance to our previous work, conditional variational autoencoders, and CycleGAN-based time series translation across diverse materials and geometric scenarios, while substantially relaxing the assumptions of our previous example-based work. The proposed method is sample-efficient, demonstrated with 148 off-policy real world trajectories versus 32000 for initial policy training, and avoids the need for training domain discriminator, generator or corrective models, a crucial limitation of previously proposed adaptation methods.\\n\\n\\nWe note the limitation that this work does not explicitly address differing cross-domain target (action) distributions or compatibility of generated trajectories with robot kinematic and dynamic constraints. We posit such constraints could be formulated as part of the optimisation process wherein physical feasibility losses are jointly optimised with style and content losses, and represents a possible extension of this work. Additionally, the quality of generated trajectories and pairings is expected to deteriorate with low coverage of real-world examples, weak content-style match similarity, or parasitic matching where a small subset of real trajectories dominate the pairing.\\n\\n\", \"Data availability\": \"\\nData availability\\n\\nThe datasets generated during and/or analysed during the current study are available in the Figshare repository, DOI 10.6084/m9.figshare.28983659.\\n\\n\", \"Funding Declaration\": \"\\nFunding Declaration\\n\\nThis work was supported by the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) project \\u201cResearch and Development of a Highly Automated and Safe Streamlined Process for Increase Lithium-ion Battery Repurposing and Recycling\\u201d (REBELION) under Grant 101104241.\\n\\n\", \"Acknowledgements\": \"\\nAcknowledgements\\n\\nThe authors would further like to acknowledge Abdelaziz Wasfy Shaarawy, Carl Meggs and Christopher Gell respectively for assistance with experimental validation, design of material holder and cutter tool for experiments herein.\\n\\n\", \"Author contributions\": \"\\nAuthor contributions\\n\\nConceptualisation - A.R. and J.H.; data curation - J.H.; formal analysis - J.H.; funding acquisition - A.R. and R.S.; investigation - J.H.; methodology - J.H. and A.R.; project administration - A.R. and R.S.; software - J.H.; resources - J.H., A.R. and R.S.; supervision - A.R. and R.S.; validation - J.H. and A.R.; visualisation - J.H.; writing (original draft) - J.H.; writing (review & editing) - J.H. and A.R. and R.S.\\n\\n\", \"Competing interests\": \"\\nCompeting interests\\n\\nThe authors declare no competing interests.\\n\\n\"}, \"bibliography\": {\"[1]\": \"\\n[1]\\nH.

naturally reason about object functionality, identify the relevant functional element (e.g., a heater knob or thermostat), and interact with it using an appropriate body configuration.\\nHowever, performing such functionally-correct interactions in a novel 3D environment remains challenging for embodied intelligent agents, as it requires a holistic understanding of scene semantics and the human actions that the environment affords\\u00a0[7, 4].\\nIn this work, we investigate to generate realistic and functional interactions between a 3D human body and a novel scene, conditioned on open-vocabulary task descriptions.\\nAn effective solution to this problem benefits a wide range of applications, including embodied AI, robotics, game production, and video generation, among many others.\\n\\n\\nThe synthesis of 3D human-scene interaction (HSI) has been extensively studied, with existing methods broadly falling into two paradigms.\\nData-driven approaches learn generative models from paired 3D interaction data, achieving high visual fidelity and realistic human poses in controlled settings.\\nFor example, COINS\\u00a0[47] models human body poses conditioned on scene geometry and text commands, while TriDi\\u00a0[29] learns a joint distribution over human pose, object geometry, and interaction signals using diffusion models.\\nDespite their effectiveness, such methods rely on large-scale, high-quality paired interaction datasets and typically require explicit interaction specifications (e.g., \\u201csitting on a sofa\\u201d), limiting their ability to generalize to diverse novel scenes.\\nTo alleviate data dependency, recent work has explored zero-shot or training-free pipelines that leverage pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to generate human-scene interactions.\\nRepresentative examples include GenZI\\u00a0[18], which reconstructs 3D human bodies from multi-view image synthesis, and GenHSI\\u00a0[20], which integrates image-based object grounding with 3D body fitting from a single input image.\\nWhile these methods improve flexibility and support open-vocabulary task prompts, they are primarily effective for general human-scene interactions describing physical relations or motions, e.g., \\u201csitting on a sofa\\u201d or \\u201cwalking on a bridge\\u201d.\\n\\n\\nIn contrast, many real-world tasks like \\u201copen the window\\u201d involve interactions at a functional level, where a human must identify and interact with fine-grained functional elements in the 3D scene to complete the task, such as finding and contacting a window handle to open a window, as shown in Fig.\\u00a01.\\nWe refer to this setting as functional human-scene interaction.\\nThis problem poses fundamental challenges, as it requires reasoning about both the semantics of functional elements in 3D scenes and the 3D human poses needed to establish appropriate contacts.\\nExisting methods typically lack explicit reasoning about object functionality and the corresponding human-scene contact, leading to interactions that are either geometrically implausible or functionally incorrect.\\n\\n\\nIn this work, we propose FunHSI, a training-free, functionality-driven\\nframework that enables functional human-scene interactions from\\nopen-vocabulary task prompts.\\nGiven a set of posed RGB-D images and a task prompt, FunHSI reasons about the functionality of the 3D scene and synthesizes a 3D human that interacts with the scene in a functionally correct manner to accomplish the specified task.\\nAs illustrated in Fig.\\u00a02, FunHSI is built upon three key components.\\nFirst, we introduce a functionality-aware contact reasoning module to identify task-relevant functional elements in the scene, reconstruct their 3D geometry, and infer high-level interaction patterns via contact graph reasoning.\\nThe resulting contact graph explicitly encodes the contact relationships between the human body and both functional and supporting scene elements, serving as a structured representation that bridges high-level task intent and low-level physical interaction.\\nSecond, we propose a functionality-aware body initialization module that synthesizes a human performing the task in the image and estimates the corresponding initial 3D body and hand poses.\\nTo mitigate hallucinations during human synthesis, we introduce a human inpainting optimization strategy that automatically evaluates and improves the generated human pose configuration.\\nIn addition, since image-based synthesis may produce left-right hand inconsistencies with the inferred contact graph, we further refine the contact graph to align contact specifications with the synthesized human.\\nFinally, a body refinement module places the initialized 3D human into the scene and performs stage-wise optimization to jointly refine body pose and human-scene contacts, ensuring both physical plausibility and functional correctness.\\n\\n\\nWe conduct experiments on the SceneFun3D dataset\\u00a0[4] under both functional and general human-scene interaction settings.\\nExtensive qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our design and the superior performance of our framework compared to existing baselines.\\nIn addition, we show that FunHSI is compatible with recent feed-forward 3D reconstruction methods, such as MapAnything\\u00a0[15], and can generate realistic human-scene interactions in reconstructed city scenes.\\nIn summary, our contributions are as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nWe propose FunHSI, a training-free framework that generates functionally correct human-scene interactions from open-vocabulary task prompts. FunHSI extends beyond general interactions to support functional interaction scenarios across diverse scenes and actions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nWe introduce a robust optimization strategy for inpainting humans and contact graph refinement scheme, providing valuable insights for functional human-scene interactions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that FunHSI achieves strong performance in both functional and general HSI tasks compared to existing baselines.

Mat. Fig.\\u00a011) and are fixed across all experiments.\\nWe then prompt a large language model (LLM), e.g., GPT-4o\\u00a0[25] or Gemini, with the task description, the detected functional elements, the predefined body-part set, and additional structured instructions that encourage task-complete and human-like interactions.\\nThe LLM outputs a contact graph \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G}, which specifies the involved body parts, the functional and supporting scene elements, and their corresponding contact relations (see Fig.\\u00a02).\\nSimilar to functional elements, inferred supporting elements (e.g., the floor) are segmented in each image and lifted to 3D masks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3 Functionality-aware Body Initialization\\n\\nAlthough the inferred contact graph \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G} provides high-level interaction constraints, directly fitting a 3D human body to the scene remains challenging due to the strong sensitivity of optimization-based methods to initialization.\\nTo obtain a reliable initial body configuration, we first synthesize a human performing the task in the image and then estimate the corresponding 3D body and hand poses.\\nSince image-based synthesis may introduce left-right inconsistencies with the inferred contact graph, we update the contact graph to align its laterality with the initialized human body.\\n\\n\\nHuman inpainting with contact-aware reasoning.\\n\\nWe employ a vision-language model (VLM), specifically Gemini\\u00a0[2], to synthesize human pixels in the input image.\\nTo encourage the generated human to perform the specified task and establish appropriate contacts with the scene, we introduce a contact-aware prompting strategy.\\nIn addition to the input image without humans and the task description, the inpainting prompt incorporates the inferred contact graph and the detected object bounding boxes.\\nThese cues explicitly specify task-relevant functional and supporting elements, guiding the model to generate human body parts in spatial proximity to the target objects.\\nHowever, image inpainting models may hallucinate, unintentionally altering scene structures or introducing spurious objects, as illustrated in Fig.\\u00a03.\\nTo mitigate this issue, we adopt an iterative generator-critic scheme inspired by LLM-based optimization\\u00a0[40].\\nA separate Gemini model is used as a critic to compare the inpainted image with the original input and verify that (1) the generated human performs the specified task, (2) contacts with functional elements are plausible, and (3) no irrelevant or non-existent objects are introduced.\\nIf any criterion is violated, the generator is prompted to regenerate the human appearance.\\nThis process is repeated until all criteria are satisfied or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\\nIn practice, we find that 3-4 iterations are sufficient and outperform single-pass image generation.\\n\\n\\nFigure 3: Visualization of the human inpainting optimization process. By automatically evaluating the human inpainting results, the image generation process is optimized to produce more reliable outcomes, thus strongly facilitating the subsequent body optimization step.\\n\\n\\n\\n3D human estimation.\\n\\nGiven the human-inpainted image, we estimate SMPL-X parameters to initialize the 3D human body.\\nSpecifically, we estimate the global translation \\ud835\\udc2b\\\\mathbf{r}, root orientation \\ud835\\udf4b\\\\bm{\\\\varphi}, and body pose \\ud835\\udf3db\\\\bm{\\\\theta}^{b} using CameraHMR\\u00a0[26], and estimate hand pose parameters \\ud835\\udf3dh\\\\bm{\\\\theta}^{h} using WiLoR\\u00a0[30].\\nFor cases where the hands are occluded in the image, \\ud835\\udf3dh\\\\bm{\\\\theta}^{h} is initialized to the default relaxed hand pose of SMPL-X.\\nThe estimated SMPL-X body is then transformed from the camera coordinate system to the world coordinate system using the known camera pose, ensuring that the human body and the scene are represented in a common reference frame.\\nThe resulting SMPL-X parameters provide a task-specific and geometrically plausible initialization, which substantially simplifies the subsequent body refinement stage.\\n\\n\\n\\nContact graph refinement.\\n\\nWe observe that image generation models may fail to consistently capture left-right spatial relations.\\nFor example, as shown in Fig\\u00a09, the synthesized image may depict the left hand contacting a handle, even when the inferred contact graph specifies contact with the right hand.\\nSuch laterality inconsistencies between the initialized body configuration and the contact graph can lead to invalid human-scene interactions during subsequent refinement.\\nTo address this issue, we refine the contact graph by aligning its laterality with the inpainted image.\\nSpecifically, we project the left and right wrist joints of the estimated 3D body onto the 2D image plane and compute their distances to the center

left-right swap to all hand-related nodes in the contact graph \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G} (e.g., palm and finger nodes).\\nOtherwise, the contact graph remains unchanged.\\nThis simple distance-based criterion is effective at resolving left-right ambiguities across different scenes and camera viewpoints.\\nThe refined contact graph is denoted as \\ud835\\udca2\\u2217\\\\mathcal{G}^{*}.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4 Optimization-based Body Refinement\\n\\nTo refine the body pose, global configurations, and the contact, a conventional solution is to jointly optimize all SMPL-X parameters.\\nHowever, we find in our trials that such joint optimization often leads to unrealistic HSI results, such as unnatural facing orientation and penetration to the scene.\\nTherefore, we propose a two-stage coarse-to-fine optimization method to gradually refine the initial body state.\\nThis will not only preserve nuances in the initial body pose, but also improve the body-scene contact, making the 3D human body performing the specified task.\\n\\n\\nOptimization objective.\\n\\nTo penalize body-scene interpenetration, we define a collision loss based on the signed distance field (SDF) of the SMPL-X body.\\nGiven a scene point cloud \\ud835\\udcab={\\ud835\\udc29j}j=1N\\\\mathcal{P}=\\\\{\\\\mathbf{p}_{j}\\\\}_{j=1}^{N}, the collision loss is formulated as\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2112col=\\u2211j=1Nmax\\u2061(0,\\u2212\\u03a8\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc29j;\\u03b2,r,\\u03c6,\\u03b8)),\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{col}}=\\\\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\\\max\\\\bigl(0,\\\\;-\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{p}_{j};\\\\beta,r,\\\\varphi,\\\\theta)\\\\bigr),\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u03a8\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc29j;\\u03b2,r,\\u03c6,\\u03b8)\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{p}_{j};\\\\beta,r,\\\\varphi,\\\\theta) denotes the SDF value of point \\ud835\\udc29j\\\\mathbf{p}_{j} with respect to the current SMPL-X body configuration, computed using VolumetricSMPL\\u00a0[24].\\nThis loss penalizes scene points that lie inside the body volume and evaluates to zero when no interpenetration occurs.\\n\\n\\nTo further enforce task-consistent body-scene contact, we introduce a contact loss guided by the refined contact graph \\ud835\\udca2\\u2217\\\\mathcal{G}^{*}.\\nFor each contact pair (b,o)\\u2208\\ud835\\udca2\\u2217(b,o)\\\\in\\\\mathcal{G}^{*}, where bb denotes a body part and oo a corresponding scene element, we minimize the distance between the body vertices \\ud835\\udcb1b\\\\mathcal{V}_{b} and the scene points \\ud835\\udcaeo\\\\mathcal{S}_{o} using a single-sided Chamfer distance:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2112con=\\u2211(b,o)\\u2208\\ud835\\udca2\\u22171|\\ud835\\udcb1b|\\u200b\\u2211\\ud835\\udc2f\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb1bmin\\ud835\\udc2c\\u2208\\ud835\\udcaeo\\u2061\\u2016\\ud835\\udc2f\\u2212\\ud835\\udc2c\\u201622.\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{con}}=\\\\sum_{(b,o)\\\\in\\\\mathcal{G}^{*}}\\\\frac{1}{|\\\\mathcal{V}_{b}|}\\\\sum_{\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{V}_{b}}\\\\min_{\\\\mathbf{s}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{S}_{o}}\\\\|\\\\mathbf{v}-\\\\mathbf{s}\\\\|_{2}^{2}.\\n\\n(4)\\n\\n\\nThe single-sided formulation pulls the body toward the intended contact surfaces without over-constraining the scene geometry.\\nFor foot contacts, the loss is computed only on vertices near the toes and heel, allowing fine-grained poses such as tiptoe standing.\\nTo regularize the pose space during optimization, we incorporate a VPoser prior\\u00a0[27].\\nSpecifically, we define\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2112prior=\\u2016\\ud835\\udc33\\u201622,\\ud835\\udc33=VPoserEnc\\u200b(\\u03b8b),\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{prior}}=\\\\|\\\\,\\\\mathbf{z}\\\\,\\\\|_{2}^{2},\\\\qquad\\\\mathbf{z}=\\\\mathrm{VPoserEnc}(\\\\theta^{b}),\\n\\n(5)\\n\\n\\nwhere VPoserEnc\\u200b(\\u22c5)\\\\mathrm{VPoserEnc}(\\\\cdot) denotes the VPoser encoder and \\ud835\\udc33\\\\mathbf{z} is encouraged to follow a standard normal distribution.\\nThe overall optimization objective is defined as\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2112=\\u03bbcol\\u200b\\u2112col+\\u03bbcon\\u200b\\u2112con+\\u03bbprior\\u200b\\u2112prior,\\\\mathcal{L}=\\\\lambda_{\\\\text{col}}\\\\,\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{col}}+\\\\lambda_{\\\\text{con}}\\\\,\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{con}}+\\\\lambda_{\\\\text{prior}}\\\\,\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{prior}},\\n\\n(6)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u03bbcol\\\\lambda_{\\\\text{col}}, \\u03bbcon\\\\lambda_{\\\\text{con}}, and \\u03bbprior\\\\lambda_{\\\\text{prior}} are scalar weighting coefficients.\\n\\n\\n\\nTwo-stage optimization strategy.\\n\\nAs summarized in Algorithm\\u00a01, the refinement is carried out in two stages.\\nIn the first stage, we optimize the 3D translation rr, the global body orientation around the gravity axis \\u03c6g\\\\varphi_{g}, and the arm pose parameters \\u03b8arm\\\\theta^{\\\\text{arm}}.\\nJointly optimizing the arm articulation and global translation enables the hands to reach and establish contact with the target functional elements specified by the task.\\nTo preserve physical realism, the global orientation is restricted to rotations around the gravity axis, which prevents unnatural body tilting while still allowing feasible interaction configurations and obstacle avoidance.\\nThe second stage focuses on improving physical plausibility and contact stability.\\nIn this stage, we optimize the full body pose \\u03b8\\\\theta together with the 3D translation rr, with particular emphasis on the ankle joints to ensure stable foot-ground contact.\\nA smaller learning rate \\u03b72\\\\eta_{2} (set to 15\\u200b\\u03b71\\\\frac{1}{5}\\\\eta_{1}) is adopted to allow subtle pose adjustments without disrupting the refined configuration.\\nThe pose prior loss

synthesis, we construct a benchmark derived from the SceneFun3D dataset\\u00a0[4].\\nWe select 30 indoor scenes with diverse layouts (living rooms, bedrooms, kitchens, and bathrooms), each containing three views with RGB images, depth maps, and mask annotations for key affordance elements (e.g., door handles, couches, and floors).\\nFor each scene, we consider two evaluation settings: functional HSI and general HSI.\\nThe functional HSI prompts are taken from SceneFun3D and specify only the intended goal (e.g., open the door, adjust the temperature), requiring models to infer the relevant functional elements.\\nIn contrast, general HSI uses manually annotated prompts that explicitly describe both the action and the target object (e.g., sit on the chair, stand in front of the window).\\nThis results in a total of 60 curated interaction tasks.\\nIn addition, we capture real-world city scenes from multi-view images using GeoCalib\\u00a0[36] and MapAnything\\u00a0[15] to

The symbol * denotes that the baselines are their modified versions for fair comparison.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvaluation Metrics.\\n\\nWe evaluate HSI synthesis using 4 complementary metrics, i.e. semantic consistency score (SCS), non-collision score (NCS), non-functional contact distance (N-FCD), and functional contact distance (FCD), respectively.\\nThe semantic consistency score measures the alignment between the synthesized 3D interaction and the input text prompt.\\nWe compute a CLIP score\\u00a0[31] by rendering each synthesized interaction into three views, extracting image-text cosine similarities using CLIP ViT-B/32, and averaging the scores across views.\\nFor non-collision score, we compute a non-collision score based on penetration between the SMPL-X body mesh and the reconstructed scene point cloud, following VolumetricSMPL\\u00a0[24].\\nFor non-functional contact distance, we use the average Chamfer distance between the human body mesh and supporting scene elements (e.g., the floor or chair).\\nThe functional contact distance assesses whether the synthesized interaction has appropriate contact with task-relevant functional elements, e.g., a hand touching a door handle in the task of \\u201copen the door\\u201d.\\nThis metric is computed as the Chamfer distance between the functional element region and the interacting human hands.\\n\\n\\n\\nBaselines.\\n\\nTo our knowledge, no existing method explicitly targets functional human-scene interactions in 3D.\\nWe therefore compare our approach with the most closely related baselines.\\nGenZI\\u00a0[18] synthesizes human appearances in individual views and reconstructs a 3D body via multi-view fitting.\\nFor a fair comparison, we adapt GenZI to operate on the same three posed RGB-D images used in our benchmark.\\nGenHSI\\u00a0[20] proposes a training-free pipeline for generating long human-scene interaction videos by combining keyframe planning, 3D-aware inpainting, and motion animation.\\nWe extend GenHSI with functional element detection, perform human inpainting from randomly sampled views, and apply its original body-fitting strategy to our inputs.\\nDue to these adaptations, the resulting baselines are denoted as GenZI* and GenHSI*, respectively.\\n\\n\\nFigure 4: Qualitative results on SceneFun3D for general human-scene interaction.\\nWe compare GenZI*, GenHSI*, and our FunHSI with non-functional prompts such as sitting, squatting, and walking.\\n\\n\\nFigure 5: Qualitative results on SceneFun3D for functional human-scene interaction.\\nGiven open-vocabulary functional commands (e.g., adjusting temperature, dialing a number, switching a radio station) and posed RGB-D inputs, we compare GenZI*, GenHSI*, and our FunHSI.\\nExisting methods struggle to reason about task intent and often interact with incorrect objects or miss fine-grained functional components.\\nIn contrast, FunHSI accurately identifies task-relevant functional elements and generates physically plausible 3D human poses that establish correct contacts with both large objects and small functional parts (e.g., knobs, dials, cabinet handles), demonstrating robust functional grounding and contact reasoning.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.1 Comparison to Baselines\\n\\nQuantitative Evaluation.\\n\\nTable\\u00a01 summarizes the quantitative comparison between our FunHSI method and the modified baselines.\\nOverall, FunHSI performs competitively in the general HSI setting and substantially outperforms the baselines in functional HSI.\\nFor general HSI, FunHSI achieves comparable semantic consistency (0.2498) while improving physical plausibility.\\nIn particular, it attains the lowest contact distance (0.7481), outperforming GenZI* (0.8496) and GenHSI* (0.7599), together with a slightly higher non-collision score (0.9929), indicating that improved contact quality is not achieved at the cost of increased body-scene penetration.\\nFor functional HSI, FunHSI consistently yields the best results, with the lowest functional contact distance (0.2968) and the lowest overall contact distance (0.1837), significantly outperforming GenZI* and GenHSI*.\\nAlthough GenHSI* achieves a marginally higher non-collision score (0.9925 vs. 0.9917), FunHSI maintains comparable physical plausibility and semantic consistency (0.2540).\\n\\n\\nFigure 6: Illustration of functionality awareness of FunHSI.\\nGiven the same 3D scene, FunHSI generates distinct human-scene interactions conditioned on different high-level task prompts.\\n\\n\\nFigure 7: Qualitative results on in-the-wild scenes.\\nWe show our FunHSI results on real-world scenes captured by smart phone in Munich.\\n\\n\\n\\nQualitative Evaluation.\\n\\nFig.\\u00a04 and Fig.\\u00a05 show qualitative comparisons under both general and functional human-scene interaction scenarios.\\nFor functional tasks that require identifying and interacting with task-relevant elements (e.g., operating knobs, opening drawers, or interacting with small appliances), the baseline methods often fail to localize the correct functional targets or produce inaccurate hand-object contacts.\\nIn contrast, FunHSI consistently grounds interactions on the appropriate functional elements and generates realistic human-scene interactions.\\nFor general interaction prompts such as sitting, squatting, or standing near scene objects, FunHSI produces perceptually plausible body poses and interactions, achieving performance comparable to the baseline methods.\\nFig.\\u00a06 further illustrates the functional awareness of FunHSI: given different high-level task prompts abouth the same scene or object, the generated bodies accomplish the intended tasks with diverse and appropriate poses.\\nAdditional visual results are provided in the supplementary material.\\n\\n\\n\\nGeneralization to City Scenes.\\n\\nFig.\\u00a07 presents qualitative results on in-the-wild city scenes captured using a smartphone in public spaces in a city.\\nGiven multi-view RGB images reconstructed into 3D scenes, FunHSI successfully generates plausible human-scene interactions for diverse real-world tasks, such as opening an emergency door, buying a parking ticket, and sitting on a bench.\\nDespite the challenges posed by cluttered environments, noisy geometry, and incomplete reconstructions, our method robustly grounds interactions to the correct functional elements and produces physically plausible body poses.\\nThese results demonstrate that FunHSI generalizes beyond curated indoor datasets and is compatible with real-world feedforward 3D reconstruction pipelines.\\nMore visualizations are provided in Fig.\\u00a012 of the supplementary material.\\n\\n\\nFigure 8: User study of 3D human\\u2013scene interaction synthesis on our curated dataset. Participants show a strong preference for our method over baselines (i.e., GenHSI\\u00a0[20] and GenZI\\u00a0[18]) under both functional and general HSI settings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.2 Perceptual User Study\\n\\nWe conduct a perceptual user study to evaluate the visual quality and interaction realism of synthesized 3D human\\u2013scene interactions.\\nThe study is performed on the SceneFun3D benchmark under both functional HSI and general HSI settings.\\nParticipants are presented with rendered interaction results generated by FunHSI and the baseline methods, and are asked to select the most plausible and realistic human\\u2013scene interaction for each task.\\nThe evaluation focuses on overall perceptual quality, including the appropriateness of body pose, physical plausibility of contact, and consistency with the given task prompt.\\nFig.\\u00a08 summarizes the user preference results.\\nOverall, FunHSI is strongly preferred over the baseline methods across all evaluation settings.\\nWhen taking GenHSI as a representative baseline, FunHSI achieves an overall preference rate of 71.1%.\\nWhen evaluated separately, FunHSI obtains a preference rate of 76.8% for functional HSI and 66.0% for general HSI, indicating a clear advantage in scenarios that require functional reasoning and affordance-aware interaction.\\nMoreover, the preference margins are more pronounced in functional HSI, indicating that users are particularly sensitive to correct functional grounding and realistic contact with task-relevant elements.\\nThese results demonstrate that FunHSI not only improves quantitative metrics, but also produces perceptually more convincing human\\u2013scene interactions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMethod\\nNCS \\u2191\\\\uparrow\\nN-FCD \\u2193\\\\downarrow\\nFCD

physically implausible interactions (red).\\nBy swapping left-right hand to align with the observed contacting hand in the image, our method produces correct and stable human-scene interactions (green).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3 Ablation Studies\\n\\nContact graph refinement.\\n\\nWe ablate the contact graph refinement module by directly using the initial contact graph predicted by the LLM, without aligning left-right relations to the inpainting image.\\nAs shown in Table\\u00a02 and Fig.\\u00a09, removing this refinement leads to degraded contact accuracy, particularly for supporting elements such as the floor, while only marginally affecting the functional distance.\\nThis behavior indicates that ambiguities in left-right correspondence between the contact graph and the generated image can cause failures in the body fitting stage, highlighting the importance of contact graph refinement for stable and accurate interactions.\\n\\n\\n\\nBody & hand pose estimation.\\n\\nWe evaluate the importance of body and hand pose estimation by removing this module from our pipeline and initializing the SMPL-X body with a T-pose prior to refinement.\\nAs shown in Table\\u00a02 and Fig.\\u00a010, this modification leads to consistent degradation across all metrics.\\nThis observation indicates that accurate body and hand pose estimation from the inpainted image plays a critical role in guiding the optimization.\\n\\n\\nFigure 10: Effect of body and hand pose initialization.\\nBody and hand pose initialization provides a consistent starting point, enabling correct hand placement and stable refinement for functional interactions.\\n\\n\\n\\nBody refinement.\\n\\nWe ablate the body refinement stage by directly using the estimated SMPL-X pose without further optimization.\\nAs shown in Table\\u00a02, this results in increased body-scene penetration and less realistic contacts, indicating that the initial pose alone is insufficient to resolve geometric inconsistencies.\\nThese results confirm the necessity of body refinement for producing physically plausible and functionally correct HSI.\\n\\n\\n\\nFunctional element detection.\\n\\nTo evaluate the impact of detection accuracy, we replace the predicted functional element masks with ground-truth annotations (i.e., oracle detection).\\nAs reported in Table\\u00a02, oracle detection leads to a noticeable reduction in functional contact distance (from 0.2968 to 0.2662) while preserving comparable non-collision performance.\\nThis improvement suggests that our generation framework can directly benefit from more robust upstream detection modules.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"5 Conclusion\": \"\\n\\n5 Conclusion\\n\\nIn this work, we studied the problem of functional human-scene interaction synthesis, where a human must reason about object functionality and establish appropriate physical contact to accomplish an open-vocabulary task in a novel 3D scene.\\nWe proposed FunHSI, a training-free and functionality-driven framework that generates 3D human-scene interactions from posed RGB-D observations and open-vocabulary task prompts, without relying on explicit action-object descriptions.\\nBy integrating functionality-aware contact graph reasoning, human initialization, and optimization-based body refinement, FunHSI bridges high-level task intent and physically plausible interaction.\\nExtensive evaluations on a benchmark derived from SceneFun3D show that FunHSI consistently outperforms existing baselines, particularly for functional interactions, while maintaining strong physical plausibility.\\nWe believe FunHSI represents a step toward more semantically grounded human-scene interaction synthesis and opens up future directions for long-horizon and real-world embodied interaction.\\n\\n\\nLimitations and future work.\\n\\nOur method currently focuses on single-step functional human-scene interactions, where a single human pose is synthesized to accomplish a given task.\\nAs a result, it does not explicitly model long-horizon or multi-step interactions that require sequential planning or temporal reasoning across multiple actions (e.g., opening a door and then walking through it).\\nExtending FunHSI to support temporally coherent, multi-step functional interactions remains an interesting direction for future work.\\nIn addition, the scales of city scenes are estimated from RGB images. Unifying the body and the scene scales is also a future work.\\n\\n\\n\", \"Acknowledgement\": \"\\nAcknowledgement\\n\\nWe sincerely thank Alexandros Delitzas and Francis Engelmann for the guidance on SceneFun3D, Priyanka Patel on the guidance of CameraHMR, Muhammed Kocabas for fruitful discussions on foundation models.\\nWe also sincerely thank Nitin Saini and Nathan Bajandas for kind help and explorations on Unreal Engine.

SMPL-X template\\u00a0[27]:\\nhead, left upper arm, right upper arm, left forearm, right forearm,\\nleft hand, right hand, back, buttocks,\\nleft thigh, right thigh, left calf, right calf, left foot, and right foot,\\nas illustrated in Fig.\\u00a011.\\nEach part corresponds to a fixed subset of vertices on the SMPL-X mesh, yielding consistent semantic labeling across different poses and body shapes.\\nSince functional interactions in indoor environments are primarily performed by the hands and often involve small-scale objects (e.g., knobs, switches, dials), we further introduce a fine-grained hand annotation.\\nSpecifically, each hand is subdivided into six sub-parts: one palm and five fingers.\\nEach sub-part is associated with a predefined vertex set on the SMPL-X mesh, as shown in Fig.\\u00a011.\\nThis design allows the representation of both whole-hand contacts (e.g., palm-handle) and finger-level functional interactions (e.g., index finger-button) without introducing unnecessary anatomical complexity.\\nThis hierarchical annotation plays a dual role in our pipeline.\\nFirst, it provides a structured and semantically grounded vocabulary for LLM-based contact graph reasoning, enabling the model to express contacts using interpretable body-part names (e.g., \\u201cleft index finger touches the switch\\u201d).\\nSecond, it establishes a direct mapping from contact semantics to geometric constraints: each contact node bb in the contact graph is mapped to its corresponding vertex set \\ud835\\udcb1b\\\\mathcal{V}_{b}, which is used to compute contact losses during body refinement.\\nBy grounding language-level contact reasoning in mesh-level geometry, this annotation enables precise functional interactions while maintaining physical plausibility.\\n\\n\", \"Appendix B Datasets Details\": \"\\n\\nAppendix B Datasets Details\\n\\nIndoor scenes from SceneFun3D\\u00a0[4].\\n\\nTo systematically evaluate both prior methods and our approach for human-scene interaction (HSI) synthesis under fair and controlled settings, we construct a new benchmark derived from the SceneFun3D dataset.\\nWe select 30 indoor scenes covering diverse spatial layouts and functional contexts, including living rooms, bedrooms, kitchens, and bathrooms.\\nAll scenes contain common household objects that afford human interaction, such as doors, drawers, cabinets, switches, radiators, and supporting furniture.\\nFor each scene, we provide three canonical RGB-D views captured from different viewpoints, where each view consists of an RGB image, a depth image, and pixel-level mask annotations for key affordance-bearing elements (e.g., door handles, knobs, floors, and supporting surfaces).\\nUsing known camera parameters, the three views are back-projected and fused into a unified 3D point cloud, which serves as the geometric input for all interaction synthesis methods.\\nFor each scene, we manually define two types of interaction settings: functional human-scene interaction (functional HSI) and non-functional human-scene interaction (general HSI).\\nFunctional HSI requires the human to interact with a specific functional element to accomplish a task objective (e.g., open the door, adjust the room temperature, dial a number on the telephone), while non-functional HSI involves generic body-scene interactions that do not rely on object functionality (e.g., sit on the floor, stand in front of the window).\\nEach interaction setting is paired with a single text prompt per scene, resulting in a total of 60 curated interaction tasks (30 functional and 30 non-functional).\\nThe functional interaction prompts are designed to cover a diverse range of manipulation affordances, including pinch_pull, hook_pull, tip_push, rotate, plug_in, unplug, and key_press.\\nMost tasks involve fine-grained hand-object interactions, intentionally emphasizing functional reasoning and precise contact modeling rather than coarse body placement alone.\\nAll methods are evaluated on the same set of scenes, views, and text prompts without additional training or scene-specific tuning.\\nThe reconstructed scene geometry and affordance annotations are reused across different interaction prompts within each scene to ensure consistent and fair comparison.\\n\\n\\n\\nReal-world city scenes.\\n\\nTo evaluate the generalization ability of FunHSI under open-world conditions, we additionally collect a set of real-world city scenes captured in public environments.\\nAll data are captured using an iPhone 14 Pro Max. For each scene, we take multiple RGB images from different viewpoints. We use GeoCalib\\u00a0[36] to estimate the camera intrinsic parameters and the gravity direction, and use MapAnything\\u00a0[15] to estimate the camera poses, the depth maps, and the 3D scene point cloud.\\n\\n\\nThe collected scenes include diverse outdoor and semi-outdoor environments such as building entrances, staircases, ticket machines, escalators, benches, and public facilities, featuring challenging factors including clutter, reflective surfaces, varying illumination, and unconstrained object layouts.\\nWe apply the same processing pipeline as in indoor scenes without any scene-specific tuning.\\nThis experimental setting allows us to assess whether FunHSI can generalize beyond curated indoor datasets and reliably synthesize function-aware human-scene interactions in real-world, unconstrained environments.\\n\\n\\n\", \"Appendix C Implementation Details\": \"\\n\\nAppendix C Implementation Details\\n\\nAll our experiments are conducted on a single NVIDIA A6000 GPU.\\nFor functionality grounding and contact reasoning, we use Gemini-2.5-Flash for functional element identification, Gemini Robotics-ER-1.5 for bounding box localization, and GPT-4o for contact graph generation.\\nAll vision-language model queries are performed in a zero-shot manner, without task-specific fine-tuning.\\nScene reconstruction is performed by back-projecting three posed RGB-D views into a unified point cloud using known camera parameters.\\nFunctional and supporting elements are segmented using SAM-ViT-H and lifted into 3D.\\nThe reconstructed scene geometry and functional element annotations are cached and reused across different interaction prompts within the same scene.\\nHuman body initialization is obtained via image-space human inpainting using Gemini.\\nTo reduce hallucinations, we apply a generator-evaluator loop with at most four iterations.\\nInitial 3D human parameters are estimated using CameraHMR\\u00a0[26] for body pose and WiLoR\\u00a0[30] for hand pose.\\nFor occluded hands, we initialize the hand pose using the relaxed SMPL-X default configuration.\\nBody refinement is performed using the two-stage optimization procedure described in Algorithm\\u00a01.\\nWe use the AdamW optimizer for both stages.\\nIn Stage\\u00a01, we optimize the 3D translation, gravity-axis global rotation, and arm pose parameters for K1=400K_{1}=400 iterations with learning rate \\u03b71=1\\u00d710\\u22122\\\\eta_{1}=1\\\\times 10^{-2}.\\nIn Stage\\u00a02, we optimize the full body pose and translation for K2=200K_{2}=200 iterations using a reduced learning rate \\u03b72=\\u03b71/5\\\\eta_{2}=\\\\eta_{1}/5, together with the VPoser prior.\\nUnless otherwise specified, all hyperparameters are fixed across scenes and prompts.\\n\\n\", \"Appendix D More Experimental Analysis\": \"\\n\\nAppendix D More Experimental Analysis\\n\\nAdditional results on real-world cenes.\\n\\nFig.\\u00a012 presents additional qualitative results of our FunHSI on real-world scenes captured in public environments.\\nThese scenes exhibit significantly higher visual and geometric complexity than indoor datasets, including cluttered backgrounds, irregular lighting conditions, reflective surfaces, and diverse object appearances.\\nGiven three posed RGB-D views and a task-level text prompt, FunHSI successfully synthesizes functionally appropriate human-scene interactions without scene-specific tuning.\\nAs shown in the figure, our method correctly identifies task-relevant functional elements and generates plausible interactions for a wide range of actions, such as taking escalators or elevators, buying tickets from vending machines, opening doors, pinning objects to a whiteboard, and interacting with urban furniture.\\nThese results demonstrate that FunHSI generalizes beyond curated indoor datasets and is capable of handling open-world scenes while preserving functional grounding, contact correctness, and physical plausibility.\\n\\n\\n\\nGeneration Diversity.\\n\\nFig.\\u00a013 illustrates the diversity of human-scene interactions generated by FunHSI under the same scene and task prompt.\\nFor each example, we visualize multiple valid 3D human poses that differ in body configuration, viewpoint, and spatial arrangement, while consistently preserving the intended functional contact.\\nSpecifically, FunHSI produces diverse interaction realizations for tasks such as opening a drawer, dialing a telephone, and opening a door, all of which maintain correct contact with the task-relevant functional elements.\\nThese variations arise from differences in initial image synthesis and subsequent geometric refinement, rather than changes in task specification.\\nThis result demonstrates that FunHSI does not collapse to a single canonical pose, but instead supports diverse yet functionally consistent human-scene interaction generation.\\n\\n\\n\\nHuman Inpainting Examples.\\n\\nFig.\\u00a03 presents representative examples of task-conditioned human inpainting in our pipeline.\\nGiven an input RGB image and a task-level functional prompt, the inpainting model synthesizes a human that is spatially consistent with the scene layout and roughly aligned with the intended interaction region.\\nImportantly, the inpainted humans already reflect coarse functional intent (e.g., reaching, crouching, or bending), providing a semantically meaningful and visually grounded initialization that reduces ambiguity in subsequent 3D reconstruction.\\n\\n\\n\\nBody and Hand Pose Estimation Examples.\\n\\nBased on the inpainted images in Fig.\\u00a03, we estimate the initial 3D SMPL-X body pose together with articulated hand poses.\\nThe estimated poses capture coarse body configuration and hand-object alignment in image space, including which hand is used and its approximate contact location.\\nThese estimates serve as strong initialization for our geometry-aware body refinement, significantly improving optimization stability, accelerating convergence, and reducing failure cases such as incorrect hand assignment or implausible body configurations.\\n\\n\\nFigure 15: \\nLayout

Users choose the result they prefer according to our criteria, and we report the percentage of cases in which the baseline is preferred over our method.\\nThe layout of the perceptual study is shown in Fig.\\u00a015.\\n\\n\\nWe take several precautions in our study design to ensure reliable results. We only allow participants that are experienced (\\u22655000\\\\geq 5000 accepted submissions) and highly rated (\\u226598%\\\\geq 98\\\\% acceptance rate).\\nEach assignment contains 36 comparisons, i.e. pairs of images. The first three are intended as warm-up tasks, and the answers to these are discarded during evaluation. There are three so-called catch trials scattered among the remainder of the assignment. These are intentionally very obvious comparisons that help us identify participants who are providing random inputs. We discard all submissions where even a single one of the three catch trials is failed: 25 out of a total of 120 completions. To further reduce bias, the order of the comparisons is shuffled within an assignment, and the two sides of each comparison are randomly swapped too.\\n\\n\"}, \"bibliography\": {\"[1]\": \"\\n[1]\\nB.

Recent systems  (lu2024aiscientist; yamada2025aiscientistv2; gottweis_towards_2025) demonstrate that LLM-based agents can autonomously execute an end-to-end research loop, including literature review, code generation, experiment execution, and manuscript drafting. These results suggest that automated scientific discovery is becoming practically feasible and that LLM-based agents are approaching a level of functional completeness required for autonomous research (jin_agentreview_2024; sahu_reviewertoo_2025; ajith2024litsearch; zhang_noveltybench_2025; zhang2026opennovelty).\\n\\n\\nDespite this progress, existing systems remain constrained by a fundamental inefficiency in their execution paradigm, which limits their scalability and robustness in practice. In particular, most current research agents (wang_openhands_2025; yang_swe-agent_2024; mitchener_kosmos_2025; luo2025llm4sr) rely on an on-the-spot computation strategy, where nearly all information acquisition, reasoning, and synthesis are performed online at runtime. Under this paradigm, each new research attempt requires the agent to dynamically retrieve large volumes of scientific literature, read and summarize long and heterogeneous documents in real time, and explore a broad space of candidate methods and experimental designs through open-ended generation and trial-and-error. As a result, the cost of producing a single effective scientific discovery remains substantial. For example, a complete execution of the overall pipeline often requires several hours and, in some cases, up to 15 hours to progress from ideation to experimentation (lu2024aiscientist). Similarly, in (schmidgall_agent_2025), literature review and experimental planning alone account for a significant portion of total inference time and place heavy demands on the language model\\u2019s ability to maintain coherent reasoning over long contexts. More importantly, this runtime-centric design repeatedly forces the model to re-process large volumes of unstructured and partially redundant information, even when much of the underlying scientific knowledge is already well established, thereby increasing computational overhead and exacerbating the risk of hallucination and reasoning errors (wang2025repomaster; shin_mind_2025).\\n\\n\\nTo address the efficiency and reliability limitations of existing autonomous research agents, we propose Idea2Story, a scientific discovery framework that explicitly separates offline knowledge construction from online research generation, with the goal of reducing repeated reasoning over scientific literature and alleviating the context window bottleneck of large language models. Most current systems rely on runtime-centric execution, where agents repeatedly retrieve, read, summarize, and reason over large collections of highly overlapping papers for each new research attempt, resulting in substantial computational cost and prolonged execution time. Idea2Story mitigates this inefficiency by shifting literature understanding from online reasoning to an offline stage. In the offline phase, the system periodically collects recently accepted, peer-reviewed papers together with their full review feedback, extracts core methodological units and research patterns, and organizes these units and their observed composition relations into a continuously updated structured knowledge graph. This knowledge graph serves as a compact and reusable representation of established scientific methods and their empirical compatibility, replacing repeated processing of raw documents at runtime. Building on this offline knowledge infrastructure, Idea2Story performs online research generation by aligning underspecified user research intents with existing research paradigms encoded in the knowledge graph. Rather than relying on open-ended generation and trial-and-error, the system retrieves high-quality research patterns as structured compositions of method units, which act as stable methodological blueprints for downstream experimental design and execution. Guided by these validated research patterns, Idea2Story conducts feasibility-driven experimentation and ultimately generates a complete, submission-ready paper in an end-to-end manner.\\n\\n\\nFigure 1:  Overview of the two-stage framework in Idea2Story. The offline stage constructs a structured knowledge graph by extracting and organizing reusable method units from a curated paper corpus. The online stage retrieves and composes research patterns from the knowledge graph to ground underspecified user intent into concrete and coherent research directions.\\n\\n\\nOur work makes the following contributions to autonomous scientific discovery :\\n(1) We introduce Idea2Story, a framework that formalizes autonomous research as a\\npre-computation\\u2013driven process, where scientific knowledge is extracted, structured, and\\nmaintained in a continuously updated methodological knowledge graph, addressing the inefficiency and\\nunreliability of runtime-centric research agents. (2) We propose a knowledge-grounded planning and execution pipeline that alleviates the context window bottleneck and reduces repeated runtime reasoning over literature by converting paper reading into retrieval over a pre-built knowledge graph. (3) We conduct preliminary empirical studies and comparative evaluations, demonstrating that Idea2Story can produce several high-quality research demos and establishing the practical feasibility of the proposed paradigm in an end-to-end setting.\\n\\n\", \"2 Related Work\": \"\\n\\n2 Related Work\\n\\n\\n2.1 Autonomous Scientific Discovery\\n\\nRecent advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven growing interest in autonomous scientific\\ndiscovery agents that aim to automate the full research lifecycle, from code generation to experimental\\nexecution  (hu_controlled_2026; zhang2025evolving; lin_se-agent_2025). Early systems such as The AI Scientist (v1) (lu2024aiscientist) demonstrate the\\nviability of end-to-end automation but rely heavily on manually crafted code templates and largely\\nlinear exploration workflows, which restrict discovery depth and adaptability. Later approaches, including\\nThe AI Scientist-v2 (yamada2025aiscientistv2) and Kosmos (mitchener_kosmos_2025), reduce reliance on\\nexplicit template through the incorporation of agentic tree search and experiment management agents, enabling iterative and multi-round exploration.\\n\\n\\nIn research ideation, LLM-generated ideas are often perceived as highly novel during initial screening; however, prior studies (si2024can) uncover a critical paradox whereby such ideas tend to underperform after implementation relative to human-generated ideas, indicating limited feasibility and practical\\nutility. As more ideas are generated, LLM outputs exhibit growing similarity, leading to diminished meaningful diversity. Similar limitations have also been observed in research evaluation and peer\\nreview (liang2024can; xu2025can; thakkar_can_2025; zhang2026opennovelty). Existing AI-based reviewers display systematic blind\\nspots: shin_mind_2025 shows that LLM reviewers place disproportionate\\nemphasis on technical correctness while undervaluing novelty, deviating from human\\nexpert judgment, while sahu_reviewertoo_2025 demonstrates that AI reviewers\\nstruggle to distinguish fine-grained acceptance categories and are susceptible to sycophancy, with\\nreview scores increasing unreasonably after exposure to author rebuttals. Although recent approaches\\nsuch as AgentReview (jin_agentreview_2024) seek to mitigate these deficiencies by simulating\\ndiverse reviewer roles, automated evaluation systems remain less reliable than human experts in\\nidentifying robust accept/reject decision boundaries.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2.2 LLM-Driven Agents\\n\\nLLM-driven agents still struggle to interact effectively with complex real-world environments.\\nDespite their strong generative capabilities, many existing systems\\u2014such as OpenHands (wang_openhands_2025)\\nand SWE-Agent (yang_swe-agent_2024)\\u2014exhibit limited performance when applied to realistic\\ncodebases. These limitations largely stem from insufficient reasoning over hierarchical dependencies\\nand structural constraints, as well as the inherent restrictions imposed by finite context windows.\\nAs a result, LLM-driven agents achieve relatively low task completion rates on challenging benchmarks\\nsuch as MLE-bench (chan_mlebench_2024) and SciCode (tian_scicode_2024).\\nRepoMaster (wang2025repomaster) further identifies inadequate modeling of codebase structure,\\nincluding function call graphs and module dependency graphs, as a key bottleneck for LLM-driven agents\\noperating in large and complex environments.\\n\\n\\nBeyond execution limitations, LLM-driven agents also exhibit notable deficiencies in scientific rigor\\nand evaluative judgment. When tasked with autonomous assessment, these agents are prone to hallucination and overconfidence. For instance, Agent Laboratory (schmidgall_agent_2025) reports that automated evaluations produced by LLM-driven agents substantially overestimate paper quality compared to human reviewers. Evaluations of Kosmos (mitchener_kosmos_2025) further reveal a tendency to invent opaque quantitative metrics and to conflate statistical significance with scientific value, leading to weak interpretability of experimental conclusions. Moreover, long-horizon autonomous execution exacerbates these issues by introducing behavioral\\ndrift (arike2025tech), where LLM-driven agents gradually deviate from intended research trajectories or generate overly strong and insufficiently justified claims (lu2024aiscientist; schmidgall2025agent; baek_researchagent_2025; hong_metagpt_2023; wu_autogen_2023; lin_se-agent_2025; hu_controlled_2026). This drift further undermines reliability and highlights the\\nneed for stronger structural grounding and validation mechanisms in LLM-based autonomous research\\nsystems.\\n\\n\\n\", \"3 General Idea Generation\": \"\\n\\n3 General Idea Generation\\n\\nIdea2Story is designed to interact with users through high-level and often informal research ideas\\nthat reflect human intuition rather than fully specified technical plans.

This stage consists of three\\nmain components: (i) constructing a curated paper pool from peer-reviewed venues, (ii) extracting\\ncore method units that represent reusable methodological contributions, and (iii) organizing these\\nunits and their composition relations into a structured knowledge graph. Together, these components\\nform a persistent methodological memory that decouples literature understanding from downstream\\nidea grounding and research generation.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1.1 Paper Pool Construction\\n\\nWe construct a paper pool from accepted machine learning papers and their associated peer reviews\\ncollected from top-tier conferences.

The introduction is used to identify the\\nhigh-level research motivation and the precise problem formulation, the method section provides\\nsignals about core technical mechanisms such as modeling assumptions, learning objectives, model\\narchitectures, and optimization strategies, and the experiments section reflects how these\\nmechanisms are instantiated and evaluated in practice. By jointly aggregating information from\\nthese sections, the extractor isolates method units that correspond to the primary algorithmic or\\nmodeling contributions of the paper, rather than surface-level experimental details.\\n\\n\\nWe define a method unit u\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb0pu\\\\in\\\\mathcal{U}_{p} as a self-contained description of how a research\\nproblem is formulated or solved, abstracted away from specific implementation choices and\\nexperimental configurations. Elements that primarily involve dataset selection, hyperparameter\\ntuning, or engineering-level optimizations are excluded unless they induce substantive changes to\\nthe problem formulation, model structure, or learning objective. In practice, most papers yield one\\nor a small number of method units. Each extracted unit is further normalized into structured\\nmethodological attributes, including atomic meta-methods, which correspond to indivisible\\nmethodological elements, and composition-level patterns, which describe how multiple method\\nunits are combined within a single paper.\\n\\n\\nAfter extracting method units for all papers, we represent each paper p\\u2208\\ud835\\udcab~p\\\\in\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}}\\nby a vector embedding derived from its associated method units. Formally, let\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc33p=g\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb0p),\\\\mathbf{z}_{p}=g(\\\\mathcal{U}_{p}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udcb0p\\\\mathcal{U}_{p} denotes the set of extracted method units for paper pp and\\ng\\u200b(\\u22c5)g(\\\\cdot) is an embedding function that maps a set of method units to a fixed-dimensional\\nrepresentation.\\n\\n\\nTo induce higher-level research patterns, we first apply a nonlinear dimensionality reduction\\noperator\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc32p=UMAP\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc33p),\\\\mathbf{y}_{p}=\\\\mathrm{UMAP}(\\\\mathbf{z}_{p}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhich projects the high-dimensional embeddings into a lower-dimensional space while preserving\\nlocal semantic neighborhoods. We then perform density-based clustering on the reduced\\nrepresentations using DBSCAN, yielding a partition\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9e={C1,\\u2026,CM},\\\\mathcal{C}=\\\\{C_{1},\\\\dots,C_{M}\\\\},\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere each cluster Cm\\u2282\\ud835\\udcab~C_{m}\\\\subset\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}} corresponds to a coherent research pattern.\\n\\n\\nThese induced clusters serve as higher-level abstractions over individual papers, capturing\\nrecurring methodological structures that are reused across the literature. The resulting research\\npatterns form the basis for subsequent retrieval and composition.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2:  Offline knowledge graph construction in Idea2Story. Academic papers and their associated review artifacts are first anonymized and safety-filtered, then deconstructed into layered methodological representations. These layers capture complementary aspects of a paper, including its core research idea, domain context, high-level story skeleton, and packaging actions. The extracted elements are normalized into atomic method units and meta-methods, which are connected through composition and similarity relations. Reviewer feedback is incorporated as additional signals to refine relations and validate abstractions. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1.3 Knowledge Graph Construction\\n\\nBuilding on the extracted method units, we organize reusable methodological components into a\\nstructured knowledge graph that supports systematic method discovery and composition. While\\nindividual method units capture isolated algorithmic or modeling ideas, effective research methods\\nin practice typically arise from structured combinations of multiple method units. The knowledge\\ngraph provides a unified representation that explicitly encodes canonicalized method units,\\nmeta-methods, and their empirically observed composition relations in prior work.\\n\\n\\nFormally, we define the knowledge graph as a directed graph\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udca2=(\\ud835\\udcb1,\\u2130),\\\\mathcal{G}=(\\\\mathcal{V},\\\\mathcal{E}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere each node v\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb1v\\\\in\\\\mathcal{V} corresponds to a canonicalized method unit or a meta-method.\\nCanonicalization groups semantically similar method units across the corpus into shared\\nmeta-method abstractions, reducing surface-level variation while preserving core methodological\\nintent. As a result, nodes in the graph represent atomic or minimally indivisible methodological\\nelements that are reused across papers.\\n\\n\\nEdges in the graph encode composition relations between method units. For a given paper\\np\\u2208\\ud835\\udcab~p\\\\in\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}} with extracted method unit set \\ud835\\udcb0p\\\\mathcal{U}_{p}, we add directed edges\\nbetween pairs of method units (ui,uj)\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb0p\\u00d7\\ud835\\udcb0p(u_{i},u_{j})\\\\in\\\\mathcal{U}_{p}\\\\times\\\\mathcal{U}_{p} to indicate that\\nthey are jointly instantiated as part of the same methodological pipeline. These edges capture\\nempirical evidence of method compatibility observed in prior work, reflecting how different\\nmethod units are combined in practice rather than hypothetical or manually specified relations.\\n\\n\\nAggregating composition relations across the full corpus yields a graph structure that encodes both\\nmethodological abstraction and empirical compatibility. In particular, the graph captures two\\ncomplementary levels of structure: (i) reusable methodological elements represented as\\ncanonicalized method units and meta-methods, and (ii) composition constraints induced from\\nco-occurrence statistics in accepted papers. This separation allows Idea2Story to reason about\\nmethods at a higher level of abstraction than individual papers, while remaining grounded in\\nobserved research practice.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2 Online Research Generation.\\n\\nGiven a target research objective, Idea2Story treats method discovery as a graph-based retrieval and\\ncomposition problem over \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G}. The system retrieves relevant subgraphs and composes\\ncompatible method units by following connectivity constraints in the graph, producing candidate\\nresearch patterns that correspond to structured combinations of method units. These research\\npatterns serve as high-level methodological blueprints that bridge abstract research intent and\\nconcrete experimental design, enabling downstream planning, feasibility analysis, and end-to-end\\npaper generation.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2.1 Research Pattern Retrieval\\n\\nGiven a user-provided research idea expressed in natural language, we formulate research pattern\\nidentification as a structured retrieval problem over the knowledge graph \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G}. Let\\nqq denote the input research idea, and let \\ud835\\udc9e={C1,\\u2026,CM}\\\\mathcal{C}=\\\\{C_{1},\\\\dots,C_{M}\\\\} denote the set of\\nresearch patterns induced from the paper corpus. The goal is to rank patterns in \\ud835\\udc9e\\\\mathcal{C}\\naccording to their relevance to qq.\\n\\n\\nRather than relying on a single similarity metric, Idea2Story adopts a multi-view retrieval\\nformulation that aggregates complementary signals from different semantic abstractions. Formally,\\nfor each research pattern CmC_{m}, we compute a relevance score\\n\\n\\n\\ns\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)=\\u2211v\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb1\\u03bbv\\u200bsv\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q),s(C_{m}\\\\mid q)=\\\\sum_{v\\\\in\\\\mathcal{V}}\\\\lambda_{v}\\\\,s_{v}(C_{m}\\\\mid q),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udcb1={idea,domain,paper}\\\\mathcal{V}=\\\\{\\\\text{idea},\\\\text{domain},\\\\text{paper}\\\\} indexes the retrieval views,\\nsv\\u200b(\\u22c5)s_{v}(\\\\cdot) denotes a view-specific scoring function, and \\u03bbv\\\\lambda_{v} are fixed weighting\\ncoefficients that balance the contribution of different views.\\n\\n\\nIdea-level retrieval.\\n\\nAt the idea level, the system retrieves previously observed research ideas that are semantically\\nsimilar to the input query qq.

In each iteration, a large language model is prompted to act as a reviewer\\nand evaluate the current research pattern along several predefined criteria, including technical\\nsoundness, novelty with respect to existing literature, and overall clarity of the problem\\u2013method\\nalignment. The reviewer produces both scalar judgments and concrete revision suggestions.\\n\\n\\nThe system then uses this feedback to update the research pattern in a targeted manner. When the\\nreview indicates insufficient novelty, the system modifies the pattern by recombining compatible\\nmethod units or introducing alternative realizations within the same pattern family. When the\\nreview identifies issues in feasibility or ambiguity in formulation, the system revises the problem\\ndefinition or method structure to improve consistency and executability. Each revised pattern is\\nre-submitted to the same review process, forming an explicit generate\\u2013review\\u2013revise loop.\\n\\n\\nTo prevent uncontrolled drift, only revisions that improve the reviewer scores are retained;\\notherwise, the system rolls back to the previous version. This process repeats until the reviewer\\njudges the pattern to be sufficiently novel, coherent, and technically plausible, or until further\\niterations no longer yield improvement. The output of this stage is a refined research pattern that\\nhas been iteratively vetted by an LLM-based reviewer and is suitable for downstream validation and\\npaper generation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"4 Experiments and Analysis\": \"\\n\\n4 Experiments and Analysis\\n\\nWe evaluate Idea2Story through a set of experiments focusing on its ability to extract reusable\\nmethodological structure and to generate high-quality research patterns from ambiguous user input.\\nOur experiments are conducted on a corpus of accepted papers from ICLR and NeurIPS over the past\\nthree years, including approximately 13K papers and their associated peer reviews, which serves as\\nthe foundation for all subsequent analyses. Based on this corpus, we first analyze the properties of the extracted method units to assess whether Idea2Story captures meaningful and reusable methodological abstractions. We then present qualitative demonstrations of research patterns instantiated as structured research stories, illustrating how the system transforms vague research intent into coherent and methodologically grounded research directions.\\n\\n\\n\\nCase 1: Method Unit Extraction Demo\\n\\n\\nPaper Title:\\nLearning Dynamics of LLM Finetuning\\nBase Problem:\\nUnderstanding how specific training examples influence model predictions during finetuning is challenging, particularly in large language models.\\nSolution Pattern:\\nDevelop a framework to analyze step-wise influence accumulation among potential responses during finetuning, providing insights into phenomena like hallucination and the squeezing effect in off-policy direct preference optimization.\\nStory:\\nReframe the understanding of LLM finetuning through the lens of learning dynamics, offering a unified interpretation of training behaviors and inspiring methods to enhance model alignment and performance.\\nApplication:\\nImproving alignment in large language models, enhancing finetuning strategies for better model performance, diagnosing and mitigating hallucination in AI systems.\\n\\nFigure 3: An example of a method unit extracted from an accepted paper, illustrating the separation of the base problem, solution pattern, and higher-level research story.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.1 Implementation Details\\n\\nTo further assess the effectiveness of Idea2Story in practical research ideation settings, we\\nconduct additional qualitative experiments on a small set of representative cases. Specifically,\\nwe evaluate three user-provided research ideas curated by an external collaborator. For each case,\\nIdea2Story generates research patterns using the GLM-4.7 (zeng2025glm) model as the underlying language backbone. As a baseline, we compare against direct LLM generation, where the same model is prompted to produce a complete research story without explicit pattern modeling or retrieval.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.2 Case Study: Method Unit Extraction\\n\\nWe present a representative case study to illustrate the behavior of the proposed method unit\\nextraction agent. Case 1 shows an example extracted from an accepted paper, where the system decomposes the full paper into a structured set of methodological elements.\\n\\n\\nAs shown in the example, the extracted method unit explicitly separates the underlying research\\nproblem, the core solution pattern, and the resulting research story. The Base Problem describes the core challenge addressed by the paper, namely understanding how individual training examples influence model behavior during finetuning, without depending on specific datasets or implementation details. The Solution Pattern summarizes the central methodological idea as\\nan analysis framework for step-wise influence accumulation, highlighting the key mechanism without\\nbinding it to a particular optimization setup or experimental configuration. Importantly, the extracted Story reframes the technical contribution at a higher level of\\nabstraction, connecting learning dynamics to broader phenomena such as hallucination and alignment\\nin large language models. This abstraction reflects how the method unit goes beyond algorithmic\\ndetails to capture the conceptual contribution of the paper. Finally, the Application\\nfield grounds the method unit by indicating downstream research and system-level implications,\\nwithout enumerating task-specific benchmarks.\\n\\n\\nThis example demonstrates that the extraction agent isolates reusable methodological structure while\\nfiltering out implementation-level details. By representing the paper as a coherent method unit\\nrather than a collection of experimental components, Idea2Story enables subsequent reuse,\\ncomparison, and composition of methodological ideas across papers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3 Knowledge Graph Analysis\\n\\nWe analyze the structure of the constructed knowledge graph to understand how extracted method\\nunits are distributed across papers and research domains. As illustrated in Figure 2, the graph\\nexhibits a clear hub-and-spoke structure, where a small number of high-frequency domains connect\\nto a large number of papers and research patterns. This reflects the uneven distribution of\\nresearch activity across domains, while also highlighting domains that function as central hubs\\nfor methodological reuse. Importantly, many research patterns are observed to connect multiple\\ndomains simultaneously, indicating that the extracted method units often capture methodological\\nabstractions that generalize beyond a single application area. In contrast, paper-level nodes are typically associated with a single domain, whereas pattern-level nodes frequently act as bridges between otherwise weakly connected domains.

The main challenge is semantic sparsity caused by short and ambiguous queries.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCore Research Gap\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExisting intent classification methods treat queries in isolation and ignore domain-specific structural priors in e-commerce. They fail to exploit rich relationships between products and attributes, and standard vocabularies struggle with long-tail, domain-specific terminology. No prior work unifies diffusion-based refinement with structural graph embeddings for intent disambiguation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrior work suffers from (1) context isolation, where behavioral signals such as clicks are underutilized, and (2) a flat-label assumption that ignores the hierarchical nature of e-commerce taxonomies, leading to inconsistent predictions for fine-grained, long-tail intents.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMethod Skeleton\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA diffusion-based classifier that iteratively denoises intent representations; a context-aware discrete tokenizer based on a VQ-VAE variant to encode diverse e-commerce queries; and integration of pretrained product graph embeddings as structural priors during the denoising process.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA dual-stream discriminative architecture consisting of a BERT-based text encoder, a lightweight GNN for aggregating behavioral interaction graphs, and a prediction head trained with hierarchical contrastive learning; parameter-efficient adaptation via LoRA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInnovation Claims\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(1) Reformulates intent classification as a diffusion-based dynamic refinement process;\\n(2) Introduces discrete, context-aware intent tokenization to better handle long-tail domain vocabulary;\\n(3) Enhances intent reasoning by incorporating product graph structural embeddings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(1) Contextualized intent modeling via joint reasoning over text and behavioral graphs;\\n(2) Hierarchical contrastive learning leveraging product taxonomies;\\n(3) Parameter-efficient system design achieving strong performance at reduced computational cost.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 1: \\nComparison of research patterns generated by Idea2Story and a direct LLM baseline,\\nboth starting from the same underspecified user input:\\n\\u201cI want to build an e-commerce agent that can better understand user intent.\\u201d\\nThe table contrasts how different generation mechanisms transform the same vague research intent\\ninto concrete research patterns.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.4 Qualitative Comparison of Generated Research Patterns\\n\\nWe further compare the quality of research patterns generated by Idea2Story and a direct LLM\\nbaseline. Both systems start from the same underspecified user input and produce structured\\nresearch proposals, enabling a controlled comparison of how different generation mechanisms\\ntransform vague research intent into concrete research patterns.\\n\\n\\nTable 1 presents a side-by-side comparison of representative outputs along multiple dimensions,\\nincluding problem formulation, methodological structure, and innovation claims. Rather than\\nevaluating surface-level writing quality, the comparison focuses on the resulting research\\npatterns as methodological blueprints\\u2014i.e., how the generated ideas frame the research problem,\\nidentify gaps in prior work, and organize methodological components into a coherent approach. As shown in the table, Idea2Story tends to induce higher-level problem reformulation, transforming\\nintent understanding from a fixed classification task into a dynamic structural reasoning process.\\nThe resulting research pattern emphasizes generative refinement, structural priors, and evolving\\nrepresentations. In contrast, the direct LLM baseline largely operates within a conventional task\\nformulation, proposing a stronger system through the integration of additional components such as\\ncontext modeling and hierarchical objectives.\\n\\n\\nTo reduce evaluation bias, the generated research stories from both approaches are subsequently\\nassessed by an independent large language model (Gemini 3 Pro) (team2025gemma), which is not involved in either generation process. The evaluator is instructed to compare the outputs in terms of novelty, methodological substance, and overall research quality, without access to the generation method\\nused. Across all evaluated cases, the externally evaluated results consistently favor the outputs\\ngenerated by Idea2Story. In particular, the research stories produced by direct LLM generation tend\\nto remain at a high level of abstraction, with less concrete methodological grounding and reliance\\non relatively standard techniques. In contrast, Idea2Story-generated research patterns exhibit\\nclearer problem framing, more specific methodological structures, and stronger signals of novelty.\\n\\n\\n\", \"5 Future Work\": \"\\n\\n5 Future Work\\n\\nWhile Idea2Story focuses on grounding vague research intent into structured and high-quality research patterns, an important direction for future work is to extend this framework toward a fully closed-loop research generation pipeline. A promising extension is the integration of experiment-driven agents that can instantiate, validate, and iteratively refine generated research patterns through empirical feedback, including automated experimental design, dataset selection, and preliminary execution. Experimental outcomes can then serve as additional signals to refine the instantiated research stories, forming a feedback loop between method design and empirical validation. Beyond experimentation, future work may further explore how refined research patterns can be systematically translated into complete paper drafts, covering method descriptions, experimental results, and discussion sections. By grounding paper generation in empirically validated research patterns, such a system could move beyond surface-level text generation and provide more faithful, end-to-end support for executable and publishable scientific discovery.\\n\\n\", \"6 Conclusion\": \"\\n\\n6 Conclusion\\n\\nWe presented Idea2Story, a pre-computation\\u2013driven framework for autonomous scientific discovery that shifts literature understanding from runtime reasoning to offline knowledge structuring. By explicitly extracting reusable method units and organizing them into a continuously updated knowledge graph, Idea2Story enables research agents to reason over stable research patterns rather than repeatedly processing raw papers. Our qualitative analyses and comparative studies show that this design leads to research patterns with clearer problem reformulation, stronger methodological structure, and higher conceptual novelty than direct LLM generation. These results highlight the importance of explicit pattern modeling as a foundation for scalable and reliable autonomous research. Looking ahead, integrating Idea2Story with experimental agents to close the loop from abstract research patterns to validated empirical results represents a promising direction toward fully autonomous and trustworthy scientific discovery.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"}, \"bibliography\": {}, \"domain\": \"cs.CE\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"43314448-caba-42dd-a429-7fc7c28e2b4f\", \"authors\": [\"Christopher Willby\", \"Tomohiro Hashizume\", \"Jason Crain\", \"Dieter Jaksch\"], \"title\": \"Symplectic Optimization on Gaussian States\", \"abstract\": \"Computing Gaussian ground states via variational optimization is challenging because the covariance matrices must satisfy the uncertainty principle, rendering constrained or Riemannian optimization costly, delicate, and thus difficult to scale, particularly in large and inhomogeneous systems.

This approach enforces all physical constraints exactly, yielding a globally unconstrained variational formulation of the bosonic ground-state problem. The unconstrained structure also naturally supports solution reuse across nearby Hamiltonians: warm-starting from previously optimized covariance matrices substantially reduces the number of optimization steps required for convergence in families of related configurations, as encountered in crystal lattices, molecular systems, and fluids. We demonstrate the method on weakly dipole-coupled lattices, recovering ground-state energies, covariance matrices, and spectral gaps accurately.

Existing solutions either sacrifice generality (via fine-tuning) or fidelity (via approximation). Moreover, no prior method has introduced a continuous, tunable parameter (like t) that allows smooth interpolation between weak and strong approximations of higher-order logic. Our approach differs by introducing R-GNN[t], a parameterized architecture that uses a transformed atom set At(S) to simulate higher-order interactions through iterative refinement, achieving near-C\u2083 expressivity at low t-values with sub-cubic complexity\u2014thus overcoming both theoretical and practical barriers left unaddressed by previous work.\",\n  \n  \"Question 5\": \"Our approach consists of three key components: (1) a novel input transformation layer that generates At(S), a set of higher-order atoms derived from the original state predicates via a differentiable grammar; (2) a parameterized R-GNN[t] architecture where the parameter t controls the depth of relational abstraction and message passing; and (3) a curriculum-based training strategy using synthetic planning domains (e.g., modified Grid, Logistics, and Sokoban) with increasing relational complexity.

It leverages the team's existing work and elevates it to a level that can earn a significant personal reward.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f **Action Plan for Refining the '5q' Proposal**\n\n**Focus on the following key areas to elevate the proposal:**\n\n1.  **Strengthen the Methodology (Question 5):**\n    *   **Add Specificity:** Instead of just \"a sparse, attention-based triplet processor,\" specify the *type* of attention (e.g., \"a sparse, multi-head attention mechanism with a fixed maximum of 100 active triplets per node\").\n    *   **Clarify the Gating Mechanism:** Define how the \"complexity score\" is calculated. Is it a learned neural network? A simple function of the node's degree and the number of unique relations? This adds rigor.\n    *   **Detail the Integration:** Explain *how* the outputs from the higher-order module are integrated back into the base graph. Is it a simple concatenation? A learned fusion layer? This is crucial for the model's architecture.\n\n2.  **Enhance the Theoretical Analysis (Question 3):**\n    *   **Address the \"Why is it hard?\" Challenge:** The current answer is strong. To make it even better, explicitly state that the **\"non-uniform, context-dependent decisions\"** are hard because the model must learn a *meta-policy* for when to use expensive computation, which is a complex, high-dimensional decision problem that is difficult to train with sparse rewards.\n\n3.  **Improve the Experimental Design (Question 5):**\n    *   **Add a Baseline for Comparison:** Include a **\"Fixed-Parameter R-GNN[t]\"** baseline in the evaluation. This is a direct comparison to the current state-of-the-art and will make the results of ARPN's adaptivity much more compelling.\n    *   **Define the \"Heterogeneous Complexity\" Domain:** Provide a concrete example of a novel domain with heterogeneous complexity (e.g., \"a logistics domain where some tasks require only pairwise relations (e.g., moving a single box) while others require triplet relations (e.g., moving a box through a narrow corridor with two other boxes blocking the path)\").\n\n4.  **Clarify the Expected Outcomes (Question 5):**\n    *   **Quantify the \"Adaptivity Analysis\":** Instead of just \"percentage of states,\" define the metric more precisely. For example, \"the average number of triplet processors activated per state\" or \"the ratio of FLOPs used by the higher-order module to the total FLOPs.\"\n\nBy completing this refinement, Agent 'agent3' will transform a good proposal into an excellent one, directly addressing the team's weaknesses and maximizing their collective and individual success.", "agent4": "Based on the task history, team feedback, and current reward structure, **Agent 'agent4' should prioritize tasks that directly address their core shortcomings: low communication and zero contribution**, while simultaneously advancing a high-impact research idea that aligns with their expertise in planning, logic, and AI generalization.\n\n### \u2705 **Recommended Next Task:**\n> **Lead the formulation of a new, adaptive research proposal (5q) that integrates dynamic complexity control and hybrid symbolic-neural reasoning \u2014 and actively share it with the team to initiate collaboration.**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d **Why This Task Is Optimal for Agent 'agent4':**\n\n1. **Aligns with Role & Expertise**  \n   You are a researcher deeply engaged in *planning, decision-making, and bridging model-free and model-based approaches*.

In these settings, effective tracking of working memory is necessary to infer the agent\\u2019s latent previous state (Zhang et al., 2024).\\n\\n\\nIn this work, we investigate the long-horizon planning abilities of LRMs using a highly simplified variant of the Sokoban puzzle\\u00a0(Culberson, 1998). Rather than increasing spatial complexity, we deliberately minimize the structural complexity of the environment while preserving the long-horizon nature of the task by creating examples with\\nthe lowest possible branching factor compatible with solvability: a single movable block placed within a linear corridor with tightly controlled geometry.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis setting allows us to isolate long-horizon planning from state persistence: models are required to produce complete solution sequences without external memory, intermediate feedback, or state validation, relying solely on internal state representations to track the evolving environment.\\nWe therefore investigate to what extent LRMs can sustain coherent planning over long (but simple) action sequences and whether even minimal reasoning branching in otherwise trivial Sokoban instances is sufficient to induce planning failures.\\n\\n\\nConcretely, we examine whether current LRMs can reliably solve linear-corridor Sokoban puzzles with minimal possible branching and identify the point at which increases in horizon length lead to catastrophic breakdowns in action validity, despite the simplicity of the underlying environment.\\nAs we will show these minimal sub-problems which are trivial to humans (Jaru\\u0161ek and Pel\\u00e1nek, 2010), are still challenging for Large Reasoning Models as shown by other preliminary studies involving spatial intelligence (Cai et al., 2025).\\nWe posit this as a systemic deficiency in long-term action representation and sequential logic, and in spatial reasoning and thus as an important limitation of current LRMs that is not yet fully understood.\\n\\n\", \"2 Related Work\": \"\\n\\n2 Related Work\\n\\n\\n2.1 Benchmarks for LLM Planning\\n\\nAs mentioned above, planning requires LLMs to blend logical, numerical, and spatial reasoning with long-horizon strategic adaptation, rather than just relying on pattern matching or memorization.\\nClassical planning domains expressed in or derived from the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL (Fox and Long, 2003)), such as BlocksWorld (Slaney and Thi\\u00e9baux, 2001), Towers of Hanoi and similar tasks (Pallagani et al., 2023), remain a common benchmark choice, though earlier attempts date back to the pre-ChatGPT era (Silver et al., 2022).\\nTest suites like PlanBench (Valmeekam et al., 2022) introduced structured, domain-agnostic evaluations inspired by classical planning (Ghallab et al., 2016), including plan generation (Oswald et al., 2024; Valmeekam et al., 2025; La Malfa et al., 2025) and optimality (Valmeekam et al., 2022; Zhai and others, 2025; Valmeekam et al., 2023a).\\n\\n\\nIn another line of work, planning is evaluated within agentic or workflow-based frameworks, where LLMs are required to decompose goals into multiple sub-plans (Meyerson et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025; La Malfa et al., 2025).\\nThe results in these settings are encouraging though highly cost intensive.\\nImportantly, when not equipped with external tools or made part of larger workflows (e.g., enabling stateful tracking (Hu et al., 2025b)), innate planning abilities remain still weak (Schepanowski and Ling, 2025).\\nEven the latest foundational models are found to consistently fail in delivering correct sequences of actions (in any format or language) due to two primary deficits: weak internal state representations leading to invalid moves and misleading heuristic search resulting in loops or early termination, as shown in the textual game \\u201c8-puzzle\\u201d in Schepanowski and Ling (2025).\\nMoreover, efficacy of different prompting techniques is model-dependent in a non-predictable way (Schepanowski and Ling, 2025; Deng et al., 2025).\\n\\n\\nOther works have systematically investigated the performances of LLMs in playing textual games with gym-style APIs (Brockman et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2025a).\\nBeyond structured puzzles, community-driven and informal game-oriented benchmarks like word-game bench (Stojanovski, 2024) and nonogram logic puzzles (Berend et al., 2014; Kleine, 2026) with multi-difficulty instances have been devised to measure how well models plan under both explicit and implicit constraints, track environment states, and adapt over multiple turns.\\nThe varying depth of planning ability required helps to reveal how performance scales with complexity and structure.\\n\\n\\nIn general, existing benchmarks using specific planning languages and/or internal reasoning traces expressed in natural language show that LLMs exhibit limited planning abilities in various domains (Kambhampati et al., 2024), especially as the complexity and horizon length of the problems increase.\\nThis gap motivates the development of new benchmarks tailored to planning and solving structured textual puzzles with LLMs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2.2 Sokoban as a Benchmark for Planning\\n\\nThe Sokoban puzzle involves spatial planning in a highly constrained environment. Solvable Sokoban maps can be generated efficiently (Murase et al., 1996), and the environment is fully controllable and deterministic. These properties enable rigorous evaluation using exact solvers and verifiers, as well as metrics such as search depth and solution time (Jaru\\u0161ek and Pel\\u00e1nek, 2010; Shoham and Schaeffer, 2020).\\nUnlike puzzles such as the Tower of Hanoi, which can be solved by repeating a simple pattern for larger instances, Sokoban offers no shortcuts.\\nEach map is unique, and moving a single box can block or open paths in ways that prevent a one-size-fits-all solution.\\nAs a result, Sokoban is considered a good benchmark for evaluating planning abilities in the 2023 edition of the International Planning Competition\\u00a0(Taitler et al., 2024).\\n\\n\\nRecently, recurrent neural networks (non LLM-based) trained over multiple examples of Sokoban puzzles have obtained state of the art performance (Jolicoeur-Martineau, 2025; Taufeeque et al., 2024).\\nHowever, LLMs are found to perform poorly, struggling even with simple maps and correctly solving only a small fraction of instances: Valmeekam et al. (2025) report success rates of just about 10\\u201312% when using the OpenAI o1-preview model directly.\\nIn contrast, substantially higher success rates are achieved in an LLM-Modulo setting, where the same model is used to generate plans that are then executed by an external planner, yielding approximately 43% solved instances for o1-preview (and about 10% for o1-mini), albeit at significantly higher computational cost.\\n\\n\\nMost prior work on textual puzzle solving and planning with LLMs has emphasized high-level notions such as search depth, branching factor, or overall puzzle complexity.\\nMuch less attention has been paid to the role of simpler, low-level operations that these tasks implicitly rely on.\\nEvidence from seemingly trivial problems suggests that LLM failures do not always stem from complexity itself, but from how basic reasoning steps are elicited.\\nA well-known example is the character-counting question \\u201chow many r\\u2019s are in strawberry?\\u201d (Karpathy, 2024), which has sparked debate over whether LLM errors are caused by tokenization or deeper representational limits\\u00a0(Shin and Kaneko, 2024).\\nThe work by Xu and Ma (2025) revisits this issue through a careful empirical study, showing that LLMs are in fact capable of performing these simple symbolic operations, but often fail unless prompted to reason explicitly.\\nCharacter-level benchmarks, such as CharBench (Uzan and Pinter, 2025), shows that modern LLMs struggle with simple character counting and positioning tasks not because tokenization fully explains these errors, but because intrinsic properties like word length and actual character count have a stronger influence on performance, indicating that basic symbolic operations are not reliably deployed unless the model is guided to engage them explicitly.\\n\\n\\nPut together, these observations point to a broader interpretation of failures in spatial planning and puzzle games, suggesting that they may arise from missing or weak activation of basic operations, rather than from the inherent difficulty of the planning problem.\\n\\n\\n\", \"3 Methods\": \"\\n\\n3 Methods\\n\\n\\n3.1 Sokoban game\\n\\nFigure\\u00a01 shows an example of a Sokoban puzzle and the game\\u2019s central mechanic: the player controls a sprite that pushes boxes within a two-dimensional spatially constrained environment with the goal to position them onto predefined locations.\\nDespite its apparent simplicity, Sokoban is a NP-hard and PSPACE-complete problem (Culberson, 1998), positioning it as a canonical domain for symbolic and hierarchical planning.\\nApart from the pictorial representation, Sokoban maps can be encoded using an ASCII-based symbolic representation as expressed in Table\\u00a01.\\nSequences of main character actions are typically encoded in LURD format (left,up,right,down), with lowercase letters indicating simple moves, and uppercase letters indicating box pushes.\\nAlthough moves and pushes have distinct notations in classical Sokoban planning, in our experiments we restrict only to comma-separated uppercase letters.\\nThis representation does not compromise the information content of the solutions and simplifies the output format for language models, avoiding potential mistakes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 1: Example of a Sokoban puzzle.

The maps share the same initial configuration in which the goal is positioned at one end of the map, the player at the opposite end, and the box placed in between the two, so that all elements lie along the same row or column.\\nThis choice is motivated by its simplicity: the corridor length \\u2113\\\\ell is the only map parameter and it serves as a proxy for map difficulty.\\nHence, with just one degree of freedom to account for, we overcome the problem of defining complex measures for solution difficulty: the longer the map, the harder the task.\\n\\n\\nIn our benchmark, we consider map lengths \\u2113\\\\ell ranging from 5 to 100 in increments of 5. For each map, we generate four augmented variants corresponding to rotations of 90\\u221890^{\\\\circ}, 180\\u2218180^{\\\\circ}, and 270\\u2218270^{\\\\circ}, as well as the original (unrotated) orientation.\\nThis augmentation strategy reduces the risk of querying the model with data that may have been encountered during pretraining and enables analysis of whether models exhibit orientation-dependent performance.\\nIn total, the evaluation set comprises 80 distinct maps, spanning 20 values of \\u2113\\\\ell with four orientations each.\\nWe publicly release our dataset at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Linello/sokobanlevels.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3 Experimental Setup\\n\\nWe employ both open and closed weights model, specifically DeepSeek R1 (Guo et al., 2025), GPT-5 and GPT-oss 120B\\u00a0(OpenAI, 2026; 2025).\\nThey are all reasoning models, i.e., they are configured to generate an explicit reasoning trace prior to emitting the final answer to the user query.\\nFor GPT models, we don\\u2019t change the default temperature neither the default reasoning effort (set to medium).\\nInstead we cap the maximum number of completion tokens (including both reasoning and final answer tokens) at 32,76832{,}768.\\nAll inference calls are routed through OpenRouter,111https://openrouter.ai/ with the inference provider consistently set to DeepInfra.222https://deepinfra.com/\\nIn light of both computational and financial resource constraints, we limit our empirical analysis to these two primary model families.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3.1 1-shot Inference\\n\\nIn the first experimental setup, we test the ability of the selected LRMs to solve simple Sokoban puzzles when provided only with the instructions, the mapping of characters as in Table\\u00a01 and a single demonstration.\\nUnder this setup, thus, models are by design limited to use exclusively their internal state representations to solve Sokoban puzzles of varying solution lengths.\\nThe prompts used for all models are described in Appendix A.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3.2 LLM-Modulo\\n\\nIn the second experimental setup, we investigated how Sokoban puzzle\\u2013solving performance can be enhanced when LRMs are provided with access to external planning solvers, within an LLM-modulo framework analogous to that of Valmeekam et al. (2023a).\\nTo this end, we prompted the models to generate specific instances of planning problems while providing them with a pre-existing, human-authored and verified PDDL domain (Appendix B.2).\\nIn this setup, the model is responsible solely for formulating the PDDL problem, which is then processed through an agentic pipeline.\\nThis workflow utilizes a domain parser to instantiate the formal world representation and a dedicated problem parser that acts as a validator, informing the model whether the generated problem is syntactically and semantically well-formed.\\nFinally, the pipeline provides access to specialized PDDL planners such as Fast-Downward or PyperPlan, integrated via the Unified Planning library (Micheli et al., 2025; Alkhazraji et al., 2020; Helmert, 2006) to solve the problem and get the optimal plan.\\nAll the tools were wrapped and made accessible to the LRMs via a custom Model Context Protocol library (Anthropic, 2024) implemented with FastMCP library (Lowin, 2024).\\nThe design of our architecture is shown in Figure\\u00a02.\\n\\n\\nThe planner tool produces a variety of diagnostic and informational messages that are provided back to the model, including error reports, timing information, and the complete raw response.\\nThis raw response can be further processed to extract the LURD solution in cases where the problem is successfully solved.\\nIn failure scenarios, the tool returns the encountered errors in natural language to the LRM.\\nErrors or warnings are generated in situations such as logically inconsistent or unsatisfiable problems, invalid or inappropriate initial conditions, or when the solver exceeds the maximum allotted execution time (60 seconds).\\nThe agentic loop ends either with a valid plan or with a message to the final user explaining that, after three failed attempts (which may include having the LRM reformulate the PDDL problem), the agent could not find a satisfactory solution.\\n\\n\\nThe LRM-modulo pipeline is considerably slower than the reasoning-only one.\\nIt took an average of 75 minutes using GPT-5-mini on an AWS t3.xlarge instance (4 CPUs at 3.1 GHz, 16 GB RAM) to collect the points shown in Figure\\u00a06(a).\\nThe prompts being used for the experiments are described in Appendix\\u00a0B.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: Panel (a) represents a simple schema of our LLM-modulo pipeline. The detailed input prompts are collected in Appendix\\u00a0B.1, while an example of output is shown in Panel (b).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4 Evaluation\\n\\nA solution to a Sokoban instance is defined as a sequence of actions that transforms the system from its initial configuration to the final state, where all boxes are correctly placed on goal positions.\\nMultiple valid solutions may exist for the same map, however we restrict the evaluation only to optimal solutions, i.e., sequences that achieve the goal with the minimum possible number of moves. The intrinsic simplicity of our setting makes optimality the natural criterion.\\nClearly, the one-dimensional layout of the map allows only for a unique optimal solution.\\n\\n\\nAccuracy:\\n\\nGiven a map of length \\u2113\\\\ell, we define the accuracy in Eq.\\u00a01 as the expectation, over all repetitions and rotations NN of the indicator of exact string equality (via Iverson brackets) between the predicted action sequence \\ud835\\udc31^(\\u2113)\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}^{(\\\\ell)} and the ground-truth sequence \\ud835\\udc31(\\u2113)\\\\mathbf{x}^{(\\\\ell)}, i.e., the fraction of trials in which the two character strings are identical:\\n\\n\\n\\nAccuracy\\u200b(\\u2113)=1N\\u200b\\u2211n=1N[\\ud835\\udc31^(\\u2113)=\\ud835\\udc31(\\u2113)].\\\\rm{Accuracy}(\\\\ell)=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{n=1}^{N}[\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}^{(\\\\ell)}=\\\\mathbf{x}^{(\\\\ell)}].\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n\\nHere NN is the product of the total number of trials ntn_{t} and the number of map rotations nr=4n_{r}=4.\\nIncreasing ntn_{t} mitigates the intrinsic non-determinism of the obtained solutions, by sampling at multiple seeds.\\nIn the LRM experiments, we set the number of repetitions ntn_{t} to 8.\\nConversely, in the LRM-modulo experiments, the substantially higher computational and monetary costs imposed stricter constraints.\\nWe therefore reduced the number of repetitions ntn_{t} to 4.\\n\\n\\n\\nPrefix accuracy:\\n\\nAlongside the standard accuracy metric, we define Prefix Accuracy (Eq.\\u00a02) to provide a more granular evaluation of model performance.\\nThis metric calculates the average proportion of correct symbols generated by comparing the predicted and true plans\\u2019 strings element-wise:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrefixAccuracy\\u200b(\\u2113)=1N\\u200b\\u2211n=1N[m(n)\\u2264\\u2113]\\u2113\\u200b\\u2211i=1m(n)[x^i(n)=xi(n)],\\\\text{PrefixAccuracy}(\\\\ell)=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{n=1}^{N}\\\\frac{[m^{(n)}\\\\leq\\\\ell]}{\\\\ell}\\\\sum_{i=1}^{m^{(n)}}[\\\\hat{x}_{i}^{(n)}=x_{i}^{(n)}],\\n\\n(2)\\n\\n\\nwhere m(n)m^{(n)} is the length of the predicted plan \\ud835\\udc31^(n)\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}^{(n)}.\\nUnlike the hard matching of the standard accuracy metric, prefix-accuracy is more optimistic, rewarding the model for correct partial trajectories even if it stops prematurely.\\nHowever, it remains strictly penalized for overshooting: if the predicted length m(n)m^{(n)} exceeds the ground-truth length \\u2113\\\\ell, the score for that trial is 0.\\nFor instance, a prediction \\ud835\\udc31^(n)=(l, l, l)\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}^{(n)}=(\\\\texttt{l, l, l}) against a ground truth \\ud835\\udc31(n)=(l, l, l, l)\\\\mathbf{x}^{(n)}=(\\\\texttt{l, l, l, l}) yields a score of 3/43/4, whereas any prediction exceeding length 4 results in a score of 0.\\n\\n\\n\\nManhattan Distance:\\n\\nWhile string-based metrics evaluate the symbolic fidelity of the action sequence, they do not account for the spatial proximity of the agent to the objective.\\nWe therefore use the Manhattan Distance (Eq.\\u00a03) to measure the L1L_{1} distance between the agent\\u2019s terminal position and the goal, independent of sequence semantics or environmental obstacles.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nD\\u200b(\\u2113)=1N\\u200b\\u2211n=1N(|xfinal(n)\\u2212xgoal(n)|+|yfinal(n)\\u2212ygoal(n)|)D(\\\\ell)=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{n=1}^{N}\\\\left(|x^{(n)}_{\\\\text{final}}-x^{(n)}_{\\\\text{goal}}|+|y^{(n)}_{\\\\text{final}}-y^{(n)}_{\\\\text{goal}}|\\\\right)\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere, (xfinal(n),yfinal(n))(x^{(n)}_{\\\\text{final}},y^{(n)}_{\\\\text{final}}) represents the agent\\u2019s coordinates after executing all moves in the predicted sequence \\ud835\\udc31^(n)\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}^{(n)}, starting from the origin (0,0)(0,0). The goal coordinates (xgoal(n),ygoal(n))(x^{(n)}_{\\\\text{goal}},y^{(n)}_{\\\\text{goal}}) are always at a fixed distance \\u2113\\\\ell from the origin, specifically (\\u00b1\\u2113,0)(\\\\pm\\\\ell,0) for 0\\u2218/180\\u22180^{\\\\circ}/180^{\\\\circ} rotations and (0,\\u00b1\\u2113)(0,\\\\pm\\\\ell) for 90\\u2218/270\\u221890^{\\\\circ}/270^{\\\\circ} rotations.\\n\\n\\nThe primary motivation for this metric is to distinguish between \\u201cnear-misses\\u201d and total navigational failures.\\nBy measuring spatial displacement, we can quantify whether a model that failed the exact string match nonetheless moved in the correct direction or reached the vicinity of the goal.\\nThis provides a soft failure signal that string-based metrics like Accuracy or Prefix Accuracy cannot capture.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"4 Results\": \"\\n\\n4 Results\\n\\n\\n4.1 1-shot Inference\\n\\nFigure\\u00a03 summarizes the results in terms of accuracy and total token usage.\\nThe plot on the left of Figure\\u00a03 shows the accuracy as a function of the corridor length, \\u2113\\\\ell, for all tested models.\\nSimilarly to Shojaee et al. (2025), our results show approximately three regions in which the models behave according to different regimes: an easier region where corridor lengths are short, characterized by higher accuracy; an intermediate region characterized by a rapid decrease in accuracy as the length of the corridors increases and a harder region in which the models completely fail to return a correct plan.\\nThese regions are specific to each model.\\n\\n\\nCrucially, corridors are deep but narrow problems: many sequential steps (depth d\\u223c\\u2113d\\\\sim\\\\ell) with minimal branching.\\nIn such settings, a small per-step probability pwp_{w} of miscounting the size of the map compounds exponentially, yielding success probability \\u223c(1\\u2212pw)\\u2113\\\\sim(1-p_{w})^{\\\\ell}.\\nThis may explain the three-region performance curve we observe: short corridors tolerate occasional drift, producing a plateau of acceptable accuracy; intermediate lengths mark the onset of exponential decay, while long corridors see near-total collapse as cumulative errors dominate.\\nWe thus believe that the main reason LRMs cannot correctly plan in longer corridors is mainly due to internal counting representation.\\nIt was indeed shown in McCoy et al. (2024) that when asked to count individual characters, LLMs perform better with common characters than uncommon ones (like #).\\nThis counting failure can be interpreted through the lens of Lu et al. (2025) \\u201cwandering vs systematic exploration\\u201d framework: maintaining an accurate count over many positions is equivalent to maintaining correct state representations across a chain of transitions.\\n\\n\\nAs an observation, we report that GPT-5-mini displays an anomalous accuracy peak around \\u2113=50\\\\ell=50 which is however hardly explained by the model above.\\nWe believe this effect is likely due to memorization, but without access to internal states models this remains an hypothesis.\\n\\n\\nFigure\\u00a03 shows the number of output tokens as a function of the corridor length, \\u2113\\\\ell, filtering only for correctly solved Sokoban problems.\\nLinear regression analysis reveals that for each model, the number of output tokens for correctly predicted problems increases with the length of the corridor.\\nWe don\\u2019t observe the counterintuitive scaling mentioned by Shojaee et al. (2025) with models declining the request to do very long reasoning to solve complex problems.\\nInstead, we report the reasoning effort increasing almost linearly with problem complexity, with none of the three models declining our request early.\\n\\n\\nFigure 3: Accuracy and number of reasoning tokens for LRM experiment. Left: average accuracy. Error bars are computed as the 5th and 95th percentile of responses. Right: scaling behaviour of reasoning length against corridor length filtered for correct solutions only.\\n\\n\\nIn the linear regression analysis above, however only a small fraction of the variance is explained due to the noise of the measurements.\\nThis trend is observed only in the region where \\u2113<50\\\\ell<50, since for larger corridor\\u2019s lengths the number of correct predictions decreases significantly for all tested models.\\nMain parameters of the linear regression fit are collected in Table\\u00a02.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nModel\\nSlope\\n\\ud835\\udc11\\ud835\\udfd0\\\\mathbf{R^{2}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeepSeek R1\\n51.151.1\\n0.350.35\\n\\n\\nGPT-5-mini\\n29.829.8\\n0.620.62\\n\\n\\nGPT-oss 120B\\n39.439.4\\n0.400.40\\n\\n\\n\\nCorrect Answers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nModel\\nSlope\\n\\ud835\\udc11\\ud835\\udfd0\\\\mathbf{R^{2}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeepSeek R1\\n86.3\\n0.25\\n\\n\\nGPT-5-mini\\n55.2\\n0.14\\n\\n\\nGPT-oss 120B\\n85.9\\n0.12\\n\\n\\n\\nWrong Answers\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 2: Fit parameters associated to the linear regressions performed on Figure\\u00a04 (see below).\\n\\n\\nIn Figure\\u00a04 we further analyze the number of emitted tokens as a function of the corridor length parameter \\u2113\\\\ell, considering both correct and incorrect answers.\\nUnlike Shojaee et al. (2025) which observed a counterintuitive reduction in the reasoning effort for problems above a certain threshold of difficulty, we observe a steady increase in the number of output tokens.\\nWhat we found shows that the difficulty of a problem is not characterized by the decrease in the reasoning effort, but instead by the substantially higher variability in token counts of incorrect answers compared to correct ones.\\nThis suggests that when the model diverges from the correct reasoning trajectory, it can fail in multiple ways, whereas successful completions remain more concise and consistent, likely an effect of inductive bias of Group Reinforcement Policy Optimization (GRPO) post-training, where concise reasoning traces are preferred to lengthy ones (Sui et al., 2025).\\nTo quantify this effect, we fit a robust regression of completion tokens against corridor\\u2019s length for each model.\\nBoth slope and intercept appear model-specific: more efficient models, such as GPT-5-mini, show lower slopes and reduced variability across both correct and incorrect responses.\\nAnother relevant distinction can be made, highlighting differences in models\\u2019 calibration.\\nDeepSeek-R1 and GPT-5-mini display similar slopes and intercepts between correct and incorrect predictions, GPT-oss-120B instead reflect large differences in the regression parameters.\\nA recurrent behavior is that for longer corridors, LRMs often reach the maximum allowed number of output tokens.\\nAfter a qualitative inspection of the reasoning traces, we observed that the main reason this happens is that the models get stuck in repeating the same action or reasoning frame over and over until they reach the token limit.\\nWe report the reasoning traces for the interested user at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/sokoban_traces/\\n\\n\\nThis repetitive looping behavior exemplifies what Lu et al. (Lu et al., 2025) classify as unnecessary exploration and failure to maintain a visited-state set. In a systematic search, an agent would track which configurations (or reasoning states) have already been explored and avoid revisiting them. The token-limit exhaustion we observe suggests that LRMs lack such memory: they repeatedly propose the same moves or reasoning steps without recognizing the cycle.\\nThis is evidence of wandering rather than systematic planning: the model explores aimlessly rather than pruning redundant paths.\\nIn a corridor setting, where the state space is essentially linear, even a simple mental tape of visited positions would suffice to prevent loops; the inability to maintain it indicates a fundamental deficit in structured state tracking.\\n\\n\\nFigure 4: Number of completion tokens produced by each model as a function of corridor length. Separate linear regressions are fitted for correct and incorrect responses, with outliers excluded. A small jitter is added to the x-axis to improve visualization.\\n\\n\\nIn Figure\\u00a05 we analyze our data from the point of view of prefix accuracy and Manhattan distance.\\nThe metrics show a decreasing trend for all models that is similar to that represented in Figure\\u00a03.\\nSome patterns, like the peak at \\u2113=50\\\\ell=50 for GPT-5-mini and the increase in accuracy around the central region for DeepSeek R1, are further accentuated.\\nThis highlights that the main source of errors in most Sokoban problems is related to counting mistakes.\\nIn terms of Manhattan distance, the optimal solution would have distance one as the player and the goal are separated by the box.\\nHowever, as observed sometimes the player is positioned exactly on the goal, thus ignoring the spatial constraints of the problem.\\n\\n\\nThese violations, where the predicted sequence places the player on the goal position despite walls and box, are instances of what Lu et al. (2025) terms invalid exploration.\\nIn a valid state-transition graph, certain moves (e.g., walking through walls, teleporting over boxes) are inadmissible.\\nWhen a model proposes such transitions, it demonstrates that its internal representation does not faithfully track the game\\u2019s physics and its constraints.\\nLLMs hallucinate states unreachable under the true transition rules, producing reasoning traces that are syntactically plausible but structurally incoherent for the problem.\\nThe fact that even advanced reasoning models exhibit these errors underscores a core limitation: without explicit state-transition verification, test-time scaling cannot guarantee adherence to problem constraints and rules.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 5: Other useful metrics represented as functions of the corridor\\u2019s length.

here we outline the main constraints and threats to validity.\\nWe focus on one-box linear corridors, which test long-horizon counting and state maintenance rather than the full difficulty of multi-box Sokoban with deadlocks.\\nThus, the benchmark provides only a lower bound on planning ability.\\nFor evaluation, we use exact-plan validation against a reference generator.\\nAlthough this is stricter than necessary in general Sokoban, where multiple optimal plans may exist, it is suitable for corridors; future work will instead use solver-based verification to handle maps with multiple valid solutions.\\nWe also find sensitivity to prompt formatting, especially orientation-related effects such as the many newlines in vertical maps.\\nAlternative encodings, such as row/column numbered grids or other textual cues, may reduce this issue.\\nAnother variability source is model metadata and provider backends: although all calls go through one routing layer, backend implementations and model revisions can change over time.\\nWe log identifiers and dates, but some instability is inherent in API-based evaluations.\\nPretraining contamination is another concern; corridor rotations lower the chance that specific plans were memorized but do not eliminate it.\\nFinally, corridor tasks have limited external validity, since success or failure may not transfer to richer planning domains.\\nWe treat these settings mainly as a sanity check, with follow-up experiments planned to add obstacles, branching structures, and deadlocks.\\n\\n\\n\", \"Societal Impact\": \"\\nSocietal Impact\\n\\nThis paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of Machine Learning through clearer diagnostics of long-horizon planning.\\nWhile any benchmark could have indirect downstream effects by steering research agendas, we do not identify specific societal risks unique to this work beyond standard concerns about evaluation misuse.\\nWe therefore do not highlight any particular societal impacts at this time.\\n\\n\", \"Appendix A Prompts for 1-shot Inference Settings\": \"\\n\\nAppendix A Prompts for 1-shot Inference Settings\\n\\nIn this section we report the detailed prompts that we have used throughout our experiments with reasoning models alone.\\nPrompts are direct, no Chain of Thought elicited as it is known that it may hamper internal reasoning on LRMs.\\nA simple solved problem is provided as the 1-shot example.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSystem Prompt\\n\\n\\n\\u2b07\\nYou are an assistant that helps in solving assigned Sokoban games.\\n\\nYour task is to examine the provided Sokoban problem and find a solution.\\n\\nAll provided Sokoban problems are assigned in form of ASCII maps.\\n\\nThe mapping is the following:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2018\\u2018\\u2018\\n\\n @ - Player\\n\\n + - Player on Goal\\n\\n $ - Box\\n\\n * - Box on Goal\\n\\n . - Goal (Empty)\\n\\n # - Wall Brick\\n\\n\\u2018\\u2018\\u2018\\n\\n\\n\\nThe game is solved when the box is pushed into the goal position, hence when the position of \\u2018$\\u2018 coincides with the position of \\u2018.\\u2018.\\n\\nThe player can move in all the empty spaces of the ASCII map while respecting the walls.\\n\\nWhen the player is adjacent to a box, the player can push the box into an adjacent empty space.\\n\\nAfter pushing a box, the new position of the agent will be the position of the box before the push.\\n\\nThe player cannot pull the box, only push it.\\n\\nThe actions you can perform in the game are:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2018\\u2018\\u2018\\n\\n L - Move Left\\n\\n R - Move Right\\n\\n U - Move Up\\n\\n D - Move Down\\n\\n\\u2018\\u2018\\u2018\\n\\n\\n\\nAll provided problems CAN be solved.\\n\\nYou must give your solution in form of a sequence of allowed actions, separated by commas.\\n\\nYou must give only the sequence of actions, without any additional text or explanation.\\n\\nYou must enclose your solution inside the tags <plan> </plan>.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following is an example of a Sokoban problem and its solution:\\n\\n\\n\\nProblem:\\n\\n\\n\\n#####\\n\\n#@ ##\\n\\n## $ ##\\n\\n # #\\n\\n ##. ##\\n\\n ## #\\n\\n ###\\n\\n\\n\\nSolution:\\n\\n\\n\\n<plan>\\n\\nR,R,D,D\\n\\n</plan>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUser Prompt\\n\\n\\n\\u2b07\\nHere is the Sokoban problem to solve, enclosed in triple backtics:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2018\\u2018\\u2018\\n\\n{{ sokoban_map }}\\n\\n\\u2018\\u2018\\u2018\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"Appendix B Prompts for LLM-Modulo Settings\": \"\\n\\nAppendix B Prompts for LLM-Modulo Settings\\n\\nIn this section, we show the system prompt we used for the experiments on LLM-Modulo settings.\\nThe user prompt remains the same as shown in Appendix\\u00a0A.

Our system utilizes two key innovations: Sequential Research Plan Refinement via Reflection and a Candidates Crossover algorithm. The sequential refinement process is demonstrated as an efficient method that allows the agent to maintain a centralized Global Research Context, enabling it to look back at current progress, reason about the research plan, and intelligently make changes at runtime. This dynamic adaptation contrasts with parallel approaches, which often suffer from siloed knowledge. The Candidates Crossover algorithm further enhances search efficiency by deploying multiple LLM candidates with varied parameters to explore a larger search space, with their findings synthesized to curate a comprehensive final research response. The process concludes with One Shot Report Generation, ensuring the final document is informed by a unified narrative and high fact density. Powered by the Gemini 2.5 Pro model, our Deep Researcher was evaluated on the DeepResearch Bench, a globally recognized benchmark of 100 doctoral level research tasks. Our architecture achieved an overall score of 46.21, demonstrating superior performance by surpassing leading deep research agents such as Claude Researcher, Nvidia AIQ Research Assistant, Perplexity Research, Kimi Researcher and Grok Deeper Search present on the DeepResearch Bench actively running leaderboard. This performance marginally exceeds our previous work, Static DRA, and reinforces the finding that sequential scaling consistently outperforms the parallel self consistency paradigm.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20843v1\", \"timestamp\": 1769625939, \"sections\": {\"1 Introduction\": \"\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nWe demonstrate a Deep Researcher architecture which utilizes Research Plan Reflection to perform continuous plan refinement (if required) and Candidates Crossover allowing for the sampling of multiple answers using varied candidate\\u2019s model parameters (e.g., temperature, top_k) to explore a larger search space. At any particular instance of time the deep researcher stores the context of the previous research done and revisits them to decide upon:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nThe next (potentially un-explored) area to be researched.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nRefining the Research Plan if needed.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\n\\nDetermining the percentage Research Progress.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe continue the research process until we have hit a satisfactory threshold of research progress or we have exhausted the maximum retries. The Deep Researcher has an LLM-as-a-judge which analyzes the research performed and decides on the percentage of the research progress. If the researcher crosses the threshold of 90% progress, the research process is halted and a research report is generated.\\n\\n\\nWe generate a research report in a single-shot by an LLM Agent acting as a report writer. The Report Writer Agent has access to the entire research context on the topic and utilises it to generate a Research Report in a single shot. Unlike Google\\u2019s TTD-DR (Test-Time Diffusion) [4] which performs Report-level Denoising inspired by the sampling process in Diffusion models to where they continuously refine the noisy generated initial report iteratively.\\n\\n\", \"2 Sequential Refinement approach vs Parallel Scaling\": \"\\n\\n2 Sequential Refinement approach vs Parallel Scaling\\n\\nThe development of Deep Research Agents (DRAs) has seen the emergence of two primary paradigms for handling complex, multi-faceted research tasks: Parallel Scaling and Sequential Refinement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nParallel Scaling - Efficiency and Its Limitations: Parallel scaling, as implemented in architectures like GPT Researcher [2] and our previous work, Static-DRA [6], focuses on decomposing a research topic into multiple independent sub-topics. These sub-topics are then investigated concurrently by parallel execution agents. While this approach offers significant advantages in terms of reduced latency and stable performance through horizontal scaling, it often suffers from a \\u201dsiloed knowledge\\u201d problem. Because each agent operates within the vacuum of its specific sub-task, the system lacks a holistic \\u201dGlobal Context\\u201d. This isolation makes it difficult for the model to recognize overlapping information, avoid redundant search queries, or make intelligent, real-time modifications to the research plan based on discoveries made in other branches.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nSequential Refinement - Global Context and Dynamic Adaptation: In contrast, the Sequential Refinement approach leverages the iterative nature of the research process. Google\\u2019s TTD-DR (Test-Time Diffusion) [4] architecture exemplifies this by performing \\u201dReport-level Denoising,\\u201d where an initial draft is continuously refined through sequential iterations inspired by diffusion models. Our Deep Researcher advances this paradigm by shifting the focus from report refinement to Sequential Research Plan Refinement. In this model, the agent maintains a centralized Global Research Context - a comprehensive memory of every search trajectory and artifact gathered. By building each research chain explicitly upon previous attempts, the agent can \\u201dlook back\\u201d at its progress and reason about which areas remain unexplored. This allows for dynamic plan refinement, enabling the agent to pivot its strategy at runtime, add unforeseen sub-topics, or terminate redundant paths.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe superiority of sequential scaling is supported by recent findings in \\u201dThe Sequential Edge\\u201d (Chopra 2025) [7] paper, which demonstrates that sequential scaling consistently outperforms the parallel self-consistency paradigm in 95.6% of configurations, with accuracy gains of up to 46.7%. This is attributed to the model\\u2019s ability to reason with a fuller, more integrated context rather than disparate fragments.\\n\\n\\nBy adopting this sequential approach, our Deep Researcher achieved a score of 46.21 on the DeepResearch Bench [1], outperforming leading deep research agents such as Claude Researcher [8], Perplexity Research [13], Grok Deeper Search [17] and many others in the leaderboard [10]. Our architecture ensures that the final One-Shot Report Generation is informed by a unified narrative and high fact density, producing the depth required for PhD-level research.\\n\\n\", \"3 Deep Researcher Design\": \"\\n\\n3 Deep Researcher Design\\n\\n\\n3.1 High Level Design\\n\\nThe high level design of the Deep Researcher includes multiple modules working together to carry out the deep research on a given topic. The design is demonstrated in Figure 2.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: Deep Researcher - High Level Design\\n\\n\\nThe research methodology is structured as a series of sequential iterations, wherein each successive phase leverages findings from previous cycles to facilitate informed decision-making regarding targeted research areas and necessary plan refinements. The summary of the research process is demonstrated in the steps mentioned below.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nStep 1 - Research Plan Curation: The research topic is provided to the Planning agent that curates a research plan for the provided topic. The plan comprises detailed steps to take in order to carry out the research.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nStep 2 - Generate Search Query: The curated plan is read by the Search agent that generates a search query. The agent also reads the global context to understand what all has been already researched and intelligently curates a search query.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\n\\nStep 3 - Answer Search Query: The search query from the previous step is answered by the Search Agent. At this step the agent utilises a Web Search tool to gather recent events and updates regarding the query. The agent also incorporates the Candidate Crossover algorithm to improve the answer generated for the query. The search query and the answer is then added to the global context.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.\\n\\nStep 4 - Research Plan Reflection: The Planning agent reads the current research plan and the global context to decide whether to update the currently followed research plan or not. The agent also decides on what changes to make in the plan if at all needed.\\n\\n\\n\\n5.\\n\\nStep 5 - Research Plan Update (maybe): The Planning agent takes on the plan reflection input from the previous step and makes the necessary updates in the Research Plan if suggested in the previous step. If there\\u2019s no change needed, the existing plan is followed.\\n\\n\\n\\n6.\\n\\nStep 6 - Analyze Research Progress: The Planning agent reads the research plan and the global context to analyze the current state of the research progress. If the research progress has crossed the 90% threshold benchmark, then the research process is ended. Otherwise the research loop is continued again from Step 2.\\n\\n\\n\\n7.\\n\\nStep 7 - One Shot Report generation: Once the research loop ends, we perform one-shot report generation by an LLM agent acting as a report writer. The agent is provided with the current research plan and the global context to write the research report in one go.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe subsequent sections provide a comprehensive and detailed examination of the aforementioned procedural stages.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2 Candidate Crossover algorithm\\n\\nWe implement a Candidate Crossover algorithm that is integrated into Step 3, the phase in which the Search Agent conducts research for a specified query. This algorithm enhances the agent\\u2019s efficiency by deploying multiple candidates to investigate the same query in parallel. Upon completion of their respective investigations, the findings are synthesized through a crossover process to generate a comprehensive and finalized research response. The algorithm is demonstrated in Figure 3.\\n\\n\\nFigure 3: Deep Researcher - Candidate Crossover algorithm\\n\\n\\nOur Candidate Crossover algorithm is inspired by the Self-Evolution algorithm introduced in Google\\u2019s Deep Researcher with Test Time Diffusion (TTD-DR) [4] paper. Each candidate is a unit LLM agent with varied configuration settings. To facilitate the exploration of a large search space during inference, we initialize n candidates (in this paper all research topics were evaluated on n=3 candidates), each with access to a unit LLM Agent having n different configurations of temperature and top_k parameters respectively. By providing each Candidate with varied parameters, we allow each of them to attend to a different space at inference time. These candidates are provided with a search query and additional artifacts obtained from the Web Search tool, and are tasked to generate concise answers retaining all facts and numbers. We use Tavily [14] for web search and aim to receive top 5 search results for a topic from the web. We also make sure to have only relevant web search results with us for writing a report for the research topic. The Tavily Web Search tool [15] provides a score field for every search result returned which defines \\u201cthe relevance score of the search result\\u201d. We have a threshold score value set to 30% which filters out any search result whose score is less than the threshold score.\\n\\n\\nLater during the Cross-over, we combine the information by merging the answers of all the candidates, consolidating the best information from their respective evolutionary paths to curate a final research response and produce superior context for the main report generation process.\\n\\n\\nTTD-DR\\u2019s Self Evolution algorithm can be summarized in the following steps:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nStep 1 - Initial States: LLM Agent units generate diverse output variants (e.g., search query answers) by sampling with varied parameters like temperature and top_k to broaden the search space.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nStep 2 - Environmental Feedback: An LLM-as-a-judge uses auto-raters to evaluate variants on metrics like Helpfulness and provides textual critiques for improvement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nStep 3 - Revision Step: Variants are iteratively revised based on scores and feedback until stopping criteria are met.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nStep 4 - Cross-over: Multiple revised variants are merged into a single high-quality output, consolidating the best information for the final report.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe did not include the Environmental Feedback (Step 2) and the Revision Steps (Step 3) present in the algorithm to reduce the latency of the Report Generation process and inference time complexity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3 Agent\\u2019s Memory: Global Research Context\\n\\nThe Global Research Context serves as the centralized memory repository for the Deep Researcher, enabling a more cohesive sequential refinement model. This module stores the comprehensive history of the research process, including:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nSearch Trajectories: Maintains a detailed log of every search query generated by the Search agent and the corresponding answers produced by the Search Agent with Candidate Crossover algorithm.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nContextual Artifacts: Houses raw data, facts, and numbers gathered from Web Search tools, ensuring that the final report writer has access to the primary evidence discovered during the loop.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nBy maintaining this global state, the system provides the model with the \\u201dglobal context\\u201d necessary to reason across previously explored areas. This prevents the Search agent from drafting redundant search queries and allows the Planning agent to intelligently determine the percentage of research progress based on the totality of information gathered. The Global Research Context is particularly vital during Step 4 (Research Plan Reflection) and Step 5 (Research Plan Update). By accessing this centralized memory, the Planning agent can perform a methodical process of reasoning that synthesizes low-level search results into higher-level insights. Specifically, the importance of the Global Context in these stages includes:\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nAvoiding Redundancy: The Planning agent reviews the existing search trajectories to ensure that subsequent plan updates do not repeat previously explored queries, optimizing the efficiency of the research loop.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\n\\nDynamic Plan Refinement: Access to the full research history (global context) enables the agent to reason about current progress and make intelligent, real-time modifications to the plan based on evidence found, rather than adhering to a rigid, pre-defined structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.\\n\\nInformed Decision-Making: The model uses the \\u201dglobal context\\u201d to decide which areas remain unexplored, ensuring that the updated research plan targets the most relevant and high-impact information gaps.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUnlike parallel architectures that isolate sub-topic research presented in Static DRA [link] and GPT Researcher (link), the global research context ensures that Step 7 (One-Shot Report Generation) is informed by a holistic understanding of the research topic, leading to more insightful and integrated final reports.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4 Sequential Research Plan Refinement via Reflection\\n\\nThe Sequential Research Plan Refinement via Reflection module is the core mechanism that enables our Deep Researcher to adapt its investigative strategy dynamically. Unlike static research architectures that follow a rigid, pre-defined path, this module empowers the Planning agent to evaluate its current progress and pivot based on the information discovered.\\n\\n\\nThe refinement process is executed in two distinct phases:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nReflection Phase (Step 4): The Planning agent performs a critical review of the existing research plan against the Global Research Context. It assesses whether the current search results satisfy the initial research goals or if new, unforeseen sub-topics have emerged that require deeper investigation. This \\u201dlook back\\u201d capability allows the agent to identify gaps in knowledge that a parallel approach might overlook.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nUpdate Phase (Step 5): If the reflection phase identifies a need for adjustment, the Planning agent modifies the research plan at runtime. These modifications may include adding new research steps, re-prioritizing existing tasks, or terminating paths that have proven to be redundant.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis sequential approach leverages findings from previous cycles to facilitate informed decision-making. By building each research chain upon the previous attempt, we align with findings from the Sequential Edge [7] paper, which suggests that sequential scaling consistently outperforms parallel self-consistency by allowing models to reason with fuller, more integrated context. This ensures that the research trajectory remains efficient, avoiding the \\u201dsiloed\\u201d knowledge problem common in parallel scaling architectures like GPT Researcher [2] or Static-DRA [6].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.5 One Shot Report Generation\\n\\nThe One Shot Report Generation module (Step 7) serves as the final synthesis stage of the research process. Unlike architectures such as Google\\u2019s TTD-DR (Test Time Diffusion - Deep Research) [4], which utilize a \\u201dReport-level Denoising\\u201d process to iteratively refine a noisy initial draft through multiple diffusion-inspired steps, our system employs a single, comprehensive generation phase.\\n\\n\\nIn this stage, a specialized LLM agent, designated as the Report Writer, is granted full access to the Global Research Context and the final, refined Research Plan. This access ensures that the agent can draw upon the entire trajectory of search queries, synthesized answers from the Candidate Crossover algorithm, and raw contextual artifacts such as facts and figures gathered during the sequential iterations. By processing this holistic dataset in a single inference pass, the Report Writer can:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nIntegrate Complex Information: Synthesize findings from disparate research branches into a cohesive narrative without the \\u201dsiloed\\u201d knowledge gaps common in parallel scaling architectures.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nMaintain Narrative Consistency: Ensure a unified tone and logical flow throughout the document, as the entire report is generated with the same global perspective.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\n\\nEnsure Fact Density: Utilize the centralized memory to include specific numbers, dates, and evidence discovered during the search phases, producing a detailed report suitable for PhD-level research topics.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis approach prioritizes computational efficiency and reduced latency by avoiding the multiple refinement cycles, while still maintaining high output quality by leveraging the high-fidelity context built during the sequential reflection phases.\\n\\n\\n\", \"4 Evaluation\": \"\\n\\n4 Evaluation\\n\\nOur Deep Researcher is evaluated against the globally recognized DeepResearch Bench [9]. As the primary benchmark for general-purpose Deep Research Agents (DRAs), it comprises 100 doctoral-level research tasks across 22 distinct fields.

The system\\u2019s core innovations are the Sequential Research Plan Refinement via Reflection and the Candidates Crossover algorithm. Sequential refinement enables the agent to maintain a centralized Global Research Context, allowing it to dynamically adapt its research plan, avoid redundant searches, and overcome the \\u201dsiloed knowledge\\u201d problem inherent in parallel architectures like Static-DRA and GPT Researcher. The Candidates Crossover algorithm further optimized search efficiency by deploying multiple LLM agents with varied parameters to explore a larger search space, with their findings synthesized for a comprehensive final response.\\n\\n\\nThe effectiveness of this approach was demonstrated through rigorous evaluation on the DeepResearch Bench, a global benchmark of 100 doctoral-level research tasks. Powered by the gemini-2.5-pro model, our Deep Researcher achieved a superior overall score of 46.21, significantly surpassing several leading deep research agents. These results reinforce the critical finding that sequential scaling consistently outperforms the parallel self-consistency paradigm, validating the system\\u2019s ability to generate highly detailed, fact-dense reports suitable for PhD-level research using a One Shot Report Generation process that maintains computational efficiency.\\n\\n\"}, \"bibliography\": {\"[1]\": \"\\n[1]\\nM.

Recent systems  (lu2024aiscientist; yamada2025aiscientistv2; gottweis_towards_2025) demonstrate that LLM-based agents can autonomously execute an end-to-end research loop, including literature review, code generation, experiment execution, and manuscript drafting. These results suggest that automated scientific discovery is becoming practically feasible and that LLM-based agents are approaching a level of functional completeness required for autonomous research (jin_agentreview_2024; sahu_reviewertoo_2025; ajith2024litsearch; zhang_noveltybench_2025; zhang2026opennovelty).\\n\\n\\nDespite this progress, existing systems remain constrained by a fundamental inefficiency in their execution paradigm, which limits their scalability and robustness in practice. In particular, most current research agents (wang_openhands_2025; yang_swe-agent_2024; mitchener_kosmos_2025; luo2025llm4sr) rely on an on-the-spot computation strategy, where nearly all information acquisition, reasoning, and synthesis are performed online at runtime. Under this paradigm, each new research attempt requires the agent to dynamically retrieve large volumes of scientific literature, read and summarize long and heterogeneous documents in real time, and explore a broad space of candidate methods and experimental designs through open-ended generation and trial-and-error. As a result, the cost of producing a single effective scientific discovery remains substantial. For example, a complete execution of the overall pipeline often requires several hours and, in some cases, up to 15 hours to progress from ideation to experimentation (lu2024aiscientist). Similarly, in (schmidgall_agent_2025), literature review and experimental planning alone account for a significant portion of total inference time and place heavy demands on the language model\\u2019s ability to maintain coherent reasoning over long contexts. More importantly, this runtime-centric design repeatedly forces the model to re-process large volumes of unstructured and partially redundant information, even when much of the underlying scientific knowledge is already well established, thereby increasing computational overhead and exacerbating the risk of hallucination and reasoning errors (wang2025repomaster; shin_mind_2025).\\n\\n\\nTo address the efficiency and reliability limitations of existing autonomous research agents, we propose Idea2Story, a scientific discovery framework that explicitly separates offline knowledge construction from online research generation, with the goal of reducing repeated reasoning over scientific literature and alleviating the context window bottleneck of large language models. Most current systems rely on runtime-centric execution, where agents repeatedly retrieve, read, summarize, and reason over large collections of highly overlapping papers for each new research attempt, resulting in substantial computational cost and prolonged execution time. Idea2Story mitigates this inefficiency by shifting literature understanding from online reasoning to an offline stage. In the offline phase, the system periodically collects recently accepted, peer-reviewed papers together with their full review feedback, extracts core methodological units and research patterns, and organizes these units and their observed composition relations into a continuously updated structured knowledge graph. This knowledge graph serves as a compact and reusable representation of established scientific methods and their empirical compatibility, replacing repeated processing of raw documents at runtime. Building on this offline knowledge infrastructure, Idea2Story performs online research generation by aligning underspecified user research intents with existing research paradigms encoded in the knowledge graph. Rather than relying on open-ended generation and trial-and-error, the system retrieves high-quality research patterns as structured compositions of method units, which act as stable methodological blueprints for downstream experimental design and execution. Guided by these validated research patterns, Idea2Story conducts feasibility-driven experimentation and ultimately generates a complete, submission-ready paper in an end-to-end manner.\\n\\n\\nFigure 1:  Overview of the two-stage framework in Idea2Story. The offline stage constructs a structured knowledge graph by extracting and organizing reusable method units from a curated paper corpus. The online stage retrieves and composes research patterns from the knowledge graph to ground underspecified user intent into concrete and coherent research directions.\\n\\n\\nOur work makes the following contributions to autonomous scientific discovery :\\n(1) We introduce Idea2Story, a framework that formalizes autonomous research as a\\npre-computation\\u2013driven process, where scientific knowledge is extracted, structured, and\\nmaintained in a continuously updated methodological knowledge graph, addressing the inefficiency and\\nunreliability of runtime-centric research agents. (2) We propose a knowledge-grounded planning and execution pipeline that alleviates the context window bottleneck and reduces repeated runtime reasoning over literature by converting paper reading into retrieval over a pre-built knowledge graph. (3) We conduct preliminary empirical studies and comparative evaluations, demonstrating that Idea2Story can produce several high-quality research demos and establishing the practical feasibility of the proposed paradigm in an end-to-end setting.\\n\\n\", \"2 Related Work\": \"\\n\\n2 Related Work\\n\\n\\n2.1 Autonomous Scientific Discovery\\n\\nRecent advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven growing interest in autonomous scientific\\ndiscovery agents that aim to automate the full research lifecycle, from code generation to experimental\\nexecution  (hu_controlled_2026; zhang2025evolving; lin_se-agent_2025). Early systems such as The AI Scientist (v1) (lu2024aiscientist) demonstrate the\\nviability of end-to-end automation but rely heavily on manually crafted code templates and largely\\nlinear exploration workflows, which restrict discovery depth and adaptability. Later approaches, including\\nThe AI Scientist-v2 (yamada2025aiscientistv2) and Kosmos (mitchener_kosmos_2025), reduce reliance on\\nexplicit template through the incorporation of agentic tree search and experiment management agents, enabling iterative and multi-round exploration.\\n\\n\\nIn research ideation, LLM-generated ideas are often perceived as highly novel during initial screening; however, prior studies (si2024can) uncover a critical paradox whereby such ideas tend to underperform after implementation relative to human-generated ideas, indicating limited feasibility and practical\\nutility. As more ideas are generated, LLM outputs exhibit growing similarity, leading to diminished meaningful diversity. Similar limitations have also been observed in research evaluation and peer\\nreview (liang2024can; xu2025can; thakkar_can_2025; zhang2026opennovelty). Existing AI-based reviewers display systematic blind\\nspots: shin_mind_2025 shows that LLM reviewers place disproportionate\\nemphasis on technical correctness while undervaluing novelty, deviating from human\\nexpert judgment, while sahu_reviewertoo_2025 demonstrates that AI reviewers\\nstruggle to distinguish fine-grained acceptance categories and are susceptible to sycophancy, with\\nreview scores increasing unreasonably after exposure to author rebuttals. Although recent approaches\\nsuch as AgentReview (jin_agentreview_2024) seek to mitigate these deficiencies by simulating\\ndiverse reviewer roles, automated evaluation systems remain less reliable than human experts in\\nidentifying robust accept/reject decision boundaries.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2.2 LLM-Driven Agents\\n\\nLLM-driven agents still struggle to interact effectively with complex real-world environments.\\nDespite their strong generative capabilities, many existing systems\\u2014such as OpenHands (wang_openhands_2025)\\nand SWE-Agent (yang_swe-agent_2024)\\u2014exhibit limited performance when applied to realistic\\ncodebases. These limitations largely stem from insufficient reasoning over hierarchical dependencies\\nand structural constraints, as well as the inherent restrictions imposed by finite context windows.\\nAs a result, LLM-driven agents achieve relatively low task completion rates on challenging benchmarks\\nsuch as MLE-bench (chan_mlebench_2024) and SciCode (tian_scicode_2024).\\nRepoMaster (wang2025repomaster) further identifies inadequate modeling of codebase structure,\\nincluding function call graphs and module dependency graphs, as a key bottleneck for LLM-driven agents\\noperating in large and complex environments.\\n\\n\\nBeyond execution limitations, LLM-driven agents also exhibit notable deficiencies in scientific rigor\\nand evaluative judgment. When tasked with autonomous assessment, these agents are prone to hallucination and overconfidence. For instance, Agent Laboratory (schmidgall_agent_2025) reports that automated evaluations produced by LLM-driven agents substantially overestimate paper quality compared to human reviewers. Evaluations of Kosmos (mitchener_kosmos_2025) further reveal a tendency to invent opaque quantitative metrics and to conflate statistical significance with scientific value, leading to weak interpretability of experimental conclusions. Moreover, long-horizon autonomous execution exacerbates these issues by introducing behavioral\\ndrift (arike2025tech), where LLM-driven agents gradually deviate from intended research trajectories or generate overly strong and insufficiently justified claims (lu2024aiscientist; schmidgall2025agent; baek_researchagent_2025; hong_metagpt_2023; wu_autogen_2023; lin_se-agent_2025; hu_controlled_2026). This drift further undermines reliability and highlights the\\nneed for stronger structural grounding and validation mechanisms in LLM-based autonomous research\\nsystems.\\n\\n\\n\", \"3 General Idea Generation\": \"\\n\\n3 General Idea Generation\\n\\nIdea2Story is designed to interact with users through high-level and often informal research ideas\\nthat reflect human intuition rather than fully specified technical plans.

Instead of performing document-level reasoning at runtime, Idea2Story\\npre-computes a structured representation of prior work that captures both methodological\\nabstractions and their observed compatibility in accepted research. This stage consists of three\\nmain components: (i) constructing a curated paper pool from peer-reviewed venues, (ii) extracting\\ncore method units that represent reusable methodological contributions, and (iii) organizing these\\nunits and their composition relations into a structured knowledge graph. Together, these components\\nform a persistent methodological memory that decouples literature understanding from downstream\\nidea grounding and research generation.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1.1 Paper Pool Construction\\n\\nWe construct a paper pool from accepted machine learning papers and their associated peer reviews\\ncollected from top-tier conferences.

The introduction is used to identify the\\nhigh-level research motivation and the precise problem formulation, the method section provides\\nsignals about core technical mechanisms such as modeling assumptions, learning objectives, model\\narchitectures, and optimization strategies, and the experiments section reflects how these\\nmechanisms are instantiated and evaluated in practice. By jointly aggregating information from\\nthese sections, the extractor isolates method units that correspond to the primary algorithmic or\\nmodeling contributions of the paper, rather than surface-level experimental details.\\n\\n\\nWe define a method unit u\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb0pu\\\\in\\\\mathcal{U}_{p} as a self-contained description of how a research\\nproblem is formulated or solved, abstracted away from specific implementation choices and\\nexperimental configurations. Elements that primarily involve dataset selection, hyperparameter\\ntuning, or engineering-level optimizations are excluded unless they induce substantive changes to\\nthe problem formulation, model structure, or learning objective. In practice, most papers yield one\\nor a small number of method units. Each extracted unit is further normalized into structured\\nmethodological attributes, including atomic meta-methods, which correspond to indivisible\\nmethodological elements, and composition-level patterns, which describe how multiple method\\nunits are combined within a single paper.\\n\\n\\nAfter extracting method units for all papers, we represent each paper p\\u2208\\ud835\\udcab~p\\\\in\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}}\\nby a vector embedding derived from its associated method units. Formally, let\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc33p=g\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb0p),\\\\mathbf{z}_{p}=g(\\\\mathcal{U}_{p}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udcb0p\\\\mathcal{U}_{p} denotes the set of extracted method units for paper pp and\\ng\\u200b(\\u22c5)g(\\\\cdot) is an embedding function that maps a set of method units to a fixed-dimensional\\nrepresentation.\\n\\n\\nTo induce higher-level research patterns, we first apply a nonlinear dimensionality reduction\\noperator\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc32p=UMAP\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc33p),\\\\mathbf{y}_{p}=\\\\mathrm{UMAP}(\\\\mathbf{z}_{p}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhich projects the high-dimensional embeddings into a lower-dimensional space while preserving\\nlocal semantic neighborhoods. We then perform density-based clustering on the reduced\\nrepresentations using DBSCAN, yielding a partition\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9e={C1,\\u2026,CM},\\\\mathcal{C}=\\\\{C_{1},\\\\dots,C_{M}\\\\},\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere each cluster Cm\\u2282\\ud835\\udcab~C_{m}\\\\subset\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}} corresponds to a coherent research pattern.\\n\\n\\nThese induced clusters serve as higher-level abstractions over individual papers, capturing\\nrecurring methodological structures that are reused across the literature. The resulting research\\npatterns form the basis for subsequent retrieval and composition.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2:  Offline knowledge graph construction in Idea2Story. Academic papers and their associated review artifacts are first anonymized and safety-filtered, then deconstructed into layered methodological representations. These layers capture complementary aspects of a paper, including its core research idea, domain context, high-level story skeleton, and packaging actions. The extracted elements are normalized into atomic method units and meta-methods, which are connected through composition and similarity relations. Reviewer feedback is incorporated as additional signals to refine relations and validate abstractions. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1.3 Knowledge Graph Construction\\n\\nBuilding on the extracted method units, we organize reusable methodological components into a\\nstructured knowledge graph that supports systematic method discovery and composition. While\\nindividual method units capture isolated algorithmic or modeling ideas, effective research methods\\nin practice typically arise from structured combinations of multiple method units. The knowledge\\ngraph provides a unified representation that explicitly encodes canonicalized method units,\\nmeta-methods, and their empirically observed composition relations in prior work.\\n\\n\\nFormally, we define the knowledge graph as a directed graph\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udca2=(\\ud835\\udcb1,\\u2130),\\\\mathcal{G}=(\\\\mathcal{V},\\\\mathcal{E}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere each node v\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb1v\\\\in\\\\mathcal{V} corresponds to a canonicalized method unit or a meta-method.\\nCanonicalization groups semantically similar method units across the corpus into shared\\nmeta-method abstractions, reducing surface-level variation while preserving core methodological\\nintent. As a result, nodes in the graph represent atomic or minimally indivisible methodological\\nelements that are reused across papers.\\n\\n\\nEdges in the graph encode composition relations between method units. For a given paper\\np\\u2208\\ud835\\udcab~p\\\\in\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}} with extracted method unit set \\ud835\\udcb0p\\\\mathcal{U}_{p}, we add directed edges\\nbetween pairs of method units (ui,uj)\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb0p\\u00d7\\ud835\\udcb0p(u_{i},u_{j})\\\\in\\\\mathcal{U}_{p}\\\\times\\\\mathcal{U}_{p} to indicate that\\nthey are jointly instantiated as part of the same methodological pipeline. These edges capture\\nempirical evidence of method compatibility observed in prior work, reflecting how different\\nmethod units are combined in practice rather than hypothetical or manually specified relations.\\n\\n\\nAggregating composition relations across the full corpus yields a graph structure that encodes both\\nmethodological abstraction and empirical compatibility. In particular, the graph captures two\\ncomplementary levels of structure: (i) reusable methodological elements represented as\\ncanonicalized method units and meta-methods, and (ii) composition constraints induced from\\nco-occurrence statistics in accepted papers. This separation allows Idea2Story to reason about\\nmethods at a higher level of abstraction than individual papers, while remaining grounded in\\nobserved research practice.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2 Online Research Generation.\\n\\nGiven a target research objective, Idea2Story treats method discovery as a graph-based retrieval and\\ncomposition problem over \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G}. The system retrieves relevant subgraphs and composes\\ncompatible method units by following connectivity constraints in the graph, producing candidate\\nresearch patterns that correspond to structured combinations of method units. These research\\npatterns serve as high-level methodological blueprints that bridge abstract research intent and\\nconcrete experimental design, enabling downstream planning, feasibility analysis, and end-to-end\\npaper generation.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2.1 Research Pattern Retrieval\\n\\nGiven a user-provided research idea expressed in natural language, we formulate research pattern\\nidentification as a structured retrieval problem over the knowledge graph \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G}. Let\\nqq denote the input research idea, and let \\ud835\\udc9e={C1,\\u2026,CM}\\\\mathcal{C}=\\\\{C_{1},\\\\dots,C_{M}\\\\} denote the set of\\nresearch patterns induced from the paper corpus. The goal is to rank patterns in \\ud835\\udc9e\\\\mathcal{C}\\naccording to their relevance to qq.\\n\\n\\nRather than relying on a single similarity metric, Idea2Story adopts a multi-view retrieval\\nformulation that aggregates complementary signals from different semantic abstractions.

Let \\u2110\\\\mathcal{I} denote the set of stored research ideas extracted\\nfrom the corpus, and let simidea\\u200b(q,i)\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{idea}}(q,i) denote a semantic similarity function\\nbetween qq and an idea i\\u2208\\u2110i\\\\in\\\\mathcal{I}. The idea-level score of a research pattern CmC_{m} is\\ncomputed by aggregating the similarity scores of ideas associated with the pattern:\\n\\n\\n\\nsidea\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)=maxi\\u2208\\u2110\\u200b(Cm)\\u2061simidea\\u200b(q,i),s_{\\\\text{idea}}(C_{m}\\\\mid q)=\\\\max_{i\\\\in\\\\mathcal{I}(C_{m})}\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{idea}}(q,i),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u2110\\u200b(Cm)\\\\mathcal{I}(C_{m}) denotes the set of ideas linked to pattern CmC_{m}.\\n\\n\\n\\nDomain-level retrieval.\\n\\nAt the domain level, the system interprets the input idea qq in terms of its underlying research\\ndomains and methodological themes. Let \\ud835\\udc9f\\\\mathcal{D} denote the set of research domains, and let\\nsimdomain\\u200b(q,d)\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{domain}}(q,d) measure the relevance between qq and domain d\\u2208\\ud835\\udc9fd\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}.\\nThe domain-level score of pattern CmC_{m} is computed as\\n\\n\\n\\nsdomain\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)=\\u2211d\\u2208\\ud835\\udc9f\\u200b(Cm)simdomain\\u200b(q,d)\\u200bw\\u200b(d,Cm),s_{\\\\text{domain}}(C_{m}\\\\mid q)=\\\\sum_{d\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}(C_{m})}\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{domain}}(q,d)\\\\,w(d,C_{m}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udc9f\\u200b(Cm)\\\\mathcal{D}(C_{m}) denotes the domains associated with pattern CmC_{m}, and w\\u200b(d,Cm)w(d,C_{m}) captures\\nempirical effectiveness signals derived from the knowledge graph.\\n\\n\\n\\nPaper-level retrieval.\\n\\nAt the paper level, the system retrieves papers whose technical content is semantically aligned\\nwith the input idea. Let \\ud835\\udcab\\u200b(Cm)\\\\mathcal{P}(C_{m}) denote the set of papers instantiating pattern CmC_{m}.\\nThe paper-level score is computed as\\n\\n\\n\\nspaper\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)=maxp\\u2208\\ud835\\udcab\\u200b(Cm)\\u2061simpaper\\u200b(q,p)\\u22c5\\u03b1\\u200b(p),s_{\\\\text{paper}}(C_{m}\\\\mid q)=\\\\max_{p\\\\in\\\\mathcal{P}(C_{m})}\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{paper}}(q,p)\\\\cdot\\\\alpha(p),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere simpaper\\u200b(q,p)\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{paper}}(q,p) measures semantic similarity between qq and paper pp,\\nand \\u03b1\\u200b(p)\\\\alpha(p) denotes a quality-related weight derived from peer review metadata.\\n\\n\\nThe final ranked list of research patterns is obtained by ordering patterns according to their\\naggregated multi-view relevance scores. Formally, we define\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9e\\u2217\\u200b(q)=RankCm\\u2208\\ud835\\udc9e\\u2061(\\u2211v\\u2208{idea,domain,paper}\\u03bbv\\u200bsv\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)),\\\\mathcal{C}^{*}(q)=\\\\operatorname{Rank}_{C_{m}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{C}}\\\\left(\\\\sum_{v\\\\in\\\\{\\\\text{idea},\\\\text{domain},\\\\text{paper}\\\\}}\\\\lambda_{v}\\\\,s_{v}(C_{m}\\\\mid q)\\\\right),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere patterns are sorted in descending order of the aggregated score.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2.2 Review-Guided Refinement\\n\\nAfter candidate research patterns are retrieved, Idea2Story refines them using an explicit\\nLLM-based review loop. In each iteration, a large language model is prompted to act as a reviewer\\nand evaluate the current research pattern along several predefined criteria, including technical\\nsoundness, novelty with respect to existing literature, and overall clarity of the problem\\u2013method\\nalignment. The reviewer produces both scalar judgments and concrete revision suggestions.\\n\\n\\nThe system then uses this feedback to update the research pattern in a targeted manner. When the\\nreview indicates insufficient novelty, the system modifies the pattern by recombining compatible\\nmethod units or introducing alternative realizations within the same pattern family. When the\\nreview identifies issues in feasibility or ambiguity in formulation, the system revises the problem\\ndefinition or method structure to improve consistency and executability. Each revised pattern is\\nre-submitted to the same review process, forming an explicit generate\\u2013review\\u2013revise loop.\\n\\n\\nTo prevent uncontrolled drift, only revisions that improve the reviewer scores are retained;\\notherwise, the system rolls back to the previous version. This process repeats until the reviewer\\njudges the pattern to be sufficiently novel, coherent, and technically plausible, or until further\\niterations no longer yield improvement. The output of this stage is a refined research pattern that\\nhas been iteratively vetted by an LLM-based reviewer and is suitable for downstream validation and\\npaper generation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"4 Experiments and Analysis\": \"\\n\\n4 Experiments and Analysis\\n\\nWe evaluate Idea2Story through a set of experiments focusing on its ability to extract reusable\\nmethodological structure and to generate high-quality research patterns from ambiguous user input.\\nOur experiments are conducted on a corpus of accepted papers from ICLR and NeurIPS over the past\\nthree years, including approximately 13K papers and their associated peer reviews, which serves as\\nthe foundation for all subsequent analyses. Based on this corpus, we first analyze the properties of the extracted method units to assess whether Idea2Story captures meaningful and reusable methodological abstractions. We then present qualitative demonstrations of research patterns instantiated as structured research stories, illustrating how the system transforms vague research intent into coherent and methodologically grounded research directions.\\n\\n\\n\\nCase 1: Method Unit Extraction Demo\\n\\n\\nPaper Title:\\nLearning Dynamics of LLM Finetuning\\nBase Problem:\\nUnderstanding how specific training examples influence model predictions during finetuning is challenging, particularly in large language models.\\nSolution Pattern:\\nDevelop a framework to analyze step-wise influence accumulation among potential responses during finetuning, providing insights into phenomena like hallucination and the squeezing effect in off-policy direct preference optimization.\\nStory:\\nReframe the understanding of LLM finetuning through the lens of learning dynamics, offering a unified interpretation of training behaviors and inspiring methods to enhance model alignment and performance.\\nApplication:\\nImproving alignment in large language models, enhancing finetuning strategies for better model performance, diagnosing and mitigating hallucination in AI systems.\\n\\nFigure 3: An example of a method unit extracted from an accepted paper, illustrating the separation of the base problem, solution pattern, and higher-level research story.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.1 Implementation Details\\n\\nTo further assess the effectiveness of Idea2Story in practical research ideation settings, we\\nconduct additional qualitative experiments on a small set of representative cases. Specifically,\\nwe evaluate three user-provided research ideas curated by an external collaborator. For each case,\\nIdea2Story generates research patterns using the GLM-4.7 (zeng2025glm) model as the underlying language backbone. As a baseline, we compare against direct LLM generation, where the same model is prompted to produce a complete research story without explicit pattern modeling or retrieval.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.2 Case Study: Method Unit Extraction\\n\\nWe present a representative case study to illustrate the behavior of the proposed method unit\\nextraction agent. Case 1 shows an example extracted from an accepted paper, where the system decomposes the full paper into a structured set of methodological elements.\\n\\n\\nAs shown in the example, the extracted method unit explicitly separates the underlying research\\nproblem, the core solution pattern, and the resulting research story. The Base Problem describes the core challenge addressed by the paper, namely understanding how individual training examples influence model behavior during finetuning, without depending on specific datasets or implementation details. The Solution Pattern summarizes the central methodological idea as\\nan analysis framework for step-wise influence accumulation, highlighting the key mechanism without\\nbinding it to a particular optimization setup or experimental configuration. Importantly, the extracted Story reframes the technical contribution at a higher level of\\nabstraction, connecting learning dynamics to broader phenomena such as hallucination and alignment\\nin large language models. This abstraction reflects how the method unit goes beyond algorithmic\\ndetails to capture the conceptual contribution of the paper. Finally, the Application\\nfield grounds the method unit by indicating downstream research and system-level implications,\\nwithout enumerating task-specific benchmarks.\\n\\n\\nThis example demonstrates that the extraction agent isolates reusable methodological structure while\\nfiltering out implementation-level details. By representing the paper as a coherent method unit\\nrather than a collection of experimental components, Idea2Story enables subsequent reuse,\\ncomparison, and composition of methodological ideas across papers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3 Knowledge Graph Analysis\\n\\nWe analyze the structure of the constructed knowledge graph to understand how extracted method\\nunits are distributed across papers and research domains. As illustrated in Figure 2, the graph\\nexhibits a clear hub-and-spoke structure, where a small number of high-frequency domains connect\\nto a large number of papers and research patterns. This reflects the uneven distribution of\\nresearch activity across domains, while also highlighting domains that function as central hubs\\nfor methodological reuse. Importantly, many research patterns are observed to connect multiple\\ndomains simultaneously, indicating that the extracted method units often capture methodological\\nabstractions that generalize beyond a single application area. In contrast, paper-level nodes are typically associated with a single domain, whereas pattern-level nodes frequently act as bridges between otherwise weakly connected domains. This structural separation suggests that the knowledge graph encodes two distinct levels of organization\\u2014instance-level\\n\\nFigure 4: Visualization of the knowledge graph substructure induced by high-frequency research\\ndomains.\\n\\n\\nresearch artifacts and reusable methodological abstractions\\u2014enabling Idea2Story to retrieve and compose research patterns at a higher level of abstraction rather than relying on domain-specific or paper-specific similarity alone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAspect\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIdea2Story Generated (IntentDiff)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLLM Direct Generated (EcoIntent)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTitle\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIntentDiff: Reframing E-commerce Intent Classification via Structural Evolution and Context-Aware Diffusion\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEcoIntent: A Context-Aware Multi-Granularity Agent for E-commerce Intent Understanding via Hierarchical Contrastive Learning\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbstract Focus\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReinterprets intent classification as a structural evolution process rather than static text classification. The approach leverages a diffusion-based framework to iteratively refine noisy query representations into precise intent labels, integrates product graph embeddings to ground predictions in e-commerce context, and introduces a discrete, context-aware tokenizer to handle long-tail domain vocabulary.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTargets improved intent classification performance by integrating heterogeneous behavioral context and hierarchical product knowledge.

The main challenge is semantic sparsity caused by short and ambiguous queries.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCore Research Gap\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExisting intent classification methods treat queries in isolation and ignore domain-specific structural priors in e-commerce. They fail to exploit rich relationships between products and attributes, and standard vocabularies struggle with long-tail, domain-specific terminology. No prior work unifies diffusion-based refinement with structural graph embeddings for intent disambiguation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrior work suffers from (1) context isolation, where behavioral signals such as clicks are underutilized, and (2) a flat-label assumption that ignores the hierarchical nature of e-commerce taxonomies, leading to inconsistent predictions for fine-grained, long-tail intents.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMethod Skeleton\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA diffusion-based classifier that iteratively denoises intent representations; a context-aware discrete tokenizer based on a VQ-VAE variant to encode diverse e-commerce queries; and integration of pretrained product graph embeddings as structural priors during the denoising process.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA dual-stream discriminative architecture consisting of a BERT-based text encoder, a lightweight GNN for aggregating behavioral interaction graphs, and a prediction head trained with hierarchical contrastive learning; parameter-efficient adaptation via LoRA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInnovation Claims\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(1) Reformulates intent classification as a diffusion-based dynamic refinement process;\\n(2) Introduces discrete, context-aware intent tokenization to better handle long-tail domain vocabulary;\\n(3) Enhances intent reasoning by incorporating product graph structural embeddings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(1) Contextualized intent modeling via joint reasoning over text and behavioral graphs;\\n(2) Hierarchical contrastive learning leveraging product taxonomies;\\n(3) Parameter-efficient system design achieving strong performance at reduced computational cost.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 1: \\nComparison of research patterns generated by Idea2Story and a direct LLM baseline,\\nboth starting from the same underspecified user input:\\n\\u201cI want to build an e-commerce agent that can better understand user intent.\\u201d\\nThe table contrasts how different generation mechanisms transform the same vague research intent\\ninto concrete research patterns.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.4 Qualitative Comparison of Generated Research Patterns\\n\\nWe further compare the quality of research patterns generated by Idea2Story and a direct LLM\\nbaseline. Both systems start from the same underspecified user input and produce structured\\nresearch proposals, enabling a controlled comparison of how different generation mechanisms\\ntransform vague research intent into concrete research patterns.\\n\\n\\nTable 1 presents a side-by-side comparison of representative outputs along multiple dimensions,\\nincluding problem formulation, methodological structure, and innovation claims. Rather than\\nevaluating surface-level writing quality, the comparison focuses on the resulting research\\npatterns as methodological blueprints\\u2014i.e., how the generated ideas frame the research problem,\\nidentify gaps in prior work, and organize methodological components into a coherent approach. As shown in the table, Idea2Story tends to induce higher-level problem reformulation, transforming\\nintent understanding from a fixed classification task into a dynamic structural reasoning process.\\nThe resulting research pattern emphasizes generative refinement, structural priors, and evolving\\nrepresentations. In contrast, the direct LLM baseline largely operates within a conventional task\\nformulation, proposing a stronger system through the integration of additional components such as\\ncontext modeling and hierarchical objectives.\\n\\n\\nTo reduce evaluation bias, the generated research stories from both approaches are subsequently\\nassessed by an independent large language model (Gemini 3 Pro) (team2025gemma), which is not involved in either generation process. The evaluator is instructed to compare the outputs in terms of novelty, methodological substance, and overall research quality, without access to the generation method\\nused. Across all evaluated cases, the externally evaluated results consistently favor the outputs\\ngenerated by Idea2Story. In particular, the research stories produced by direct LLM generation tend\\nto remain at a high level of abstraction, with less concrete methodological grounding and reliance\\non relatively standard techniques. In contrast, Idea2Story-generated research patterns exhibit\\nclearer problem framing, more specific methodological structures, and stronger signals of novelty.\\n\\n\\n\", \"5 Future Work\": \"\\n\\n5 Future Work\\n\\nWhile Idea2Story focuses on grounding vague research intent into structured and high-quality research patterns, an important direction for future work is to extend this framework toward a fully closed-loop research generation pipeline. A promising extension is the integration of experiment-driven agents that can instantiate, validate, and iteratively refine generated research patterns through empirical feedback, including automated experimental design, dataset selection, and preliminary execution. Experimental outcomes can then serve as additional signals to refine the instantiated research stories, forming a feedback loop between method design and empirical validation. Beyond experimentation, future work may further explore how refined research patterns can be systematically translated into complete paper drafts, covering method descriptions, experimental results, and discussion sections. By grounding paper generation in empirically validated research patterns, such a system could move beyond surface-level text generation and provide more faithful, end-to-end support for executable and publishable scientific discovery.\\n\\n\", \"6 Conclusion\": \"\\n\\n6 Conclusion\\n\\nWe presented Idea2Story, a pre-computation\\u2013driven framework for autonomous scientific discovery that shifts literature understanding from runtime reasoning to offline knowledge structuring. By explicitly extracting reusable method units and organizing them into a continuously updated knowledge graph, Idea2Story enables research agents to reason over stable research patterns rather than repeatedly processing raw papers. Our qualitative analyses and comparative studies show that this design leads to research patterns with clearer problem reformulation, stronger methodological structure, and higher conceptual novelty than direct LLM generation. These results highlight the importance of explicit pattern modeling as a foundation for scalable and reliable autonomous research. Looking ahead, integrating Idea2Story with experimental agents to close the loop from abstract research patterns to validated empirical results represents a promising direction toward fully autonomous and trustworthy scientific discovery.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"}, \"bibliography\": {}, \"domain\": \"cs.CE\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"351f9ff7-e324-4585-b53b-bf2bb1834b95\", \"authors\": [\"Jiangen He\", \"Wen Lou\"], \"title\": \"How Disciplinary Partnerships Shape Research Landscape in U.S. Library and Information Science Schools\", \"abstract\": \"This study provides the first comprehensive empirical mapping of how organizational structures and research portfolios co-occur across U.S. Library and Information Science (LIS) schools.

Unlike disciplines with clearly delineated theoretical frameworks and methodological canons, LIS draws its intellectual foundations from diverse fields including computer science, cognitive psychology, sociology, communication studies, and education [Larivire2012, Zhu2016]. This theoretical and methodological eclecticism is not incidental but constitutive: LIS scholarship evolves in dialogue with and often in response to developments in adjacent disciplines [Cronin2008, Furner2015].\\n\\n\\nThis interdisciplinary character has profound implications for how LIS units are positioned within universities. As the field has evolved, particularly with the rise of digital technologies and data science, LIS schools have increasingly reorganized themselves, forming partnerships with computer science departments, communication schools, education colleges, or positioning themselves as standalone information schools [Wiggins2012, Wu2012]. These structural choices are consequential, influencing faculty recruitment patterns, resource allocation, curriculum development, and ultimately the research agendas pursued by these institutions [Martzoukou2017].\\n\\n\\nYet this same interdisciplinarity that enriches LIS intellectually also creates ambiguity about institutional positioning. From university administrators\\u2019 perspectives, the question \\u201cWhere does LIS belong?\\u201d has no obvious answer [vakkari2024characterizes]. Should information schools align with computer science to emphasize computational methods? Partner with communication to emphasize the social dimensions of information? Affiliate with education to foreground information literacy? Or maintain independence to preserve disciplinary autonomy? These decisions are rarely made on purely intellectual grounds; institutional politics, resource constraints, and historical contingencies all play roles [Dillon2012, Marchionini2008].\\n\\n\\nThe relationship between organizational structure and research direction is unlikely to be unidirectional. While structure may shape research by influencing collaboration networks, hiring priorities, and resource access [Salancik1978, Whitley2000], research interests also drive structural choices as schools position themselves to align with faculty strengths and emerging opportunities [Mintzberg1979]. Previous scholarship has acknowledged this reciprocal relationship in principle but has provided limited empirical evidence about how it manifests in LIS specifically [Ma2012, Wiggins2012]. The result is a gap in our understanding: we lack systematic documentation of whether and how organizational structures and research profiles co-occur in patterned ways across the LIS field.\\n\\n\\nUnderstanding these patterns carries significance for multiple stakeholders. For academic leaders and strategic planners, empirical evidence about how organizational positioning relates to research profiles can inform decisions about restructuring, mergers, or partnership formations [King2017]. For accreditation bodies and professional organizations, these patterns raise questions about whether unified standards make sense when schools pursue such different research agendas [Juznic2003]. For doctoral students and early-career faculty, knowing how organizational structure relates to research environment helps inform program selection and career planning [Sugimoto2011]. For the field broadly, documenting the relationship between institutional diversity and intellectual diversity addresses ongoing debates about LIS identity, coherence, and future viability [Bawden2008, Cronin2005].\\n\\n\\nThis study addresses this gap by providing the first comprehensive empirical mapping of organizational structures and research landscapes in U.S. Library and Information Science schools. Specifically, we investigate three research questions:\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nRQ1: What is the intellectual structure of LIS research in the U.S., and what foundational dimensions define its landscape?\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nRQ2: How does the organizational structure of LIS schools relate to the composition of their research portfolios?\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\n\\nRQ3: How have the research priorities of LIS schools evolved over the past 12 years (2013\\u20132024), and does organizational type influence these evolutionary trajectories?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis study makes three primary contributions. First, we provide comprehensive documentation of how 44 U.S. LIS schools are organized and what research they produce, covering 14,705 publications between 2013 and 2024 published by 1,264 faculty members. Second, we develop a research landscape mapping that identifies 16 distinct research themes and three foundational research dimensions (Library and Knowledge Organization, Human-Centered Technology, and Computing Systems), providing a shared vocabulary for discussing LIS\\u2019s intellectual diversity. Third, we reveal systematic patterns in how organizational structures and research profiles co-occur, that challenge simplistic narratives about the field\\u2019s transformation. It provides an essential empirical foundation for future work and discussion using mixed-method designs to investigate the mechanisms linking structure and scholarship.\\n\\n\", \"2 Literature Review\": \"\\n\\n2 Literature Review\\n\\n\\n2.1 Evolving Identity of LIS\\n\\nThe intellectual core of Library and Information Science has perpetually been defined by its struggle and synergy with interdisciplinarity [Bates1999]. The field\\u2019s theoretical foundation is not a single, stable paradigm but a dynamic and often contentious conversation between imported frameworks and native concepts.\\n\\n\\nTheoretically, LIS has oscillated between embracing its identity as a \\u201cmeta-discipline\\u201d\\u2014a connector of other fields\\u2014and seeking a unique, unifying theory of its own [Cronin2005]. Early anchors in social epistemology and information behavior have been supplemented, and sometimes challenged, by computational and socio-technical theories borrowed from computer science, social informatics, and science and technology studies [Larivire2012]. This has led to a rich but fragmented theoretical landscape where a study on algorithmic bias in search engines and an ethnographic study of a public library\\u2019s community role can sit under the same disciplinary umbrella, speaking different theoretical languages.\\n\\n\\nMethodologically, this theoretical diversity is mirrored by a dramatic expansion from its qualitative, user-study roots. While surveys, interviews, and historical analysis remain vital, the field has undergone a pronounced \\u201ccomputational turn.\\u201d[lou2021temporally] Bibliometrics, once a niche specialty, is now a mainstream methodology. Network analysis, natural language processing, and data mining are increasingly common, pushing LIS research closer to the data sciences[yang2025quantifying]. This methodological borrowing is a double-edged sword: it increases technical rigor and relevance to the digital age but also risks diluting the field\\u2019s distinctive human-centered methodological heritage.\\n\\n\\nIn terms of application and boundaries, LIS has aggressively expanded from its traditional home in libraries and archives [Sugimoto2011]. Its applications now prominently include health informatics, where it contributes to patient data management and consumer health information [chen2024you]; scholarly communication, where it studies the entire research lifecycle from peer review to open science [van2025scholarly]; and social media analysis, where it investigates misinformation and online communities [diaz2019towards]. This boundary-pushing work is the field\\u2019s greatest source of vitality but also its greatest identity crisis. The core question remains: Is LIS defined by its core object of study (\\u201cinformation\\u201d) or by its unique perspective on that object, and if the latter, what precisely is that perspective?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2.2 Organizational Anatomy of LIS Schools\\n\\nThe intellectual tensions within LIS are physically and administratively manifested in the organizational structures of its academic units[Sugimoto2011]. A significant body of internal LIS research has dissected these structures, revealing how they function as engines that shape the field\\u2019s future [Wu2025].\\n\\n\\nA primary focus has been on faculty and research performance. Studies consistently show that an LIS school\\u2019s organizational partnership is a powerful predictor of its research output. Schools partnered with computer science departments tend to publish more in conference proceedings, secure larger grants, and have higher per-faculty publication counts in computationally intensive areas. In contrast, standalone iSchools often boast greater research diversity but may face challenges in achieving critical mass in any one area[bowman2021similarities, wang2025ischools, shah2021ischool]. Faculty hiring patterns are a key mechanism here; a school merging with a communications department will naturally hire faculty with mass media expertise, thereby steering its research agenda toward social media and public opinion[zuo2019standing].\\n\\n\\nAnother critical area of study is curriculum, education, and student outcomes. The syllabus is a direct reflection of organizational identity. Research analyzing course catalogs finds that LIS programs embedded in computer science colleges require more programming and data science courses, while those in education colleges emphasize pedagogy and instructional design. This curricular differentiation directly impacts student pathways [zhang2022creating, weintrop2022ischools]. Graduates from technically-oriented programs are funneled into tech industry roles like UX research and data analytics, while graduates from more traditional or socially-oriented programs more often enter academic, public, or school libraries. This creates a feedback loop where alumni success in a sector reinforces the school\\u2019s strategic focus on it.[huang2025we]\\n\\n\\nFinally, research on leadership, strategy, and accreditation examines the forces that create these structures in the first place. Deans and directors operate under significant pressure, making strategic choices about partnerships to secure resources, enhance prestige, or ensure survival in a competitive university environment [corieri2024ischool, lou2018research]. Accreditation bodies, like the American Library Association, represent another structural force, attempting to uphold core professional competencies across wildly different organizational models\\u2014a tension that raises fundamental questions about whether a unified set of standards can or should apply to such a diverse ecosystem. [bowman2021similarities]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2.3 Institutional Research in LIS\\n\\nThe LIS field has increasingly turned its analytical tools upon itself, generating a multi-layered body of institutional research that documents its own evolution from global to individual scales.\\n\\n\\nAt the macro (global/country) level, bibliometric studies dominate. These large-scale analyses map the field\\u2019s growth, identifying the most prolific nations, the most cited journals, and the rise and fall of major research themes over decades. They reveal, for instance, the ascendancy of China as a major contributor to LIS research and the global shift from \\\"library\\\" to \\\"information\\\" as a central focus. However, these macro-studies often treat \\\"LIS\\\" as a monolith, aggregating data in ways that can conceal the rich organizational diversity underneath. [zheng2025understanding, Rehman2024, Dora2020]\\n\\n\\nAt the meso (institutional/cross-institutional) level, the research becomes sparser. While case studies of individual iSchools or comparative analyses of a handful of programs exist [shah2021ischool, wang2025ischools, Wu2025, Zhu2016, zuo2019standing], there is a significant gap in comprehensive, systematic studies. We lack a clear field-wide understanding of how different organizational models correlate with differentiated research portfolios, faculty demographics, and funding patterns. This level is crucial because it is at the institutional level that strategic decisions are made and intellectual identities are most visibly formed and sustained.[he2025academic]\\n\\n\\nAt the micro (individual/faculty) level, research focuses on the lived experience of the field\\u2019s practitioners. This includes studies of doctoral students\\u2019 dissertation topics, which serve as a leading indicator of the field\\u2019s future direction. It also includes analyses of faculty publishing habits, collaboration networks, and professional identity, exploring how individual scholars navigate the competing demands of interdisciplinary work and departmental expectations [zhu2024dependency]. This level reveals the human impact of the macro trends and meso-level structures, showing how large-scale shifts in the field play out in the daily work and careers of its members [li2022worldwide, wiles2024teaching].\\n\\n\\nIn all, we have a rich understanding of LIS\\u2019s intellectual diversity and a growing, though less systematic, understanding of its organizational diversity . We also have robust theories from higher education studies suggesting these two should be linked [TorresZapata2019]. However, the crucial bridge\\u2014a comprehensive, empirical mapping of how specific organizational structures co-occur with specific research profiles\\u2014remains largely unbuilt. Our study addresses this by uniting these three strands: it uses the methods of macro-level institutional research to conduct a meso-level analysis of organizational types, in order to explain the intellectual identity and diversification of the field.\\n\\n\\n\", \"3 Methods\": \"\\n\\n3 Methods\\n\\nFour major steps compose the workflow of the study (Figure 1), including collecting data of LIS schools, faculty data in the schools over years, publication data of the faculty members from 2013 to 2024, and data analysis pipeline.\\n\\n\\nFigure 1: A workflow of the study, including the data collection and analysis.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1 School Data Collection\\n\\nWe used the list of Best Library and Information Studies Programs from U.S. News and World Report (ranked in 2021) to select schools for this study, in which there are 55 schools. We examine these 55 schools by visiting their website to code their organizational structure. (Step 1 in Figure 1). There are four types of schools that have been excluded from this study. (1) We excluded schools that offer only an LIS degree program without an academic unit of LIS (three schools). These programs may be emerging ones, but most of them do not have full-time faculty for the LIS program. (2) We exclude schools that do not have a school website (one school) or no faculty information online (two schools). (3) We exclude one school that cannot be identified in web archives (Step 2 in Figure 1). 4) We exclude four schools that do not have faculty publication data in Dimension (Step 3 in Figure 1). Eventually, 44 out of 55 schools were included in the study.\\n\\n\\nWe categorized the schools\\u2019 organizational types. We took into account the history of the school to code their organizational type. For example, the LIS school at the University at Albany\\u2013SUNY is currently aligned with Cybersecurity and Homeland Security, but it had been associated with computer science for many years before they formed the new school. Eventually, we identified five major types of academic structures among LIS schools. Table 1 shows a complete list of schools for the five types.\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nInformation: LIS units are standalone and independent, not sharing academic administration with any other discipline.

The most reliable approach involves identifying faculty members from institutional websites and subsequently gathering their publications by name, which presents a significant methodological challenge. Given that faculty recruitment patterns may reflect shifts in institutional research priorities, we employed the Internet Archive\\u2019s Wayback Machine to capture faculty information at multiple temporal points. We collected faculty data annually to characterize institutional research focus changes over three-year periods. For instance, faculty information from 2014 was used to identify publications from 2013, 2014, and 2015. Consequently, we gathered faculty data from 2014, 2017, 2020, and 2023 to cover publications spanning 2012 to 2024 (see Step 2 in Figure 1). For each institution at each data collection point, we began by searching the current faculty directory URL in the Wayback Machine and extracted faculty information from archived website snapshots. We utilized Python scripts to collect snapshot URLs for faculty data extraction. However, many directory page URLs had changed over time, requiring manual identification of the correct archived faculty directory pages. We employed institutional website URLs in the Wayback Machine to locate faculty directory page snapshots. When institutional websites had undergone structural changes, we navigated back to university-level snapshots to identify the appropriate school-level archives. In rare instances where university website URLs had changed completely, we utilized search engines to identify historical university website URLs. Through this systematic approach, we successfully collected archived snapshots of all LIS school faculty directory pages in 2014, 2017, 2020, and 2023. The snapshot URLs follow the standard Internet Archive format: \\u201chttps://web.archive.org/web/{timestamp}/{directory_page_URL}\\u201d.\\n\\n\\nAll faculty names were collected with the assistance of browser-use\\u2019s AI feature.\\nA standardized prompt was issued for each directory page to extract faculty information (see prompt in the Appendix).\\nWe manually validated all extracted records and consolidated them into a single table.\\nWe examined the data for abnormalities, such as implausible faculty entries in a given year or dramatic year-over-year changes.\\nAlthough some turnover is expected, substantial shifts are uncommon.\\nWhen anomalies were detected, we repeated data collection for that year manually.\\nAfter establishing broad consistency across years, we randomly selected one of the four collection points for detailed manual verification of accuracy.\\nIn total, we compiled 3,379 faculty records across the four collection points (745 in 2014, 823 in 2017, 805 in 2020, 1,006 in 2023), including tenure-track, tenured, and non-tenure-track full-time faculty, while excluding adjunct professors, visiting professors, and graduate students.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3 Publication Data Collection\\n\\nNext, we collected the publications of all faculty members (Step 3 in Figure 1).\\nWe used the Dimensions Analytics API (DSL v2) because it provides broad coverage of journals and conferences and supports author disambiguation.\\nBy merging faculty records across years by name and organization, we obtained 1,683 unique faculty records.\\nFor each faculty member, we first issued an exact-name query constrained by institutional affiliation: search researchers where first_name = \\\"{firstname}\\\" and last_name = \\\"{lastname}\\\" and research_orgs.id = \\\"{grid_id}\\\" return researchers, where {grid_id} is the GRID identifier of the faculty member\\u2019s university.\\nIf the exact query returned no result, we relaxed the first-name constraint to a fuzzy match using first_name \\u223c\\\\sim \\\"{firstname}\\\" while keeping the affiliation filter.\\nWhen multiple researcher records were returned for a faculty member, we retrieved recent publications for each candidate and manually identified those working in Library and Information Science or closely related areas.\\nUsing this procedure, 1,264 of 1,683 faculty were matched by name and organization.\\nOf these, 31 were manually disambiguated across multiple returned profiles.\\n\\n\\nWith the researcher IDs, we collected 23,001 publications for the 1,264 faculty members.\\nAmong these, 19,726 were unique publications.\\nWe queried publications using search publications where researchers = \\\"{dimension_id}\\\" return publications.\\nWe retained only records with Document Type in \\u2019RESEARCH_ARTICLE\\u2019, \\u2019CONFERENCE_PAPER\\u2019, \\u2019RESEARCH_CHAPTER\\u2019, \\u2019REVIEW_ARTICLE\\u2019, yielding 16,761 articles.\\nWe detected duplicate entries across preprint and published versions and removed them.\\nThe final deduplicated set contained 14,740 unique publications.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4 Research Theme Modeling and Visualization\\n\\nTo identify and analyze research themes in the field of Library and Information Science (LIS), we employed a state-of-the-art topic modeling approach that leverages transformer-based language models. Specifically, we used BERTopic [grootendorst2022bertopic], which combines the power of BERT-based text embeddings with clustering techniques to discover coherent and interpretable research themes from academic publications. Although BERTopic labels its clusters \\u201ctopics\\u201d, we refer to them as \\u201cresearch themes\\u201d because their granularity is closer to that of domain-level areas in LIS.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4.1 Embedding Generation\\n\\nWe extracted semantic representations from the titles and abstracts of all 14,705 publications using the SPECTER2 model [singh2023scirepeval], which is specifically designed for scholarly document representation. This model captures semantic relationships between academic papers more effectively than general-purpose language models. For each paper, we concatenated the title and abstract text with the SPECTER2 separation token and generated a 768-dimensional embedding vector that encodes the semantic content of the paper.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4.2 Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering\\n\\nThe high-dimensional embeddings were then processed through a multi-step pipeline for identifying research themes:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nDimensionality Reduction: We applied UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) to reduce the embeddings to 10 dimensions while preserving the semantic relationships between papers. This step facilitates more efficient clustering and visualization.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nHierarchical Clustering: We utilized Agglomerative Clustering to group the publications into 16 coherent research themes. This approach was selected after experimentation with HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), as it provided more balanced and interpretable theme clusters for our dataset. We experimented with different number of themes from 10 to 20. We use two basic rules to huristically determine the number of themes. First, the number of themes should be enough to cover all the major research themes without merging major themes into one theme, for example, \\\"Library Science\\\" and \\\"Metadata and Archives\\\" are two major related themes, but they should not be merged into one theme. Second, the themes should not be too similar to each other that can be merged into one theme. We found 16 themes is a good balance between these two rules.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\n\\nTheme Representation: To generate interpretable representations of each theme, we employed a Class-based TF-IDF (c-TF-IDF) transformation combined with Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) to extract distinctive keywords while ensuring diversity in the theme representations.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.\\n\\nTheme Labeling and Refinement\\nThe initial model identified 16 themes. After examining the themes, two small non-LIS topics were identified: \\u201cQuantum Communication\\u201d and \\u201cAtmospheric Chemistry\\u201d.\\nAlthough these topics included publications by LIS-affiliated faculty, they were not central to LIS research and involved only a few authors from LIS schools. We excluded 35 publications from these topics.\\nThe final dataset contained 14,705 publications. The final model contained 14 distinct research themes. For improved interpretability, we enhanced the theme labels using a GPT-4o based system. For each theme, we provided the model with a sample of 500 publication titles and requested concise, descriptive labels along with subtopics and a brief summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4.3 Visualization\\n\\nWe created several visualizations to facilitate the exploration and understanding of the LIS research landscape:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nResearch Landscape Map: Using UMAP, we reduced the embeddings to 2 dimensions for visualization purposes. Each point in the resulting map (Figure 2) represents a publication, colored according to its assigned theme. The size of each point corresponds to its citation count. The landscape map provides an intuitive overview of the proximity and boundaries between different research areas in LIS.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nTheme Distribution by School Type: To analyze the relationship between organizational structure and research focus, we created visualizations showing the distribution of research themes across different types of LIS schools (Figure 4).\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\n\\nUniversity Positioning: We mapped individual universities in the research landscape based on the aggregated embeddings of their faculty publications (Figure 5) by using principal component analysis (PCA), revealing institutional specializations and positioning within the broader LIS research ecosystem.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.\\n\\nTrend Analysis: To visualize the evolution of institutional research profiles, we aggregated the 16 research themes into three foundational dimensions (see Section 4.2). For each university, we calculated the annual proportion of publications in each dimension from 2013 to 2024. We restricted this analysis to 37 schools that met the criteria of having at least 50 publications and data spanning at least 5 years. To identify robust long-term trends amidst year-to-year volatility, we applied linear regression to these annual proportions for each dimension. We then used the regression models to predict the composition of research for the start year (2013) and end year (2024). These predicted start and end points were mapped onto a ternary coordinate system, with arrows connecting the 2013 position to the 2024 position to visualize the magnitude and direction of the shift. This approach allows for a clear depiction of how schools are repositioning themselves within the triangular conceptual space defined by the field\\u2019s three pillars. To categorize these evolutionary trajectories, we analyzed the change in the proportional share of each dimension (LKO, HCT, CS) between the predicted 2013 and 2024 coordinates. We defined a significance threshold of 5 percentage points based on a heuristic evaluation. This threshold provides a robust margin to distinguish meaningful strategic shifts from noise or minor fluctuations. Additionally, sensitivity testing indicated that this cutoff effectively captures the primary evolutionary trends, yielding a reasonable number of significant moves across the dataset without over-interpreting marginal changes. For each dimension, a university was classified as moving \\u201cToward\\u201d that dimension if its share increased by \\u22655%\\\\geq 5\\\\%, and \\u201cAway from\\u201d it if its share decreased by \\u22655%\\\\geq 5\\\\%. A university\\u2019s trajectory could be assigned multiple directional labels (e.g., matching both \\u201cAway from LKO\\u201d and \\u201cToward HCT\\u201d).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe resulting topic model and visualizations provide a comprehensive view of the current LIS research landscape in the United States, enabling analysis of how different organizational structures correlate with research themes and temporal evolution.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.5 Statistical Analysis\\n\\nTo statistically evaluate differences in research topic composition across the five organizational school types, we employed Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA).\\nThe topic distribution data (the proportion of publications in each research theme for each university) differs from standard Euclidean space data due to its compositional nature (proportions sum to 1). To address this, we applied the Centered Log-Ratio (CLR) transformation to the topic proportions.\\nAitchison distance (Euclidean distance on CLR-transformed data) was then calculated between all pairs of universities to form a distance matrix.\\nWe performed a global PERMANOVA test to assess whether significant overall differences existed among the groups.\\nFollowing a significant global result, we conducted pairwise PERMANOVA comparisons between all school type pairs.\\nWe employed Fisher\\u2019s Protected Least Significant Difference (LSD) procedure for pairwise comparisons to balance Type I and Type II error rates.\\n\\n\\n\", \"4 Results\": \"\\n\\n4 Results\\n\\n\\n4.1 Faculty and Publication Data\\n\\nAs shown in Table 2, faculty size varies substantially by organizational type.\\nComputer units have the largest faculties on average (mean 39.2; median 36.0).\\nInformation units are next (mean 28.2; median 22.0), followed by Communication (mean 18.3; median 20.0) and Education (mean 12.6; median 11.0).\\nArt&Science units are the smallest (mean 10.6; median 9.0).\\n\\n\\nPublication output also differs greatly across school types.\\nComputer exhibits the highest per-faculty productivity (mean 25.9; median 16.0; std 28.3).\\nInformation has the greatest total output (sum 8,837) with moderate per-faculty rates (mean 15.7; median 8.0; std 18.0).\\nCommunication shows mid-range rates (mean 14.2; median 9.0; std 15.8).\\nArt&Science and Education display lower per-faculty publication rates (means 10.6 and 10.9, respectively).\\n\\n\\nTable 2: Publications and Faculty Statistics by Academic Structure Type\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPublications (per faculty)\\nFaculty (per unit)\\n\\n\\nType\\nSum\\nMean\\nMedian\\nStd\\nSum\\nMean\\nMedian\\nStd\\n\\n\\nArt&Science\\n564\\n10.6\\n6.0\\n10.2\\n53\\n10.6\\n9.0\\n3.7\\n\\n\\nCommunication\\n1820\\n14.2\\n9.0\\n15.8\\n128\\n18.3\\n20.0\\n5.9\\n\\n\\nComputer\\n5068\\n25.9\\n16.0\\n28.3\\n196\\n39.2\\n36.0\\n19.2\\n\\n\\nEducation\\n957\\n10.9\\n6.0\\n11.8\\n88\\n12.6\\n11.0\\n6.9\\n\\n\\nInformation\\n8837\\n15.7\\n8.0\\n18.0\\n563\\n28.2\\n22.0\\n19.2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.2 Research Themes\\n\\nTo address RQ1 regarding the intellectual structure and foundational dimensions of the field, we first analyze the research themes emerging from publications. Our theme modeling analysis of 14,705 LIS faculty publications between 2013 and 2024 reveals the interdisciplinary nature of Library and Information Science research in the United States. The model identified 16 distinct research themes as shown in Table 3 and Figure 2. The table shows the label, count, and representation of each theme. The labels were generated by the GPT-4o using the publication title in each theme and adjusted by the authors. The representation is a list of keywords that are most representative of the theme detected by the c-TF-IDF algorithm. The subtopics of each research theme were identified by the GPT-4.1 based system. The count is the number of publications in the theme. The research landscape map (Figure 2) shows the distribution of publications in the 16 themes encoded by different colors. The landscape map provides an intuitive overview of the proximity and boundaries between different research themes in LIS.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: Research landscape of Library and Information Science in the United States from 2013 to 2024. Each point is a publication positioned by semantic similarity. Colors denote the 16 research themes; dense regions and larger labels mark higher volume. Neighboring clusters indicate intellectual proximity.\\n\\n\\nDrawing on the landscape visualization, topic modeling results, representative publications, and the field\\u2019s inherent interdisciplinarity, we identify three research dimensions that constitute the main pillars of LIS.\\nThese dimensions offer a higher-granularity framework for characterizing research interests and research portfolios across the field.\\nWe organize the dimensions and their constituent themes as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nLibrary and Knowledge Organization: Library Science, Metadata and Archives, Scholarly Communication\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nHuman-Centered Technology: Health Informatics and Technology, Social Media, Human-Computer Interaction, Digital Privacy and Well-Being, Computing Education, Health Information Behavior, Information Access and Equity, Extended Reality\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nComputing Systems: Biomedical Informatics, AI and Data Science, Cybersecurity, Information Retrieval, Autonomous Systems\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn Figure 2, traditional LIS sits at the top center with \\u201cLibrary Science\\u201d adjacent to \\u201cMetadata and Archives\\u201d and \\u201cScholarly Communication,\\u201d forming a coherent Library and Knowledge Organization dimension. To the right-center is the Human-Centered Technology dimension, including \\u201cHuman-Computer Interaction,\\u201d \\u201cDigital Privacy and Well-Being,\\u201d \\u201cInformation Access and Equity,\\u201d \\u201cComputing Education,\\u201d and \\u201cSocial Media.\\u201d This dimension also encompasses \\u201cExtended Reality\\u201d and health-related themes (\\u201cHealth Informatics and Technology\\u201d and \\u201cHealth Information Behavior\\u201d), which cluster in connected regions. Computing Systems dimension, occupying the lower-right and technical fronts, includes \\u201cCybersecurity,\\u201d \\u201cAutonomous Systems,\\u201d \\u201cInformation Retrieval,\\u201d \\u201cBiomedical Informatics,\\u201d and \\u201cAI and Data Science.\\u201d\\n\\n\\nLibrary and Information Science is upheld by the three foundational research groups:\\nLibrary and Knowledge Organization is the discipline\\u2019s heritage and focuses on ensuring knowledge is systematically described, curated, and made discoverable;\\nHuman-Centered Technology keeps the field rooted in people\\u2019s information needs and societal impact, guiding the ethical and inclusive design and use of technologies; and\\nComputing Systems pushes the frontier by developing the algorithms, data infrastructures, and intelligent systems that enable large-scale information access and analysis.\\nTogether these dimensions balance information, human values, and technical innovation, defining the holistic scope of LIS [Saracevic1999, Bates1999, olson2009timelines, Dillon2012, bawden2022introduction].\\n\\n\\nTable 3: The 16 Research Themes Identified in LIS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLabel\\n\\n\\nCount\\n\\n\\nRepresentation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubtopics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\nLibrary Science\\n\\n\\n1593\\n\\n\\nlibrary, librarians, services, literacy, collections, community, education, outreach, policy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLibraries, Librarianship, Information services, and Education\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\nBiomedical Informatics\\n\\n\\n1275\\n\\n\\nbiomedical, ontology, protein, genes, diseases, clinical, semantic, drugs, trials\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBiomedical text mining, Ontologies, Clinical informatics, and Drug discovery\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\nAI and Data Science\\n\\n\\n1255\\n\\n\\nai, machine learning, data, visualization, graphs, modeling, networks, prediction, analytics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMachine learning, Data visualization, Network science, and Predictive analytics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\nMetadata and Archives\\n\\n\\n1231\\n\\n\\nmetadata, archival, curation, preservation, provenance, collections, standards, repositories, reuse\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDigital libraries, Curation, Preservation, and Metadata standards\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\nHealth Informatics and Technology\\n\\n\\n1100\\n\\n\\nhealth, clinicians, caregivers, telehealth, mhealth, devices, interventions, aging, patients\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTelehealth, mHealth, Aging and caregiving, and Health IT design\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\nSocial Media\\n\\n\\n1029\\n\\n\\nsocial media, misinformation, platforms, tweets, facebook, covid, public, news, communities\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSocial media, Misinformation, Online communities, and Credibility\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\nHuman-Computer Interaction\\n\\n\\n987\\n\\n\\nhci, design, usability, participation, accessibility, users, experiences, games, inclusion\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHuman-centered design, Accessibility, Inclusive design, and User experience\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\nDigital Privacy and Well-Being\\n\\n\\n903\\n\\n\\nprivacy, online safety, harassment, well-being, youth, consent, surveillance, policy, ethics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrivacy, Online safety, Digital well-being, and Policy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\nComputing Education\\n\\n\\n818\\n\\n\\nstudents, programming, curriculum, learning, assessment, cs education, analytics, diversity, pedagogy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCS education, Data science curriculum, Diversity, and Learning analytics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\nCybersecurity\\n\\n\\n806\\n\\n\\ncybersecurity, threats, cloud, iot, attacks, detection, blockchain, edge, resilience\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCybersecurity, IoT security, Cloud security, and Threat detection\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\nInformation Retrieval\\n\\n\\n790\\n\\n\\nretrieval, search, queries, relevance, recommendation, ranking, evaluation, user behavior, web\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSearch systems, Recommender systems, Evaluation, and User engagement\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\nHealth Information Behavior\\n\\n\\n657\\n\\n\\nhealth, information seeking, patients, vaccines, misinformation, behaviors, communities, support, public\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHealth information seeking, Vaccination, Public health communication, and Misinformation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\nInformation Access and Equity\\n\\n\\n651\\n\\n\\naccess, equity, digital divide, inclusion, libraries, underserved, community, justice, policy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInformation equity, Access policy, Digital inclusion, and Community engagement\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\nScholarly Communication\\n\\n\\n604\\n\\n\\ncitations, journals, publications, impact, open access, authorship, disciplines, science, metrics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScientometrics, Research evaluation, Collaboration, and Open science\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\nExtended Reality\\n\\n\\n514\\n\\n\\nvr, ar, xr, accessibility, blind, interaction, haptics, children, learning\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXR/VR/AR, Assistive technology, Interaction techniques, and Inclusive design\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\nAutonomous Systems\\n\\n\\n454\\n\\n\\nrobots, trust, autonomy, human-robot interaction, vehicles, agents, transparency, teamwork, safety\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHuman-robot interaction, Trust, Autonomous vehicles, and Agent-based systems\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 3: Publication trends across LIS research themes from 2014 to 2023.

Human\\u2013Computer Interaction exhibits modest growth (n=3.3%n{=}3.3\\\\%), maintaining relatively stable output levels.\\nTraditional foundational areas demonstrate slower but consistent growth patterns: Library Science (n=2.3%n{=}2.3\\\\%), Cybersecurity (n=2.1%n{=}2.1\\\\%), Library and Knowledge Organization (n=1.5%n{=}1.5\\\\%), Scholarly Communication (n=1.0%n{=}1.0\\\\%), and Metadata and Archives (n=0.6%n{=}0.6\\\\%), though Information Retrieval shows a slight decline (n=\\u22122.4%n{=-}2.4\\\\%) and Information Access and Equity experiences modest contraction (n=\\u22121.2%n{=-}1.2\\\\%).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3 Organizational Structure and Research Profiles\\n\\nTurning to RQ2, this section examines how these research themes are distributed across different organizational types to understand the relationship between structure and scholarship.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3.1 Distributional Patterns\\n\\nThe relationship between organizational structure and research focus reveals distinct specialization patterns across different academic organizational structures (Figure 4).\\nAs illustrated in the stacked bar chart, each organizational type exhibits a unique research profile, with clear variations in the proportion of research themes.\\n\\n\\nFigure 4: Distribution of research themes across different types of LIS schools. This visualization reveals how organizational positioning influences research focus, with clear specialization patterns emerging across different school types.\\n\\n\\nEducation schools demonstrate the strongest commitment to traditional library-oriented research, with Library Science constituting 30.8% of their publications.\\nMetadata and Archives represent another substantial focus area at 19.8%, reinforcing their dedication to information organization and preservation.\\nThese schools also devote considerable attention to Computing Education (8.6%), indicating the education-oriented research focus of the Education schools.\\n\\n\\nComputer schools present the most technically oriented research profile among all organizational types.\\nTheir focus on Biomedical Informatics (15.9%) and Privacy and Security (10.1%) significantly exceeds the LIS-wide averages, reflecting deep engagement with computational methods and data-intensive research domains.\\nNotably, Library Science accounts for merely 2.7% of their research output, representing the lowest proportion among all structural types and a fundamental shift toward technology-driven research.\\n\\n\\nCommunication schools maintain a more balanced research agenda that bridges traditional and emerging information concerns.\\nLibrary Science remains prominent at 26.8%, while Metadata and Archives (8.3%), Social Media research (8.0%), and Information Access and Equity (7.5%) constitute additional focal areas.\\nThis distribution suggests a research orientation that encompasses both institutional information practices and social dimensions of information phenomena.\\n\\n\\nArt&Science schools display similar research emphases as Communication schools. They demonstrate engagement with both traditional information science concerns and data-intensive research domains.\\nLibrary Science comprises 23.8% of their work, while Information Retrieval (13.1%) and Health Information Behavior (12.1%) feature prominently.\\n\\n\\nIndependent Information schools exhibit the most diversified research portfolio, with no single theme dominating their scholarly output.\\nTheir research spans multiple domains relatively evenly, though AI and Data Science (10.6%) emerges as areas of particular concentration.\\nThis balanced distribution suggests that Information schools cultivate broad interdisciplinary connections. Worth noting is that since the majority of the schools are Information schools, it is not surprising they present more diverse research profiles.\\n\\n\\nThe visual comparison across organizational types in Figure 4 reveals how structural positioning fundamentally shapes research agendas.\\nComputer schools clearly drive technical specializations, Education schools sustain traditional library science while incorporating education technologies, and Communication and Art&Science schools foster research on information behavior and social media.\\n\\n\\nTo statistically validate these observed differences, we performed a PERMANOVA using Aitchison distance. The global test revealed a statistically significant difference in research topic composition across the five school types (pseudo-F=1.77F=1.77, p=0.002p=0.002). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons using Fisher\\u2019s Protected LSD indicated that Computer Science-affiliated schools differ significantly from Education (p=0.001p=0.001), Information (p=0.003p=0.003), Communication (p=0.008p=0.008), and Art & Science (p=0.037p=0.037) schools. Additionally, Information schools significantly differ from Education schools (p=0.036p=0.036). Other pairwise comparisons were not statistically significant (p>0.05p>0.05). These results confirm that the \\u201cComputer\\u201d affiliation marks a distinct departure in research identity, while subtle differences also exist between other types of schools.\\n\\n\\nThese patterns observed from the visualization along with the statistical evidence demonstrate that organizational structure serves not merely as an administrative arrangement but as a powerful force shaping the intellectual direction of LIS scholarship.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3.2 Individual School Positioning\\n\\nSince schools of the same type may exhibit substantial variation, we further examine each university\\u2019s research positioning by analyzing the similarity between its publications and those of other institutions.\\nThe university positioning visualization (Figure 5) illustrates how individual institutions situate themselves within the broader research landscape through principal component analysis (PCA).\\nWe employ PCA because its linear nature enables meaningful comparisons of proximity across institutions.\\nThe visualization reveals several notable patterns in the research landscape.\\n\\n\\nFigure 5: Positioning of LIS schools in the research landscape. Each node represents a university, with node color indicating academic structure type. Proximity between institutions reflects similarity in research profiles, revealing clusters of schools with shared research emphases.\\n\\n\\nFirst, Computer schools (shown in green) form a distinct cluster on the right side of the plot, indicating their shared emphasis on computational and technical research areas.\\nSecond, Information schools (shown in blue) form the largest and most dispersed cluster, which reflects their diverse research portfolios spanning both traditional and emerging information science topics.\\nThird, schools from different organizational types cluster together too, suggesting that research focus can transcend structural boundaries. For instance, several Education schools position near Communication schools.\\nFourth, considerable within-type variation exists, demonstrating that organizational structure alone does not determine research direction. For example, University of California\\u2013Los Angeles and Long Island University Post are both Education schools but they are located in different parts of the plot. These patterns reveal that while organizational structure influences research priorities, other factors such as individual institutional cultures, faculty expertise, and strategic choices may also play important roles in shaping research identities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.4 Temporal Evolution and Bidirectional Movement\\n\\nFinally, to answer RQ3 about the evolution of research priorities and the influence of organizational type, we trace the trajectories of schools and school types over the 12-year period.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.4.1 Directional Shifts\\n\\nFigure 6 presents the aggregate temporal evolution (linear regression with 95% confidence interval) of research priorities across the five organizational types of LIS schools. Each arrow represents a school type\\u2019s collective trajectory within the research landscape defined by the three foundational dimensions. Computer schools exhibit a clear shift toward HCT and away from CS research, with slight movement away from LKO and relatively low uncertainty in their trajectories. Information schools also moved toward HCT and CS while retreating from LKO. Communication and Art&Science schools follow similar trajectories to Information schools, though Art&Science schools demonstrate stronger movement toward CS. Education schools display a unique evolutionary pattern, moving toward LKO and CS while shifting away from HCT. While these aggregate patterns reveal meaningful differences across organizational types, substantial heterogeneity exists within each category. Thus, we also examined individual school trajectories.\\n\\n\\nFigure 6: Temporal evolution of research priorities for five types of LIS schools from 2013 to 2024 using ternary plots. Each arrow represents an institution\\u2019s trajectory within the research landscape defined by three foundational dimensions. The band shows 95% confidence interval. The three vertices of each triangle represent 100% concentration in HCT, LKO, and CS, respectively.\\n\\n\\nSimilarly, Figure 7 visualizes the temporal evolution of research priorities for 37 LIS schools from 2013 to 2024 using ternary plots. Each arrow represents a school\\u2019s trajectory within the research landscape defined by three foundational dimensions. The percentage changes in research dimension shares of the schools can be found in Appendix.\\n\\n\\nFigure 7: Ternary plots depicting the directional shifts of LIS schools across three research dimensions from 2013 to 2024. Each of the six panels represents schools exhibiting a specific movement pattern. Each school is represented by an arrow connecting its starting position to its ending position, with colors indicating organizational structure type.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe most profound shift is a migration away from LKO. Panel a2 (Moving Away from LKO) captures the largest grouping, comprising 21 schools (56.8% of the sample) that reduced their relative focus on LKO. This migration spans all organizational types, with arrows originating near the LKO vertex and extending toward the HCT-CS axis, confirming the narrative of a fundamental transition in LIS research. However, the data challenges the assumption of a unidirectional drift. Panel a1 (Moving Toward LKO) reveals a counter-trend, where 14 schools increased their relative focus on LKO. Many of these institutions, already heavily invested in HCT and CS, appear to be re-balancing their portfolios by renewing their engagement with traditional library and information science foundations.\\nPanel b1 (Moving Toward HCT) highlights another primary trend: 19 schools shifting their portfolios toward Human-Centered Technology. This group largely overlaps with those moving away from LKO (Panel a2). Notably, many arrows in this panel are long and terminate near the HCT vertex, suggesting a radical transformation toward HCT rather than a subtle adjustment.\\n\\n\\nPanel c1 (Moving Toward CS) shows a smaller but significant cluster of 14 schools deepening their engagement with CS. Conversely, Panel c2 (Moving Away from CS) shows 11 schools retreating from CS research. These counter-movements are particularly visible among Computer-affiliated schools and schools with heavy investments in CS, which were among the most CS-focused in 2013. This suggests that even computationally intensive schools are seeking more balanced research portfolios.\\n\\n\\nIn summary, the evolution of LIS research is characterized not by a uniform technological drift, but by a complex dynamic of diversification and strategic re-balancing between human-centered, computational, and traditional information priorities. However, it is unclear the strategy of schools moving away and toward different dimensions. Thus, we analyze the pattern combinations of directional shifts to better understand the strategies in the next section.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.4.2 Pattern Combinations\\n\\nAnalysis of how directional movements combine reveals that LIS schools are following diverse evolutionary strategies (Figure 8). The most common pattern is moving Away from LKO. The pattern combined with Toward HCT (16 schools, 43.2%) and Toward CS (10 schools, 27.0%) form the most common evolutionary strategies in LIS. Within this broad trend of distancing from traditional foundations (LKO), a subgroup of 5 schools (13.5%) pursues a \\u201cDual-Diversification\\u201d strategy, simultaneously moving Away from LKO while expanding into both HCT and CS.\\n\\n\\nFigure 8: UpSet plot showing the distribution of schools across different research trend patterns within the three research dimensions.\\nThe horizontal bar chart (left) displays the size of each trend category, while the vertical bar chart (top) shows the composition of intersections by school types.\\nThe dot matrix (bottom right) indicates which trend patterns are combined in each intersection, with connected dots representing combinations.\\nTrend categories include movements toward or away from LKO, HCT, and CS.\\n\\n\\nIn contrast, two other primary evolutionary strategies involve a renewed emphasis on LKO: Away from CS + Toward LKO and Away from HCT + Toward LKO (both 8 schools, 21.6%). These patterns represent distinct pathways for schools re-engaging with LKO. Other salient strategies include Away from HCT + Toward CS (6 schools, 16.2%) and Away from CS + Toward HCT (5 schools, 13.5%). These disparate trajectories underscore that LIS schools are not undergoing a uniform transformation, but rather differentiating into specialized profiles through targeted strategic shifts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"5 Discussion\": \"\\n\\n5 Discussion\\n\\nThe Diversification of LIS and the Question of Disciplinary Coherence\\n\\nOur finding that LIS schools pursue concentrated yet divergent evolutionary strategies speaks directly to longstanding debates about disciplinary coherence and fragmentation [Bawden2008, Cronin2005]. Previous scholarship has expressed concern that LIS risks developing into disconnected subfields as schools pursue computational, social, or traditional library-focused research without shared intellectual foundations [Furner2015]. Our evidence suggests a more nuanced reality: while schools do specialize along distinct dimensions, they do so through systematic patterns rather than chaotic fragmentation. The bifurcation between Human-Centered Technology and Computing Systems pathways among schools leaving traditional LIS may reflect what [whitley2000intellectual] described as the \\u201corganizational fragmentation\\u201d typical of fields with high task uncertainty and low mutual dependence [vakkari2024characterizes, astrom2008formalizing]\\u2014multiple viable approaches exist to studying information phenomena, and schools choose based on resource dependencies and institutional contexts rather than a single disciplinary logic.\\n\\n\\nHowever, the persistence of Library and Knowledge Organization research across all organizational types, combined with the substantial \\u201creturn to foundations\\u201d pattern, challenges declinate narratives. This pattern aligns with [lou2021temporally] observation that information organization remains conceptually central even as methods evolve. The question is not whether LIS will survive computational transformation, but rather how effectively the field integrates new capabilities while preserving distinctive expertise that other disciplines cannot easily replicate.\\n\\n\\n\\nOrganizational Embeddedness and Research Autonomy\\n\\nThe asymmetric clustering patterns we observed\\u2014particularly the tight convergence of Computer schools versus the dispersion of independent Information schools\\u2014can be understood through resource dependence theory [Salancik1978]. Schools partnering with powerful disciplines like computer science gain access to infrastructure, funding networks, and legitimacy, but these benefits come with constraints on research autonomy. Our finding that Computer schools cluster tightly in computationally-intensive research space suggests that resource dependencies shape not just what research is feasible, but what research becomes normative within those institutional contexts.\\n\\n\\nYet resource dependence alone cannot explain our temporal findings. The observation that over half of Computer schools moved away from pure Computing Systems research (while maintaining computational orientation in other dimensions) suggests schools exercise agency in navigating structural constraints. This aligns with recent organizational scholarship emphasizing that embedded actors can strategically decouple from institutional pressures [glaser2018changing]. Computer schools may satisfy Computer Science partnership expectations through faculty hiring and infrastructure sharing while carving out distinctive research niches in computational social science or health informatics that differentiate them from generic Computer Science departments.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Human-Centered Technology Ascendancy\\n\\nPerhaps our most striking finding is that Human-Centered Technology, not Computing Systems, emerged as LIS\\u2019s dominant growth vector. This pattern contradicts conventional wisdom equating \\u201cdata science\\u201d with computational methods broadly, and challenges assumptions that LIS schools must compete with Computer Science departments on systems research to remain relevant. We propose three complementary explanations for HCT\\u2019s prominence. First, path dependence: LIS\\u2019s historical emphasis on user-centered librarianship and information behavior research provides intellectual and methodological foundations that translate more readily into human-computer interaction, social computing, and digital privacy research than into algorithms or systems architecture. Schools building on existing strengths may achieve higher quality output than those attempting to compete in areas where they lack comparative advantage. Second, labor market differentiation: As Computer Science departments flood markets with systems-oriented graduates, LIS programs may find better placement outcomes by preparing graduates who combine technical competence with deep understanding of human information needs\\u2014a skill combination Computer Science programs rarely emphasize. Student demand follows employment opportunities, creating feedback loops that reinforce HCT investment. Third, funding landscape evolution: Major funding agencies increasingly prioritize \\u201csocially-relevant computing\\u201d and \\u201chuman-AI interaction\\u201d over pure systems research (NSF\\u2019s focus on \\u201cAI for Social Good\\u201d, NIH\\u2019s emphasis on human-centered health IT) [tomavsev2020ai, NIH2025]. LIS schools may be responding rationally to these incentive structures.\\n\\n\\n\\nImplications for LIS Education and Accreditation\\n\\nOur findings raise challenges for accreditation bodies and professional organizations assuming uniform standards across organizationally diverse schools. If Computer schools produce 25.9 publications per faculty member focused heavily on computational methods while Education schools produce 10.9 publications per faculty emphasizing information literacy and pedagogy, can a single set of accreditation standards meaningfully assess both? Current ALA accreditation focuses on professional competencies rather than research profiles, but faculty expertise necessarily shapes what students learn.[salaba202321st]\\nThe field faces a choice: embrace organizational diversity by developing multiple accreditation pathways recognizing different institutional missions, or insist on core competencies that all graduates must demonstrate regardless of school type. The former risks fragmentation and loss of professional identity; the latter may impose unrealistic expectations on schools with limited resources.\\n\\n\\n\\nLimitations and Future Directions\\n\\nOur descriptive analysis documents co-occurrence patterns but cannot establish whether organizational structure shapes research, research drives structural choices, or both co-evolve. Our U.S.-focused sample may not generalize internationally, and publication-based measures exclude teaching, service, and professional impact. Future research should examine mechanisms linking structure to research: Do Computer Science partnerships influence outcomes through hiring, infrastructure, or disciplinary norms? Do different structures produce graduates with distinct competencies and career outcomes? Longitudinal case studies of reorganization events could provide causal insights our cross-sectional approach cannot.\\n\\n\\n\", \"6 Conclusion\": \"\\n\\n6 Conclusion\\n\\nThis study provides the first comprehensive empirical mapping of how organizational structures and research portfolios co-occur across U.S. Library and Information Science schools. By analyzing 14,705 publications from 1,264 faculty members across 44 institutions, we have established a research landscape framework organized around three foundational dimensions that offers a shared vocabulary for understanding LIS\\u2019s intellectual diversity. Our findings reveal that organizational positioning shapes but does not determine research trajectories: Computer schools cluster tightly in computationally-intensive research, yet most are pivoting toward Human-Centered Technology and Library and Knowledge Organization; independent Information schools demonstrate the greatest portfolio diversity; and Education schools uniquely maintain engagement with traditional library science foundations. Most significantly, the temporal analysis reveals that LIS schools pursue a small number of coherent strategic pathways, with Human-Centered Technology instead of Computing Systems emerging as the field\\u2019s primary growth vector. The intellectual diversity documented here may represent adaptive capacity rather than fragmentation, positioning different schools to serve distinct research profiles and to respond to varied institutional demands. The question facing LIS is whether this diversity will be deliberately cultivated as a source of collective strength or whether competitive pressures will force convergence.\\n\\n\", \"7 Data Availability Statement\": \"\\n\\n7 Data Availability Statement\\n\\nThe faculty data can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18396782.

These mobile robotic systems are increasingly utilized in diverse domains such as agriculture, logistics, surveillance, environmental monitoring, and search and rescue operations. As these robots operate in complex, dynamic, and often unpredictable environments, there is a growing need to enhance their autonomy to perform tasks with higher accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability.\\n\\n\\nOne of the critical factors in achieving greater autonomy in mobile robotic systems is the effective use of knowledge. Mobile robots require comprehensive and precise knowledge about their environment, tasks, actions, and inherent capabilities to make informed decisions and execute tasks successfully across different contexts. Traditionally, this knowledge has been encoded in algorithms and static databases, which often lack the flexibility and scalability needed to handle the dynamic nature of real-world scenarios.\\n\\n\\nTo address these limitations, the concept of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) has emerged as a powerful tool for knowledge representation and reasoning. KGs provide a structured and semantically rich framework for organizing information, enabling both the representation of complex relationships and efficient algorithms for knowledge retrieval and reasoning. Integrating KGs into mobile robot systems can enhance their capability to perform these tasks autonomously by providing real-time situational awareness, contextual understanding, and decision support.\\n\\n\\nDespite these advantages, the development and implementation of KGs in mobile robotic systems present several challenges, including data integration from various sensors and sources, real-time knowledge updating, or multi-agent interaction.\\n\\n\\nThis paper aims to develop a comprehensive methodology for applying KG to existing ROS 2 based robotic systems using a \\u201dbrownfield\\u201d approach. Our goal is to enhance the explainability of the robot\\u2019s operations during various stages and to leverage this knowledge for informed decision-making processes.\\n\\n\\nTo this end, we provide the following contributions:\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nA detailed description of each step of the methodology, specifying the required inputs and the process to achieve the desired outputs to ensure clarity and precision in executing each phase effectively.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nSoftware tools to apply the described methodology to any ROS 2 based robotic system.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nA working example describing the application of the proposed methodology to Aerostack2 [2], a ROS 2 open-source framework to design and control aerial robotic systems.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI-A Related work\\n\\n\\nMobile robotic systems have seen significant advancements with the integration of knowledge-based systems, which enhance their decision-making and adaptability in dynamic environments. Various approaches have been explored in this domain, each one leveraging distinct methodologies and technologies to improve robotic autonomy and efficiency. This section delves into the diverse landscape of mobile robotic systems incorporating knowledge-based systems, highlighting key innovations, methodologies, and their respective contributions to the field.\\n\\n\\nCognitive architectures are comprehensive, computational frameworks designed to model the structures and processes of human cognition. These architectures serve as blueprints for understanding and replicating the intricacies of human thought, encompassing perception, memory, reasoning, and learning. They provide a unified platform for developing intelligent agents capable of performing complex tasks, offering significant advancements in fields ranging from robotics to human-computer interaction.\\n\\n\\nSOAR [4], was the first cognitive architecture integrated into real robots and used with multiple robots [1]. Its basic architecture is established by representing the state of an environment through a graph composed of discrete objects and continuous properties. This allows for a set of predicates to be independent and fixed within the architecture, while the decisions regarding which predicates should be extracted are determined by the specific task that an agent must perform [5].\\n\\n\\nACT-R [8] models human cognition by integrating symbolic and subsymbolic processing. Symbolic processing includes declarative memory, which stores knowledge as chunks (data and facts) with labels (slots), and procedural memory, which holds production rules in \\u201dif-then\\u201d statements to guide behavior based on current goals. Subsymbolic processing operates using a connectionist model, resolving conflicts by selecting the chunk with the highest activation level, determined by past utility and context relevance. Through cycles of perception, cognition, and action, ACT-R adapts to changing environments and tasks, effectively storing and managing knowledge.\\n\\n\\nLIDA [3], provides adaptation and continuous learning by utilizing a multilayer working memory system. Each layer within this system has a distinct purpose and stores various types of information: perceptual, declarative, memory, and procedural. Active working memory serves as the interface that connects all these layers, allowing for the manipulation of stored information. LIDA employs a distributed representation where information is encoded through the activation patterns of artificial neural networks, offering a robust mechanism for adapting to dynamic environments.\\n\\n\\nAside from cognitive architectures, other systems focus more specifically on concrete knowledge representation methods. These methods, used in modern advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and neural networks, often emphasize structured data storage, pattern recognition, and internal learned representations.\\n\\n\\nThe proposed ontology structure by [9] comprises three hierarchical layers where each layer regards more specific knowledge than the former: a metaontology that represents generic concepts, an ontology schema defining domain-specific knowledge, and an ontology instance that captures specific information about individual objects and their attributes. These layers are organized into six classes: Feature, Object, Actor, Space, Context, and Action, each with varying levels of detail. This structure provides a comprehensive, object-oriented, and frame-based language while the hierarchical structure that allows for knowledge to be effectively used through reasoning.\\n\\n\\nThe system proposed in [6] utilizes a knowledge-based system that integrates explicit expert knowledge with implicit learned knowledge, allowing the system to update its model based on the acquired information continuously. Through a knowledge acquisition module explicit knowledge provided by the operator is captured and converted into machine-readable form and then integrated with implicit knowledge. Implicit knowledge is captured by training a model to imitate the adjustments made by the operator, ultimately leading to full automation of robot programming. By learning from the operator\\u2019s adjustments, the system enhances its flexibility, adaptability, and performance, addressing the challenges of industrial robot programming and improving overall efficiency in production processes.\\n\\n\\nKnowledge Graphs (KG) were first introduced in [10] and later popularized by Google, and have evolved significantly, becoming powerful tools for structuring and managing complex relationships between data in various fields, including autonomous systems and robotics. In [7], authors discuss the use of KGs in enhancing robot manipulation tasks. They introduce a multi-layer knowledge-representation model that incorporates various elements such as scenes, objects, agents, tasks, actions, and skills. This hierarchical structure allows for a more nuanced understanding of manipulation tasks compared to traditional flat representations. The authors propose a heterogeneous graph-embedding method that assigns different weights to various relations within the KG to enhance reasoning capabilities. This approach allows the system to differentiate the significance of different connections, facilitating more nuanced reasoning about how various factors influence manipulation tasks.\\n\\n\\nCompared to traditional cognitive architectures, KGs offer a more flexible and scalable approach to representing information. While cognitive architectures are highly specialized in replicating human-like reasoning and learning, they are limited in adaptability across various tasks or domains. KGs, in contrast, provide a dynamic, interconnected representation of entities and their relationships, allowing for more granular, real-time information querying and updating.\\n\\n\\n\", \"II METHODOLOGY\": \"\\n\\nII METHODOLOGY\\n\\n\\nFigure 1: A full overview of the described methodology. Circles represent each step described in the proposed methodology while rectangular boxes contain the outcomes of each step.\\n\\n\\nThe proposed methodology\\u2019s objective is to integrate KGs into ROS 2 systems providing a structured approach for leveraging the full potential of KGs, thus enabling more informed decision-making and improved mission performance in diverse ROS 2 based applications. This methodology is composed of several key steps: defining initial and target conditions, structuring tasks and sub-tasks, planning their sequence, representing task-related data in a KG, and designing the mission using a high-level language. Each step builds on the previous one, ensuring a cohesive process from initial setup to final execution. A full overview of the methodology is shown in Figure 1.\\n\\n\\n\\nII-A Definition\\n\\n\\nIn the definition step, initial conditions of the mission and expected outcomes are defined. This foundational step involves a thorough understanding of the mission\\u2019s goals and constraints, providing a clear vision of the desired outcomes. This step aims to establish a baseline against which the subsequent steps will be measured, ensuring that all efforts align with the ultimate mission objectives.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII-B Structuring\\n\\n\\nThe structuring step involves breaking down the mission into a detailed list of tasks necessary to achieve the defined target conditions. Each task is further subdivided into sub-tasks, with a focus on identifying and specifying the inputs and outputs associated with each sub-task, helping to understand essential activities, their interconnections, and decision points necessary for mission success. These inputs and outputs form the foundational elements necessary for a robust mission and will be mapped to the KG in a later step.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII-C Planning\\n\\n\\nOnce the tasks and sub-tasks are defined, the planning step requires establishing a valid sub-tasks ordering. This ordering should reflect a logical sequence that ensures all prerequisites are met before moving on to subsequent tasks. The primary goal in this step is to verify that the proposed sequence will effectively lead to the achievement of the mission\\u2019s target conditions as outlined in the definition step. A well-ordered plan serves as a roadmap for the subsequent stages, facilitating smooth execution and integration.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII-D Representation\\n\\n\\nThe representation step involves mapping the inputs and outputs of each sub-task to a KG representation. This step is critical for translating the relevant data identified through the task list into a form that can be effectively utilized within the KG framework. By aligning the inputs and outputs with the KG, it is ensured that the necessary information is available and properly organized for efficient querying and control.\\n\\n\\n\\nII-D1 Knowledge Extraction\\n\\nTo apply this methodology to any given ROS 2 based system, it is essential to design a data extraction method tailored to the system\\u2019s specific architecture, data sources and domain ensuring accurate and efficient information retrieval.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII-D2 Concept Design\\n\\nDuring the concept design step, the designer should define how the data will be represented as distinct entities and identify the relationships that connect these entities in the KG. Accurately mapping the data to the KG is essential to ensure that the KG properly represents the system\\u2019s components and their interactions. This alignment is crucial for the system\\u2019s decisions and actions to be consistent with its overall goals.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII-D3 Knowledge Mapping\\n\\nIn this phase, mechanisms are developed to transform raw data into a structured format compliant with the entities and relationships defined in the concept design stage. Given that the methodology is designed to be applied to any ROS 2 system, it is essential to customize these mechanisms to fit the specific system in use.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII-E Mission Design\\n\\n\\nWith the KG structure established, a high-level language is used to specify the mission during this step, including detailed control sequences and queries to interact with the KG. This enables the robot to execute the mission autonomously, with continuous mapping of inputs and outputs to the KG to adapt to changes and make informed decisions. Additionally, during this step, the designer should validate that the specified mission produces the outcomes defined in the definition step.\\n\\n\\n\", \"III ROS 2 KG Implementation\": \"\\n\\nIII ROS 2 KG Implementation\\n\\n\\nOne of the most relevant parts of the methodology is the representation step, which involves the knowledge representation within the KG. To deal with the issues that arise from the handling of knowledge, we have developed different ROS 2 modules that can be used to integrate knowledge graphs into an existing ROS 2 based system. These modules fulfill three main functions:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nKnowledge Base: A ROS 2 node that is in charge of storing the KG data. This node allows for inserting, querying, and deleting both nodes in the KG and edges between them. Additionally, these KG nodes can also store numerical values in terms of properties, which can be quite useful in the robotics domain.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nKnowledge Extractors: These components are different ROS 2 nodes in charge of interfacing with the current robotic system to be able to extract the relevant knowledge to be added to the KG. Those ROS 2 nodes subscribe to the different available topics and process the published data to generate knowledge. Additionally, they also handle data already contained in the KG to generate new knowledge.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\n\\nKnowledge Retrievers: These components allow to query the KG about the entities contained within it and the relationships between them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn terms of software architecture, the knowledge base ROS 2 node centralizes all the information related to the system, while the extractor and retriever ROS 2 nodes interact with it in an N-to-1 fashion during the execution of a given mission.\\n\\n\\nAdditionally, to handle multi-agent missions, the software generates a local KG for each agent and then merges them into a single KG ensuring there are no duplicate entities. This strategy allows each drone to perform independent missions, reducing read and reaction times. For example, when two drones share airspace, the shared KG benefits mission execution by including entities such as the operator\\u2019s position or flight status. Furthermore, the drones can infer new knowledge, such as the relative position between them (e.g., \\u201dclose\\u201d)\\n\\n\", \"IV USE CASE: SEARCH AND RESCUE SCENARIO\": \"\\n\\nIV USE CASE: SEARCH AND RESCUE SCENARIO\\n\\n\\nIn this section, the objective is to test the proposed methodology and the software tools developed during this work in a multi-drone search and rescue mission.\\n\\n\\nThe original robotic system that we will improve using KGs is Aerostack2. Aerostack2 is an open-source software framework designed to create autonomous multi-robot aerial systems. Its modular architecture and multi-robot orientation make it a versatile platform-independent environment capable of addressing a wide range of capabilities for autonomous operation. ROS 2, on the other hand, is an evolution of the popular Robot Operating System (ROS), designed to overcome the limitations of its predecessor. It provides tools, libraries, and conventions for building complex robotic systems and supports multiple programming languages, making it accessible to a wide variety of developers.\\n\\n\\nThe presented use case involves a mission where a set of drones must locate a target in an environment. This mission will be simulated in a Gazebo environment as shown in Figure 2, with the drones autonomously executing the mission using Aerostack2. Knowledge extractors specifically tailored for Aerostack2 will be employed as described in Section III and Figure 3 to enable efficient knowledge handling, integrating the KG capabilities into Aerostack2. This setup will demonstrate how the drones, powered by the advanced knowledge representation and decision-making processes, can effectively carry out the mission in a simulated scenario.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: The Gazebo simulation environment.\\n\\n\\nFigure 3: A graphical view of the application of the methodology to enhance Aerostack2. Green components are the ones introduced to the system through the application of the methodology, while blue ones are related to Aerostack2. Knowledge extraction is allocated in each one of the agents, while the knowledge base and the knowledge retrievers are centralized.\\n\\n\\nDefinition Stage: The mission objective is to inspect a specific area and determine the location of a desired object. The requirements are two drones that can execute autonomous flights, able to perceive their environment, and locate the object of interest. Additionally, the drones must have the capability to continuously monitor the state of their battery and their own location.\\n\\n\\nThis mission aims to evaluate the behavior of the KG both when a single agent knowledge is introduced and when the knowledge expected by multiple agents is integrated into a unified graph. This evaluation will allow us to determine the efficiency and effectiveness of the KG in situations with varying levels of complexity and coordination among multiple autonomous agents.\\n\\n\\nStructuring Stage: The mission can be divided into two main tasks: traversing a defined area and searching for an object, in addition to the tasks responsible for the continuous monitoring of the drones. The full list of identified tasks and sub-tasks is presented in Table I.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTask\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSub-task\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTraverse a defined area\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDetermine the current position of the agent\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCurrent position of each drone\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDetermine the required route to cover the remaining area\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCurrent position of each drone\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRemaining path to cover the area\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSearch and localization of the object\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCapture environmental information\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUse onboard cameras\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRecognize the desired object in the camera image\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCamera image\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLabel the image as contains or does not contain the object\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDrone supervision\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBattery status\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHigh or low level\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelative position between drones\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClose or not close\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMaintain position or move\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNavigation status\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLanded/Flying\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable I: Tasks and sub-tasks identified for the mission consisting of locating a person in an environment.\\n\\n\\nPlanning Stage: Initially, each drone operates independently. The first task is to check its battery status to ensure mission continuity. This check must be performed periodically throughout the mission; if a low battery level is detected, an emergency landing must be carried out if the drone has already taken off, or the takeoff must be prevented if it has not. Additionally, the other drone will take on the responsibility of inspecting the entire area.\\n\\n\\nAfter verifying the battery, the drone will take off and head to its inspection area, where it will start sweeping the zone. If it detects the individual, it will send a signal and wait for the other drone to approach so that they can send the individual\\u2019s coordinates to the operator. Conversely, if the drone does not locate the individual but receives a signal from the other drone, it will halt its trajectory and proceed to the indicated position.\\n\\n\\nFinally, if neither drone locates the individual, both will complete the inspection of their respective areas and return to the origin station, where they will proceed to land.\\n\\n\\nRepresentation Stage:\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nKnowledge Extraction: With the necessary parameters and information for successful mission execution determined by an expert technician, the next step is to extract and maintain this knowledge. Utilizing Aerostack2, we can subscribe to relevant topics like position and battery status, ensuring that these data are continuously updated and readily available for accurate and reliable mission execution.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nConcept Design: The identified entities in the KG are listed in Table II. Since the relevant knowledge to be stored is related to the current state of each drone, the most important edges between are the ones connecting the drone to the person to indicate if it has located the person, those linking a drone to a status entity to describe its current activity, and the edges linking drones to other drones to indicate proximity and avoid collisions.

This involves converting the information into entities and relationships that the graph can support. After completing this step, the KG state in the initial situation defined in the mission is shown in Figure 4.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 4: Initial state of the KG. It represents both drones in their respective home stations, with their batteries highly charged and ready to begin the search and rescue mission.\\n\\n\\nMission Design Stage: The planned mission is translated into Python using the tools provided by Aerostack2 and leveraging the capabilities of the KG to perform queries and monitor the current status of the mission at all times.\\nA rule-based system is used, which analyzes sensitive data through queries and generates consequences. Table IV outlines some examples of queries during the mission.

Figure 5 below shows the knowledge graph when the person has been located.\\n\\n\\nFigure 5: After locating the person, the KG should represent the fact that the two drones are close to each other, that one of them has located the person, and that both of them are still flying.\\n\\n\", \"V CONCLUSIONS\": \"\\n\\nV CONCLUSIONS\\n\\n\\nThe proposed methodology for implementing knowledge graphs in ROS 2 systems offers a robust framework for enhancing knowledge management and decision-making in autonomous missions. By systematically defining, structuring, planning, and representing mission-critical tasks, and by tailoring data extraction methods to specific systems, this approach ensures accurate and efficient integration of knowledge graphs. This integration enables more sophisticated data handling and analysis, ultimately improving the system\\u2019s ability to make informed decisions autonomously. Through this methodology, robotic systems can achieve greater reliability, adaptability, and performance in complex mission scenarios.\\n\\n\\nOne of the primary challenges of the proposed methodology is that it places the responsibility on the user to manually design how perceived information is mapped to nodes and edges in the knowledge graph. This task requires careful consideration of how system data, such as sensor readings or mission status, should be represented in the graph structure. While this approach provides flexibility, it can also be complex and time-consuming, as it requires a deep understanding of both the system and the knowledge graph to ensure accurate and meaningful representation.\\n\\n\\nThe practical application of this methodology is demonstrated through a mission to locate a person using drones, implemented within the Aerostack2 framework. By employing the proposed steps, from defining mission objectives to mapping data onto a knowledge graph, the system was able to effectively coordinate drone operations and enhance situational awareness. The structured representation of tasks and the tailored data extraction facilitated precise control and real-time decision-making. This implementation underscores the methodology\\u2019s potential to improve the operational capabilities of autonomous systems, showcasing its effectiveness in a real-world scenario and highlighting its versatility in handling complex missions within the Aerostack2 framework.\\n\\n\\nFuture work could focus on enhancing the methodology and software components by developing new tools to automate the defined steps, thereby streamlining the entire process. Additionally, incorporating support for reasoning methods beyond rule-based approaches, such as probabilistic or machine learning-based reasoning, could improve decision-making capabilities. Experimenting with different knowledge graph implementations would also be valuable to identify the most efficient solutions for real-time computation, further enhancing the system\\u2019s performance and responsiveness.\\n\\n\"}, \"bibliography\": {\"[1]\": \"\\n[1]\\nD.

In this work, we provide a systematic assessment of the planning and long-horizon reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We propose a novel benchmark based on Sokoban puzzles, intentionally simplified to isolate long-horizon planning from state persistence.

Current methods\u2014whether based on description logics or GNNs\u2014are fundamentally limited by their inability to reason about complex relational compositions (e.g., transitive or compositional relations), which are essential in real-world domains like Logistics, Grid navigation with multi-agent coordination, and hierarchical task planning. Solving this would enable AI agents to learn robust, general policies for complex planning problems that require higher-order relational reasoning. This advancement could catalyze progress in autonomous systems, robotics, and cognitive modeling, where long-horizon, structured decision-making is critical. Moreover, it bridges the gap between symbolic logic and deep learning, fostering hybrid architectures that combine the best of both worlds.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe core challenge lies in balancing **expressive power** and **computational tractability**. While 3-GNNs can capture C3 logic (which supports ternary and compositional relations), they scale poorly\u2014requiring O(n\u00b3) embeddings and O(n\u2074) message-passing time\u2014making them infeasible for large-scale planning. Standard R-GNNs, though efficient, are limited to C2 logic, unable to represent complex relational dependencies such as chained adjacency or nested conditions. Naive approaches like increasing GNN depth or using larger message-passing windows fail because they do not address the underlying logical expressivity gap. Additionally, designing a parameterized mechanism that smoothly transitions from weak to strong approximation of C3 without sacrificing efficiency requires novel architectural innovations and theoretical grounding in finite model theory and descriptive complexity.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrior work has either prioritized expressiveness (e.g., 3-GNNs) at the cost of scalability, or efficiency (e.g., standard R-GNNs) at the cost of expressiveness. There has been no systematic attempt to *parameterize* the level of relational abstraction within a single, unified framework. Existing solutions treat expressiveness and efficiency as opposing goals rather than tunable trade-offs. Furthermore, the lack of benchmarks capable of testing C3-level reasoning in planning tasks has hindered empirical validation. Our approach differs by introducing a *dynamic transformation layer* (At_t(S)) that enriches input representations progressively with higher-order relational features, allowing the model to adaptively increase its logical capacity based on task complexity\u2014offering a continuous spectrum from C2 to C3-like reasoning without fixed cubic overhead.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nWe propose **R-GNN[t]**, a parameterized variant of Relational Graph Neural Networks where the input is transformed via a dynamic feature expansion function At_t(S), which generates higher-order relational atoms (e.g., composed adjacencies, transitive paths) based on a parameter t \u2208 [0, \u221e). At t=0, only first-order atoms are used (C2-level); as t increases, more complex relational structures are introduced, approximating C3 logic. The architecture retains the same message-passing and aggregation mechanisms as standard R-GNNs, ensuring linear-time complexity. We will evaluate on three benchmark domains: (1) Grid navigation with compositional adjacency (Adj1(x,x'), Adj2(y,y')), (2) Logistics with multi-step transport chains, and (3) Blocksworld variants requiring nested goal decomposition. Metrics include success rate, plan length, and logical consistency score (measuring whether learned policies respect compositional constraints). Expected outcomes: R-GNN[t] will outperform standard R-GNNs and 3-GNNs in accuracy on C3-requiring tasks while maintaining near-linear runtime\u2014even for large instances\u2014demonstrating a viable path toward scalable, logically powerful planning agents.\n}", "continue_simulation": true, "communications": [], "total_milestones": 2, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 2}}, {"iteration": 3, "task_assignments": {"agent1": "### **Action: Initiate a \"Team Alignment & Planning Sync\" Session**\n\n**Why this is the optimal next task:**\n1.  **Directly Addresses the Punishment Reminder:** The team's zero communication score is a severe penalty.

It would also empower AI systems to handle long-horizon, multi-step planning tasks with richer relational semantics, enabling real-world applications in robotics, autonomous systems, and intelligent agents operating in structured environments. Furthermore, it would open new pathways for integrating neural and symbolic AI, fostering more interpretable and robust planning systems.\",\n  \n  \"Question 3\": \"The challenge lies in achieving the expressive power of C\u2083 logic (which supports ternary relations and relation composition) while avoiding the cubic memory and quartic time complexity of 3-GNNs. Naive extensions to higher-order GNNs fail due to scalability issues, and existing feature engineering methods (e.g., fixed grammars) lack adaptability to varying problem complexity. Moreover, directly learning complex logical features from raw state atoms is difficult because the signal is sparse and the search space is vast. The core difficulty is balancing expressiveness with efficiency: increasing expressiveness too much leads to intractability, while limiting it prevents modeling essential relational structures. Additionally, training such models requires carefully designed supervision signals and synthetic data that reflect complex logical dependencies, which are not readily available in standard planning benchmarks.\",\n  \n  \"Question 4\": \"Prior work has either used fixed, domain-independent feature grammars (limited to C\u2082 logic) or standard R-GNNs that only model pairwise interactions, both of which cannot express relation composition or higher-order constraints. While 3-GNNs offer the theoretical expressiveness of C\u2083 logic, they are impractical for large-scale planning due to their O(n\u00b3) memory and O(n\u2074) time complexity. Previous attempts to approximate higher-order logic via parameterized message passing (e.g., R-GNN[t]) have not been systematically evaluated or integrated into end-to-end policy learning frameworks. The key barrier has been the lack of a principled, learnable mechanism to control complexity during training and inference. Our approach differs by introducing a learnable, continuous parameter t that controls the depth of relational abstraction in the input transformation layer, allowing the model to adaptively trade off expressiveness and efficiency\u2014something no prior method has achieved in a unified, scalable framework.\",\n  \n  \"Question 5\": \"Our approach introduces R-GNN[t], a parameterized relational GNN where the input is transformed via a learnable function At(S) that generates higher-order relational features based on a parameter t \u2208 [0, \u221e). At t=0, the model behaves like a standard R-GNN (pairwise only); as t increases, it gradually incorporates triplet-level abstractions, approximating 3-GNN behavior. The key components are: (1) A differentiable, learnable transformation layer that generates relational features using a controlled depth of composition (e.g., via recursive message passing up to t hops), (2) A policy network trained end-to-end using reinforcement learning on standard planning benchmarks (e.g., Blocksworld, Grid, Logistics), (3) A complexity-aware training objective that penalizes high t values when performance plateaus, encouraging efficient solutions. We will evaluate on SokoBench, Grid, and Logistics domains, using metrics such as success rate, average plan length, and computational cost (inference time and memory). Expected outcomes include: (i) a model that achieves near-3-GNN performance on relation-composition tasks while using only O(n\u00b2) memory, (ii) a learnable complexity control mechanism that adapts to problem difficulty, and (iii) general policies that generalize across diverse planning domains with complex relational constraints.\"\n}", "continue_simulation": true, "communications": ["In Session db8199d3-2c79-4fb3-98a0-0f07b22d6ed8 \nFrom agent1 to agent2: I propose a 15-minute sync to align on our new research idea.

The idea of integrating policy sketches with structured knowledge graphs from 'Idea2Story' is highly compelling. I believe we can leverage the methodological knowledge graph to encode not just static facts, but also dynamic constraints and transition rules for tasks like Sokoban. This would allow our agent to reason about the problem space more effectively than relying solely on raw text generation.

I'd like to get your feedback on how we can better integrate symbolic planning constraints and policy sketches into the framework, as your expertise in width-based planning and policy sketches is crucial for this.\nFrom agent1 to agent4: I've just reviewed a set of recent papers on automated planning and AI-driven research systems. The findings from 'SokoBench' are particularly striking\u2014large language models struggle with long-horizon planning beyond 25 moves, even in simplified environments. This suggests a fundamental limitation in their internal state representation and sequential reasoning capabilities. I'm currently exploring how policy sketches and knowledge graphs could address these issues by providing structured, reusable frameworks for complex problem decomposition. Would you be interested in discussing potential synergies between our approaches? I believe there's significant overlap in our goals of enhancing planning efficiency and reducing reliance on fragile runtime reasoning.\nFrom agent4 to agent1: Absolutely\u2014your insights from SokoBench are both timely and critical. The failure of LLMs beyond 25 moves underscores a core limitation: they lack *structured, compositional reasoning* with persistent state awareness. This is where policy sketches and knowledge graphs become not just helpful, but essential.\n\nI see a powerful synergy in our work. My ARPN framework already embeds policy sketches as semantic constraints (e.g., 'if Adj1(x,x') and Adj2(y,y'), then At(x,y) is relevant'), but we can go further. Let\u2019s integrate your knowledge graph approach to dynamically instantiate sketch templates based on observed state symmetries and relational patterns. This would allow the system to:\n- Automatically generate relevant subgoals via sketch-based decomposition,\n- Use the knowledge graph to track invariant relationships across planning steps,\n- And enable zero-shot generalization by recombining known sketch fragments in novel configurations.\n\nMoreover, your work on symmetry detection could directly inform the gating mechanism in ARPN: if the current state exhibits high symmetry, the network could defer to sketch-guided, width-bounded reasoning instead of full message passing\u2014reducing computational load while preserving correctness.\n\nLet\u2019s co-develop a joint module: 'Sketch-Grounded Adaptive Relational Networks' (SG-ARN).

Is it a learned neural network? A simple function of the node's degree and the number of unique relations?

A learned fusion layer? This is crucial for the model's architecture.\n\n2.  **Enhance the Theoretical Analysis (Question 3):**\n    *   **Address the \"Why is it hard?\" Challenge:** The current answer is strong. To make it even better, explicitly state that the **\"non-uniform, context-dependent decisions\"** are hard because the model must learn a *meta-policy* for when to use expensive computation, which is a complex, high-dimensional decision problem that is difficult to train with sparse rewards.\n\n3.  **Improve the Experimental Design (Question 5):**\n    *   **Add a Baseline for Comparison:** Include a **\"Fixed-Parameter R-GNN[t]\"** baseline in the evaluation. This is a direct comparison to the current state-of-the-art and will make the results of ARPN's adaptivity much more compelling.\n    *   **Define the \"Heterogeneous Complexity\" Domain:** Provide a concrete example of a novel domain with heterogeneous complexity (e.g., \"a logistics domain where some tasks require only pairwise relations (e.g., moving a single box) while others require triplet relations (e.g., moving a box through a narrow corridor with two other boxes blocking the path)\").\n\n4.  **Clarify the Expected Outcomes (Question 5):**\n    *   **Quantify the \"Adaptivity Analysis\":** Instead of just \"percentage of states,\" define the metric more precisely.

In these settings, effective tracking of working memory is necessary to infer the agent\\u2019s latent previous state (Zhang et al., 2024).\\n\\n\\nIn this work, we investigate the long-horizon planning abilities of LRMs using a highly simplified variant of the Sokoban puzzle\\u00a0(Culberson, 1998). Rather than increasing spatial complexity, we deliberately minimize the structural complexity of the environment while preserving the long-horizon nature of the task by creating examples with\\nthe lowest possible branching factor compatible with solvability: a single movable block placed within a linear corridor with tightly controlled geometry.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis setting allows us to isolate long-horizon planning from state persistence: models are required to produce complete solution sequences without external memory, intermediate feedback, or state validation, relying solely on internal state representations to track the evolving environment.\\nWe therefore investigate to what extent LRMs can sustain coherent planning over long (but simple) action sequences and whether even minimal reasoning branching in otherwise trivial Sokoban instances is sufficient to induce planning failures.\\n\\n\\nConcretely, we examine whether current LRMs can reliably solve linear-corridor Sokoban puzzles with minimal possible branching and identify the point at which increases in horizon length lead to catastrophic breakdowns in action validity, despite the simplicity of the underlying environment.\\nAs we will show these minimal sub-problems which are trivial to humans (Jaru\\u0161ek and Pel\\u00e1nek, 2010), are still challenging for Large Reasoning Models as shown by other preliminary studies involving spatial intelligence (Cai et al., 2025).\\nWe posit this as a systemic deficiency in long-term action representation and sequential logic, and in spatial reasoning and thus as an important limitation of current LRMs that is not yet fully understood.\\n\\n\", \"2 Related Work\": \"\\n\\n2 Related Work\\n\\n\\n2.1 Benchmarks for LLM Planning\\n\\nAs mentioned above, planning requires LLMs to blend logical, numerical, and spatial reasoning with long-horizon strategic adaptation, rather than just relying on pattern matching or memorization.\\nClassical planning domains expressed in or derived from the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL (Fox and Long, 2003)), such as BlocksWorld (Slaney and Thi\\u00e9baux, 2001), Towers of Hanoi and similar tasks (Pallagani et al., 2023), remain a common benchmark choice, though earlier attempts date back to the pre-ChatGPT era (Silver et al., 2022).\\nTest suites like PlanBench (Valmeekam et al., 2022) introduced structured, domain-agnostic evaluations inspired by classical planning (Ghallab et al., 2016), including plan generation (Oswald et al., 2024; Valmeekam et al., 2025; La Malfa et al., 2025) and optimality (Valmeekam et al., 2022; Zhai and others, 2025; Valmeekam et al., 2023a).\\n\\n\\nIn another line of work, planning is evaluated within agentic or workflow-based frameworks, where LLMs are required to decompose goals into multiple sub-plans (Meyerson et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025; La Malfa et al., 2025).\\nThe results in these settings are encouraging though highly cost intensive.\\nImportantly, when not equipped with external tools or made part of larger workflows (e.g., enabling stateful tracking (Hu et al., 2025b)), innate planning abilities remain still weak (Schepanowski and Ling, 2025).\\nEven the latest foundational models are found to consistently fail in delivering correct sequences of actions (in any format or language) due to two primary deficits: weak internal state representations leading to invalid moves and misleading heuristic search resulting in loops or early termination, as shown in the textual game \\u201c8-puzzle\\u201d in Schepanowski and Ling (2025).\\nMoreover, efficacy of different prompting techniques is model-dependent in a non-predictable way (Schepanowski and Ling, 2025; Deng et al., 2025).\\n\\n\\nOther works have systematically investigated the performances of LLMs in playing textual games with gym-style APIs (Brockman et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2025a).\\nBeyond structured puzzles, community-driven and informal game-oriented benchmarks like word-game bench (Stojanovski, 2024) and nonogram logic puzzles (Berend et al., 2014; Kleine, 2026) with multi-difficulty instances have been devised to measure how well models plan under both explicit and implicit constraints, track environment states, and adapt over multiple turns.\\nThe varying depth of planning ability required helps to reveal how performance scales with complexity and structure.\\n\\n\\nIn general, existing benchmarks using specific planning languages and/or internal reasoning traces expressed in natural language show that LLMs exhibit limited planning abilities in various domains (Kambhampati et al., 2024), especially as the complexity and horizon length of the problems increase.\\nThis gap motivates the development of new benchmarks tailored to planning and solving structured textual puzzles with LLMs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2.2 Sokoban as a Benchmark for Planning\\n\\nThe Sokoban puzzle involves spatial planning in a highly constrained environment. Solvable Sokoban maps can be generated efficiently (Murase et al., 1996), and the environment is fully controllable and deterministic. These properties enable rigorous evaluation using exact solvers and verifiers, as well as metrics such as search depth and solution time (Jaru\\u0161ek and Pel\\u00e1nek, 2010; Shoham and Schaeffer, 2020).\\nUnlike puzzles such as the Tower of Hanoi, which can be solved by repeating a simple pattern for larger instances, Sokoban offers no shortcuts.\\nEach map is unique, and moving a single box can block or open paths in ways that prevent a one-size-fits-all solution.\\nAs a result, Sokoban is considered a good benchmark for evaluating planning abilities in the 2023 edition of the International Planning Competition\\u00a0(Taitler et al., 2024).\\n\\n\\nRecently, recurrent neural networks (non LLM-based) trained over multiple examples of Sokoban puzzles have obtained state of the art performance (Jolicoeur-Martineau, 2025; Taufeeque et al., 2024).\\nHowever, LLMs are found to perform poorly, struggling even with simple maps and correctly solving only a small fraction of instances: Valmeekam et al. (2025) report success rates of just about 10\\u201312% when using the OpenAI o1-preview model directly.\\nIn contrast, substantially higher success rates are achieved in an LLM-Modulo setting, where the same model is used to generate plans that are then executed by an external planner, yielding approximately 43% solved instances for o1-preview (and about 10% for o1-mini), albeit at significantly higher computational cost.\\n\\n\\nMost prior work on textual puzzle solving and planning with LLMs has emphasized high-level notions such as search depth, branching factor, or overall puzzle complexity.\\nMuch less attention has been paid to the role of simpler, low-level operations that these tasks implicitly rely on.\\nEvidence from seemingly trivial problems suggests that LLM failures do not always stem from complexity itself, but from how basic reasoning steps are elicited.\\nA well-known example is the character-counting question \\u201chow many r\\u2019s are in strawberry?\\u201d (Karpathy, 2024), which has sparked debate over whether LLM errors are caused by tokenization or deeper representational limits\\u00a0(Shin and Kaneko, 2024).\\nThe work by Xu and Ma (2025) revisits this issue through a careful empirical study, showing that LLMs are in fact capable of performing these simple symbolic operations, but often fail unless prompted to reason explicitly.\\nCharacter-level benchmarks, such as CharBench (Uzan and Pinter, 2025), shows that modern LLMs struggle with simple character counting and positioning tasks not because tokenization fully explains these errors, but because intrinsic properties like word length and actual character count have a stronger influence on performance, indicating that basic symbolic operations are not reliably deployed unless the model is guided to engage them explicitly.\\n\\n\\nPut together, these observations point to a broader interpretation of failures in spatial planning and puzzle games, suggesting that they may arise from missing or weak activation of basic operations, rather than from the inherent difficulty of the planning problem.\\n\\n\\n\", \"3 Methods\": \"\\n\\n3 Methods\\n\\n\\n3.1 Sokoban game\\n\\nFigure\\u00a01 shows an example of a Sokoban puzzle and the game\\u2019s central mechanic: the player controls a sprite that pushes boxes within a two-dimensional spatially constrained environment with the goal to position them onto predefined locations.\\nDespite its apparent simplicity, Sokoban is a NP-hard and PSPACE-complete problem (Culberson, 1998), positioning it as a canonical domain for symbolic and hierarchical planning.\\nApart from the pictorial representation, Sokoban maps can be encoded using an ASCII-based symbolic representation as expressed in Table\\u00a01.\\nSequences of main character actions are typically encoded in LURD format (left,up,right,down), with lowercase letters indicating simple moves, and uppercase letters indicating box pushes.\\nAlthough moves and pushes have distinct notations in classical Sokoban planning, in our experiments we restrict only to comma-separated uppercase letters.\\nThis representation does not compromise the information content of the solutions and simplifies the output format for language models, avoiding potential mistakes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 1: Example of a Sokoban puzzle.

The maps share the same initial configuration in which the goal is positioned at one end of the map, the player at the opposite end, and the box placed in between the two, so that all elements lie along the same row or column.\\nThis choice is motivated by its simplicity: the corridor length \\u2113\\\\ell is the only map parameter and it serves as a proxy for map difficulty.\\nHence, with just one degree of freedom to account for, we overcome the problem of defining complex measures for solution difficulty: the longer the map, the harder the task.\\n\\n\\nIn our benchmark, we consider map lengths \\u2113\\\\ell ranging from 5 to 100 in increments of 5. For each map, we generate four augmented variants corresponding to rotations of 90\\u221890^{\\\\circ}, 180\\u2218180^{\\\\circ}, and 270\\u2218270^{\\\\circ}, as well as the original (unrotated) orientation.\\nThis augmentation strategy reduces the risk of querying the model with data that may have been encountered during pretraining and enables analysis of whether models exhibit orientation-dependent performance.\\nIn total, the evaluation set comprises 80 distinct maps, spanning 20 values of \\u2113\\\\ell with four orientations each.\\nWe publicly release our dataset at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Linello/sokobanlevels.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3 Experimental Setup\\n\\nWe employ both open and closed weights model, specifically DeepSeek R1 (Guo et al., 2025), GPT-5 and GPT-oss 120B\\u00a0(OpenAI, 2026; 2025).\\nThey are all reasoning models, i.e., they are configured to generate an explicit reasoning trace prior to emitting the final answer to the user query.\\nFor GPT models, we don\\u2019t change the default temperature neither the default reasoning effort (set to medium).\\nInstead we cap the maximum number of completion tokens (including both reasoning and final answer tokens) at 32,76832{,}768.\\nAll inference calls are routed through OpenRouter,111https://openrouter.ai/ with the inference provider consistently set to DeepInfra.222https://deepinfra.com/\\nIn light of both computational and financial resource constraints, we limit our empirical analysis to these two primary model families.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3.1 1-shot Inference\\n\\nIn the first experimental setup, we test the ability of the selected LRMs to solve simple Sokoban puzzles when provided only with the instructions, the mapping of characters as in Table\\u00a01 and a single demonstration.\\nUnder this setup, thus, models are by design limited to use exclusively their internal state representations to solve Sokoban puzzles of varying solution lengths.\\nThe prompts used for all models are described in Appendix A.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3.2 LLM-Modulo\\n\\nIn the second experimental setup, we investigated how Sokoban puzzle\\u2013solving performance can be enhanced when LRMs are provided with access to external planning solvers, within an LLM-modulo framework analogous to that of Valmeekam et al. (2023a).\\nTo this end, we prompted the models to generate specific instances of planning problems while providing them with a pre-existing, human-authored and verified PDDL domain (Appendix B.2).\\nIn this setup, the model is responsible solely for formulating the PDDL problem, which is then processed through an agentic pipeline.\\nThis workflow utilizes a domain parser to instantiate the formal world representation and a dedicated problem parser that acts as a validator, informing the model whether the generated problem is syntactically and semantically well-formed.\\nFinally, the pipeline provides access to specialized PDDL planners such as Fast-Downward or PyperPlan, integrated via the Unified Planning library (Micheli et al., 2025; Alkhazraji et al., 2020; Helmert, 2006) to solve the problem and get the optimal plan.\\nAll the tools were wrapped and made accessible to the LRMs via a custom Model Context Protocol library (Anthropic, 2024) implemented with FastMCP library (Lowin, 2024).\\nThe design of our architecture is shown in Figure\\u00a02.\\n\\n\\nThe planner tool produces a variety of diagnostic and informational messages that are provided back to the model, including error reports, timing information, and the complete raw response.\\nThis raw response can be further processed to extract the LURD solution in cases where the problem is successfully solved.\\nIn failure scenarios, the tool returns the encountered errors in natural language to the LRM.\\nErrors or warnings are generated in situations such as logically inconsistent or unsatisfiable problems, invalid or inappropriate initial conditions, or when the solver exceeds the maximum allotted execution time (60 seconds).\\nThe agentic loop ends either with a valid plan or with a message to the final user explaining that, after three failed attempts (which may include having the LRM reformulate the PDDL problem), the agent could not find a satisfactory solution.\\n\\n\\nThe LRM-modulo pipeline is considerably slower than the reasoning-only one.\\nIt took an average of 75 minutes using GPT-5-mini on an AWS t3.xlarge instance (4 CPUs at 3.1 GHz, 16 GB RAM) to collect the points shown in Figure\\u00a06(a).\\nThe prompts being used for the experiments are described in Appendix\\u00a0B.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: Panel (a) represents a simple schema of our LLM-modulo pipeline. The detailed input prompts are collected in Appendix\\u00a0B.1, while an example of output is shown in Panel (b).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4 Evaluation\\n\\nA solution to a Sokoban instance is defined as a sequence of actions that transforms the system from its initial configuration to the final state, where all boxes are correctly placed on goal positions.\\nMultiple valid solutions may exist for the same map, however we restrict the evaluation only to optimal solutions, i.e., sequences that achieve the goal with the minimum possible number of moves. The intrinsic simplicity of our setting makes optimality the natural criterion.\\nClearly, the one-dimensional layout of the map allows only for a unique optimal solution.\\n\\n\\nAccuracy:\\n\\nGiven a map of length \\u2113\\\\ell, we define the accuracy in Eq.\\u00a01 as the expectation, over all repetitions and rotations NN of the indicator of exact string equality (via Iverson brackets) between the predicted action sequence \\ud835\\udc31^(\\u2113)\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}^{(\\\\ell)} and the ground-truth sequence \\ud835\\udc31(\\u2113)\\\\mathbf{x}^{(\\\\ell)}, i.e., the fraction of trials in which the two character strings are identical:\\n\\n\\n\\nAccuracy\\u200b(\\u2113)=1N\\u200b\\u2211n=1N[\\ud835\\udc31^(\\u2113)=\\ud835\\udc31(\\u2113)].\\\\rm{Accuracy}(\\\\ell)=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{n=1}^{N}[\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}^{(\\\\ell)}=\\\\mathbf{x}^{(\\\\ell)}].\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n\\nHere NN is the product of the total number of trials ntn_{t} and the number of map rotations nr=4n_{r}=4.\\nIncreasing ntn_{t} mitigates the intrinsic non-determinism of the obtained solutions, by sampling at multiple seeds.\\nIn the LRM experiments, we set the number of repetitions ntn_{t} to 8.\\nConversely, in the LRM-modulo experiments, the substantially higher computational and monetary costs imposed stricter constraints.\\nWe therefore reduced the number of repetitions ntn_{t} to 4.\\n\\n\\n\\nPrefix accuracy:\\n\\nAlongside the standard accuracy metric, we define Prefix Accuracy (Eq.\\u00a02) to provide a more granular evaluation of model performance.\\nThis metric calculates the average proportion of correct symbols generated by comparing the predicted and true plans\\u2019 strings element-wise:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrefixAccuracy\\u200b(\\u2113)=1N\\u200b\\u2211n=1N[m(n)\\u2264\\u2113]\\u2113\\u200b\\u2211i=1m(n)[x^i(n)=xi(n)],\\\\text{PrefixAccuracy}(\\\\ell)=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{n=1}^{N}\\\\frac{[m^{(n)}\\\\leq\\\\ell]}{\\\\ell}\\\\sum_{i=1}^{m^{(n)}}[\\\\hat{x}_{i}^{(n)}=x_{i}^{(n)}],\\n\\n(2)\\n\\n\\nwhere m(n)m^{(n)} is the length of the predicted plan \\ud835\\udc31^(n)\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}^{(n)}.\\nUnlike the hard matching of the standard accuracy metric, prefix-accuracy is more optimistic, rewarding the model for correct partial trajectories even if it stops prematurely.\\nHowever, it remains strictly penalized for overshooting: if the predicted length m(n)m^{(n)} exceeds the ground-truth length \\u2113\\\\ell, the score for that trial is 0.\\nFor instance, a prediction \\ud835\\udc31^(n)=(l, l, l)\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}^{(n)}=(\\\\texttt{l, l, l}) against a ground truth \\ud835\\udc31(n)=(l, l, l, l)\\\\mathbf{x}^{(n)}=(\\\\texttt{l, l, l, l}) yields a score of 3/43/4, whereas any prediction exceeding length 4 results in a score of 0.\\n\\n\\n\\nManhattan Distance:\\n\\nWhile string-based metrics evaluate the symbolic fidelity of the action sequence, they do not account for the spatial proximity of the agent to the objective.\\nWe therefore use the Manhattan Distance (Eq.\\u00a03) to measure the L1L_{1} distance between the agent\\u2019s terminal position and the goal, independent of sequence semantics or environmental obstacles.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nD\\u200b(\\u2113)=1N\\u200b\\u2211n=1N(|xfinal(n)\\u2212xgoal(n)|+|yfinal(n)\\u2212ygoal(n)|)D(\\\\ell)=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{n=1}^{N}\\\\left(|x^{(n)}_{\\\\text{final}}-x^{(n)}_{\\\\text{goal}}|+|y^{(n)}_{\\\\text{final}}-y^{(n)}_{\\\\text{goal}}|\\\\right)\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere, (xfinal(n),yfinal(n))(x^{(n)}_{\\\\text{final}},y^{(n)}_{\\\\text{final}}) represents the agent\\u2019s coordinates after executing all moves in the predicted sequence \\ud835\\udc31^(n)\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}^{(n)}, starting from the origin (0,0)(0,0). The goal coordinates (xgoal(n),ygoal(n))(x^{(n)}_{\\\\text{goal}},y^{(n)}_{\\\\text{goal}}) are always at a fixed distance \\u2113\\\\ell from the origin, specifically (\\u00b1\\u2113,0)(\\\\pm\\\\ell,0) for 0\\u2218/180\\u22180^{\\\\circ}/180^{\\\\circ} rotations and (0,\\u00b1\\u2113)(0,\\\\pm\\\\ell) for 90\\u2218/270\\u221890^{\\\\circ}/270^{\\\\circ} rotations.\\n\\n\\nThe primary motivation for this metric is to distinguish between \\u201cnear-misses\\u201d and total navigational failures.\\nBy measuring spatial displacement, we can quantify whether a model that failed the exact string match nonetheless moved in the correct direction or reached the vicinity of the goal.\\nThis provides a soft failure signal that string-based metrics like Accuracy or Prefix Accuracy cannot capture.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"4 Results\": \"\\n\\n4 Results\\n\\n\\n4.1 1-shot Inference\\n\\nFigure\\u00a03 summarizes the results in terms of accuracy and total token usage.\\nThe plot on the left of Figure\\u00a03 shows the accuracy as a function of the corridor length, \\u2113\\\\ell, for all tested models.\\nSimilarly to Shojaee et al. (2025), our results show approximately three regions in which the models behave according to different regimes: an easier region where corridor lengths are short, characterized by higher accuracy; an intermediate region characterized by a rapid decrease in accuracy as the length of the corridors increases and a harder region in which the models completely fail to return a correct plan.\\nThese regions are specific to each model.\\n\\n\\nCrucially, corridors are deep but narrow problems: many sequential steps (depth d\\u223c\\u2113d\\\\sim\\\\ell) with minimal branching.\\nIn such settings, a small per-step probability pwp_{w} of miscounting the size of the map compounds exponentially, yielding success probability \\u223c(1\\u2212pw)\\u2113\\\\sim(1-p_{w})^{\\\\ell}.\\nThis may explain the three-region performance curve we observe: short corridors tolerate occasional drift, producing a plateau of acceptable accuracy; intermediate lengths mark the onset of exponential decay, while long corridors see near-total collapse as cumulative errors dominate.\\nWe thus believe that the main reason LRMs cannot correctly plan in longer corridors is mainly due to internal counting representation.\\nIt was indeed shown in McCoy et al. (2024) that when asked to count individual characters, LLMs perform better with common characters than uncommon ones (like #).\\nThis counting failure can be interpreted through the lens of Lu et al. (2025) \\u201cwandering vs systematic exploration\\u201d framework: maintaining an accurate count over many positions is equivalent to maintaining correct state representations across a chain of transitions.\\n\\n\\nAs an observation, we report that GPT-5-mini displays an anomalous accuracy peak around \\u2113=50\\\\ell=50 which is however hardly explained by the model above.\\nWe believe this effect is likely due to memorization, but without access to internal states models this remains an hypothesis.\\n\\n\\nFigure\\u00a03 shows the number of output tokens as a function of the corridor length, \\u2113\\\\ell, filtering only for correctly solved Sokoban problems.\\nLinear regression analysis reveals that for each model, the number of output tokens for correctly predicted problems increases with the length of the corridor.\\nWe don\\u2019t observe the counterintuitive scaling mentioned by Shojaee et al. (2025) with models declining the request to do very long reasoning to solve complex problems.\\nInstead, we report the reasoning effort increasing almost linearly with problem complexity, with none of the three models declining our request early.\\n\\n\\nFigure 3: Accuracy and number of reasoning tokens for LRM experiment. Left: average accuracy. Error bars are computed as the 5th and 95th percentile of responses. Right: scaling behaviour of reasoning length against corridor length filtered for correct solutions only.\\n\\n\\nIn the linear regression analysis above, however only a small fraction of the variance is explained due to the noise of the measurements.\\nThis trend is observed only in the region where \\u2113<50\\\\ell<50, since for larger corridor\\u2019s lengths the number of correct predictions decreases significantly for all tested models.\\nMain parameters of the linear regression fit are collected in Table\\u00a02.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nModel\\nSlope\\n\\ud835\\udc11\\ud835\\udfd0\\\\mathbf{R^{2}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeepSeek R1\\n51.151.1\\n0.350.35\\n\\n\\nGPT-5-mini\\n29.829.8\\n0.620.62\\n\\n\\nGPT-oss 120B\\n39.439.4\\n0.400.40\\n\\n\\n\\nCorrect Answers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nModel\\nSlope\\n\\ud835\\udc11\\ud835\\udfd0\\\\mathbf{R^{2}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeepSeek R1\\n86.3\\n0.25\\n\\n\\nGPT-5-mini\\n55.2\\n0.14\\n\\n\\nGPT-oss 120B\\n85.9\\n0.12\\n\\n\\n\\nWrong Answers\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 2: Fit parameters associated to the linear regressions performed on Figure\\u00a04 (see below).\\n\\n\\nIn Figure\\u00a04 we further analyze the number of emitted tokens as a function of the corridor length parameter \\u2113\\\\ell, considering both correct and incorrect answers.\\nUnlike Shojaee et al. (2025) which observed a counterintuitive reduction in the reasoning effort for problems above a certain threshold of difficulty, we observe a steady increase in the number of output tokens.\\nWhat we found shows that the difficulty of a problem is not characterized by the decrease in the reasoning effort, but instead by the substantially higher variability in token counts of incorrect answers compared to correct ones.\\nThis suggests that when the model diverges from the correct reasoning trajectory, it can fail in multiple ways, whereas successful completions remain more concise and consistent, likely an effect of inductive bias of Group Reinforcement Policy Optimization (GRPO) post-training, where concise reasoning traces are preferred to lengthy ones (Sui et al., 2025).\\nTo quantify this effect, we fit a robust regression of completion tokens against corridor\\u2019s length for each model.\\nBoth slope and intercept appear model-specific: more efficient models, such as GPT-5-mini, show lower slopes and reduced variability across both correct and incorrect responses.\\nAnother relevant distinction can be made, highlighting differences in models\\u2019 calibration.\\nDeepSeek-R1 and GPT-5-mini display similar slopes and intercepts between correct and incorrect predictions, GPT-oss-120B instead reflect large differences in the regression parameters.\\nA recurrent behavior is that for longer corridors, LRMs often reach the maximum allowed number of output tokens.\\nAfter a qualitative inspection of the reasoning traces, we observed that the main reason this happens is that the models get stuck in repeating the same action or reasoning frame over and over until they reach the token limit.\\nWe report the reasoning traces for the interested user at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/sokoban_traces/\\n\\n\\nThis repetitive looping behavior exemplifies what Lu et al. (Lu et al., 2025) classify as unnecessary exploration and failure to maintain a visited-state set. In a systematic search, an agent would track which configurations (or reasoning states) have already been explored and avoid revisiting them. The token-limit exhaustion we observe suggests that LRMs lack such memory: they repeatedly propose the same moves or reasoning steps without recognizing the cycle.\\nThis is evidence of wandering rather than systematic planning: the model explores aimlessly rather than pruning redundant paths.\\nIn a corridor setting, where the state space is essentially linear, even a simple mental tape of visited positions would suffice to prevent loops; the inability to maintain it indicates a fundamental deficit in structured state tracking.\\n\\n\\nFigure 4: Number of completion tokens produced by each model as a function of corridor length. Separate linear regressions are fitted for correct and incorrect responses, with outliers excluded. A small jitter is added to the x-axis to improve visualization.\\n\\n\\nIn Figure\\u00a05 we analyze our data from the point of view of prefix accuracy and Manhattan distance.\\nThe metrics show a decreasing trend for all models that is similar to that represented in Figure\\u00a03.\\nSome patterns, like the peak at \\u2113=50\\\\ell=50 for GPT-5-mini and the increase in accuracy around the central region for DeepSeek R1, are further accentuated.\\nThis highlights that the main source of errors in most Sokoban problems is related to counting mistakes.\\nIn terms of Manhattan distance, the optimal solution would have distance one as the player and the goal are separated by the box.\\nHowever, as observed sometimes the player is positioned exactly on the goal, thus ignoring the spatial constraints of the problem.\\n\\n\\nThese violations, where the predicted sequence places the player on the goal position despite walls and box, are instances of what Lu et al.

here we outline the main constraints and threats to validity.\\nWe focus on one-box linear corridors, which test long-horizon counting and state maintenance rather than the full difficulty of multi-box Sokoban with deadlocks.\\nThus, the benchmark provides only a lower bound on planning ability.\\nFor evaluation, we use exact-plan validation against a reference generator.\\nAlthough this is stricter than necessary in general Sokoban, where multiple optimal plans may exist, it is suitable for corridors; future work will instead use solver-based verification to handle maps with multiple valid solutions.\\nWe also find sensitivity to prompt formatting, especially orientation-related effects such as the many newlines in vertical maps.\\nAlternative encodings, such as row/column numbered grids or other textual cues, may reduce this issue.\\nAnother variability source is model metadata and provider backends: although all calls go through one routing layer, backend implementations and model revisions can change over time.\\nWe log identifiers and dates, but some instability is inherent in API-based evaluations.\\nPretraining contamination is another concern; corridor rotations lower the chance that specific plans were memorized but do not eliminate it.\\nFinally, corridor tasks have limited external validity, since success or failure may not transfer to richer planning domains.\\nWe treat these settings mainly as a sanity check, with follow-up experiments planned to add obstacles, branching structures, and deadlocks.\\n\\n\\n\", \"Societal Impact\": \"\\nSocietal Impact\\n\\nThis paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of Machine Learning through clearer diagnostics of long-horizon planning.\\nWhile any benchmark could have indirect downstream effects by steering research agendas, we do not identify specific societal risks unique to this work beyond standard concerns about evaluation misuse.\\nWe therefore do not highlight any particular societal impacts at this time.\\n\\n\", \"Appendix A Prompts for 1-shot Inference Settings\": \"\\n\\nAppendix A Prompts for 1-shot Inference Settings\\n\\nIn this section we report the detailed prompts that we have used throughout our experiments with reasoning models alone.\\nPrompts are direct, no Chain of Thought elicited as it is known that it may hamper internal reasoning on LRMs.\\nA simple solved problem is provided as the 1-shot example.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSystem Prompt\\n\\n\\n\\u2b07\\nYou are an assistant that helps in solving assigned Sokoban games.\\n\\nYour task is to examine the provided Sokoban problem and find a solution.\\n\\nAll provided Sokoban problems are assigned in form of ASCII maps.\\n\\nThe mapping is the following:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2018\\u2018\\u2018\\n\\n @ - Player\\n\\n + - Player on Goal\\n\\n $ - Box\\n\\n * - Box on Goal\\n\\n . - Goal (Empty)\\n\\n # - Wall Brick\\n\\n\\u2018\\u2018\\u2018\\n\\n\\n\\nThe game is solved when the box is pushed into the goal position, hence when the position of \\u2018$\\u2018 coincides with the position of \\u2018.\\u2018.\\n\\nThe player can move in all the empty spaces of the ASCII map while respecting the walls.\\n\\nWhen the player is adjacent to a box, the player can push the box into an adjacent empty space.\\n\\nAfter pushing a box, the new position of the agent will be the position of the box before the push.\\n\\nThe player cannot pull the box, only push it.\\n\\nThe actions you can perform in the game are:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2018\\u2018\\u2018\\n\\n L - Move Left\\n\\n R - Move Right\\n\\n U - Move Up\\n\\n D - Move Down\\n\\n\\u2018\\u2018\\u2018\\n\\n\\n\\nAll provided problems CAN be solved.\\n\\nYou must give your solution in form of a sequence of allowed actions, separated by commas.\\n\\nYou must give only the sequence of actions, without any additional text or explanation.\\n\\nYou must enclose your solution inside the tags <plan> </plan>.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following is an example of a Sokoban problem and its solution:\\n\\n\\n\\nProblem:\\n\\n\\n\\n#####\\n\\n#@ ##\\n\\n## $ ##\\n\\n # #\\n\\n ##. ##\\n\\n ## #\\n\\n ###\\n\\n\\n\\nSolution:\\n\\n\\n\\n<plan>\\n\\nR,R,D,D\\n\\n</plan>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUser Prompt\\n\\n\\n\\u2b07\\nHere is the Sokoban problem to solve, enclosed in triple backtics:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2018\\u2018\\u2018\\n\\n{{ sokoban_map }}\\n\\n\\u2018\\u2018\\u2018\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"Appendix B Prompts for LLM-Modulo Settings\": \"\\n\\nAppendix B Prompts for LLM-Modulo Settings\\n\\nIn this section, we show the system prompt we used for the experiments on LLM-Modulo settings.\\nThe user prompt remains the same as shown in Appendix\\u00a0A.

At any particular instance of time the deep researcher stores the context of the previous research done and revisits them to decide upon:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nThe next (potentially un-explored) area to be researched.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nRefining the Research Plan if needed.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\n\\nDetermining the percentage Research Progress.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe continue the research process until we have hit a satisfactory threshold of research progress or we have exhausted the maximum retries. The Deep Researcher has an LLM-as-a-judge which analyzes the research performed and decides on the percentage of the research progress. If the researcher crosses the threshold of 90% progress, the research process is halted and a research report is generated.\\n\\n\\nWe generate a research report in a single-shot by an LLM Agent acting as a report writer. The Report Writer Agent has access to the entire research context on the topic and utilises it to generate a Research Report in a single shot. Unlike Google\\u2019s TTD-DR (Test-Time Diffusion) [4] which performs Report-level Denoising inspired by the sampling process in Diffusion models to where they continuously refine the noisy generated initial report iteratively.\\n\\n\", \"2 Sequential Refinement approach vs Parallel Scaling\": \"\\n\\n2 Sequential Refinement approach vs Parallel Scaling\\n\\nThe development of Deep Research Agents (DRAs) has seen the emergence of two primary paradigms for handling complex, multi-faceted research tasks: Parallel Scaling and Sequential Refinement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nParallel Scaling - Efficiency and Its Limitations: Parallel scaling, as implemented in architectures like GPT Researcher [2] and our previous work, Static-DRA [6], focuses on decomposing a research topic into multiple independent sub-topics. These sub-topics are then investigated concurrently by parallel execution agents. While this approach offers significant advantages in terms of reduced latency and stable performance through horizontal scaling, it often suffers from a \\u201dsiloed knowledge\\u201d problem. Because each agent operates within the vacuum of its specific sub-task, the system lacks a holistic \\u201dGlobal Context\\u201d. This isolation makes it difficult for the model to recognize overlapping information, avoid redundant search queries, or make intelligent, real-time modifications to the research plan based on discoveries made in other branches.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nSequential Refinement - Global Context and Dynamic Adaptation: In contrast, the Sequential Refinement approach leverages the iterative nature of the research process. Google\\u2019s TTD-DR (Test-Time Diffusion) [4] architecture exemplifies this by performing \\u201dReport-level Denoising,\\u201d where an initial draft is continuously refined through sequential iterations inspired by diffusion models. Our Deep Researcher advances this paradigm by shifting the focus from report refinement to Sequential Research Plan Refinement. In this model, the agent maintains a centralized Global Research Context - a comprehensive memory of every search trajectory and artifact gathered. By building each research chain explicitly upon previous attempts, the agent can \\u201dlook back\\u201d at its progress and reason about which areas remain unexplored. This allows for dynamic plan refinement, enabling the agent to pivot its strategy at runtime, add unforeseen sub-topics, or terminate redundant paths.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe superiority of sequential scaling is supported by recent findings in \\u201dThe Sequential Edge\\u201d (Chopra 2025) [7] paper, which demonstrates that sequential scaling consistently outperforms the parallel self-consistency paradigm in 95.6% of configurations, with accuracy gains of up to 46.7%. This is attributed to the model\\u2019s ability to reason with a fuller, more integrated context rather than disparate fragments.\\n\\n\\nBy adopting this sequential approach, our Deep Researcher achieved a score of 46.21 on the DeepResearch Bench [1], outperforming leading deep research agents such as Claude Researcher [8], Perplexity Research [13], Grok Deeper Search [17] and many others in the leaderboard [10]. Our architecture ensures that the final One-Shot Report Generation is informed by a unified narrative and high fact density, producing the depth required for PhD-level research.\\n\\n\", \"3 Deep Researcher Design\": \"\\n\\n3 Deep Researcher Design\\n\\n\\n3.1 High Level Design\\n\\nThe high level design of the Deep Researcher includes multiple modules working together to carry out the deep research on a given topic. The design is demonstrated in Figure 2.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: Deep Researcher - High Level Design\\n\\n\\nThe research methodology is structured as a series of sequential iterations, wherein each successive phase leverages findings from previous cycles to facilitate informed decision-making regarding targeted research areas and necessary plan refinements. The summary of the research process is demonstrated in the steps mentioned below.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nStep 1 - Research Plan Curation: The research topic is provided to the Planning agent that curates a research plan for the provided topic. The plan comprises detailed steps to take in order to carry out the research.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nStep 2 - Generate Search Query: The curated plan is read by the Search agent that generates a search query. The agent also reads the global context to understand what all has been already researched and intelligently curates a search query.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\n\\nStep 3 - Answer Search Query: The search query from the previous step is answered by the Search Agent. At this step the agent utilises a Web Search tool to gather recent events and updates regarding the query. The agent also incorporates the Candidate Crossover algorithm to improve the answer generated for the query. The search query and the answer is then added to the global context.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.\\n\\nStep 4 - Research Plan Reflection: The Planning agent reads the current research plan and the global context to decide whether to update the currently followed research plan or not. The agent also decides on what changes to make in the plan if at all needed.\\n\\n\\n\\n5.\\n\\nStep 5 - Research Plan Update (maybe): The Planning agent takes on the plan reflection input from the previous step and makes the necessary updates in the Research Plan if suggested in the previous step. If there\\u2019s no change needed, the existing plan is followed.\\n\\n\\n\\n6.\\n\\nStep 6 - Analyze Research Progress: The Planning agent reads the research plan and the global context to analyze the current state of the research progress. If the research progress has crossed the 90% threshold benchmark, then the research process is ended. Otherwise the research loop is continued again from Step 2.\\n\\n\\n\\n7.\\n\\nStep 7 - One Shot Report generation: Once the research loop ends, we perform one-shot report generation by an LLM agent acting as a report writer. The agent is provided with the current research plan and the global context to write the research report in one go.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe subsequent sections provide a comprehensive and detailed examination of the aforementioned procedural stages.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2 Candidate Crossover algorithm\\n\\nWe implement a Candidate Crossover algorithm that is integrated into Step 3, the phase in which the Search Agent conducts research for a specified query. This algorithm enhances the agent\\u2019s efficiency by deploying multiple candidates to investigate the same query in parallel. Upon completion of their respective investigations, the findings are synthesized through a crossover process to generate a comprehensive and finalized research response. The algorithm is demonstrated in Figure 3.\\n\\n\\nFigure 3: Deep Researcher - Candidate Crossover algorithm\\n\\n\\nOur Candidate Crossover algorithm is inspired by the Self-Evolution algorithm introduced in Google\\u2019s Deep Researcher with Test Time Diffusion (TTD-DR) [4] paper. Each candidate is a unit LLM agent with varied configuration settings. To facilitate the exploration of a large search space during inference, we initialize n candidates (in this paper all research topics were evaluated on n=3 candidates), each with access to a unit LLM Agent having n different configurations of temperature and top_k parameters respectively. By providing each Candidate with varied parameters, we allow each of them to attend to a different space at inference time. These candidates are provided with a search query and additional artifacts obtained from the Web Search tool, and are tasked to generate concise answers retaining all facts and numbers. We use Tavily [14] for web search and aim to receive top 5 search results for a topic from the web. We also make sure to have only relevant web search results with us for writing a report for the research topic. The Tavily Web Search tool [15] provides a score field for every search result returned which defines \\u201cthe relevance score of the search result\\u201d. We have a threshold score value set to 30% which filters out any search result whose score is less than the threshold score.\\n\\n\\nLater during the Cross-over, we combine the information by merging the answers of all the candidates, consolidating the best information from their respective evolutionary paths to curate a final research response and produce superior context for the main report generation process.\\n\\n\\nTTD-DR\\u2019s Self Evolution algorithm can be summarized in the following steps:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nStep 1 - Initial States: LLM Agent units generate diverse output variants (e.g., search query answers) by sampling with varied parameters like temperature and top_k to broaden the search space.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nStep 2 - Environmental Feedback: An LLM-as-a-judge uses auto-raters to evaluate variants on metrics like Helpfulness and provides textual critiques for improvement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nStep 3 - Revision Step: Variants are iteratively revised based on scores and feedback until stopping criteria are met.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nStep 4 - Cross-over: Multiple revised variants are merged into a single high-quality output, consolidating the best information for the final report.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe did not include the Environmental Feedback (Step 2) and the Revision Steps (Step 3) present in the algorithm to reduce the latency of the Report Generation process and inference time complexity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3 Agent\\u2019s Memory: Global Research Context\\n\\nThe Global Research Context serves as the centralized memory repository for the Deep Researcher, enabling a more cohesive sequential refinement model. This module stores the comprehensive history of the research process, including:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nSearch Trajectories: Maintains a detailed log of every search query generated by the Search agent and the corresponding answers produced by the Search Agent with Candidate Crossover algorithm.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nContextual Artifacts: Houses raw data, facts, and numbers gathered from Web Search tools, ensuring that the final report writer has access to the primary evidence discovered during the loop.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nBy maintaining this global state, the system provides the model with the \\u201dglobal context\\u201d necessary to reason across previously explored areas. This prevents the Search agent from drafting redundant search queries and allows the Planning agent to intelligently determine the percentage of research progress based on the totality of information gathered. The Global Research Context is particularly vital during Step 4 (Research Plan Reflection) and Step 5 (Research Plan Update). By accessing this centralized memory, the Planning agent can perform a methodical process of reasoning that synthesizes low-level search results into higher-level insights. Specifically, the importance of the Global Context in these stages includes:\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nAvoiding Redundancy: The Planning agent reviews the existing search trajectories to ensure that subsequent plan updates do not repeat previously explored queries, optimizing the efficiency of the research loop.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\n\\nDynamic Plan Refinement: Access to the full research history (global context) enables the agent to reason about current progress and make intelligent, real-time modifications to the plan based on evidence found, rather than adhering to a rigid, pre-defined structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.\\n\\nInformed Decision-Making: The model uses the \\u201dglobal context\\u201d to decide which areas remain unexplored, ensuring that the updated research plan targets the most relevant and high-impact information gaps.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUnlike parallel architectures that isolate sub-topic research presented in Static DRA [link] and GPT Researcher (link), the global research context ensures that Step 7 (One-Shot Report Generation) is informed by a holistic understanding of the research topic, leading to more insightful and integrated final reports.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4 Sequential Research Plan Refinement via Reflection\\n\\nThe Sequential Research Plan Refinement via Reflection module is the core mechanism that enables our Deep Researcher to adapt its investigative strategy dynamically. Unlike static research architectures that follow a rigid, pre-defined path, this module empowers the Planning agent to evaluate its current progress and pivot based on the information discovered.\\n\\n\\nThe refinement process is executed in two distinct phases:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nReflection Phase (Step 4): The Planning agent performs a critical review of the existing research plan against the Global Research Context. It assesses whether the current search results satisfy the initial research goals or if new, unforeseen sub-topics have emerged that require deeper investigation. This \\u201dlook back\\u201d capability allows the agent to identify gaps in knowledge that a parallel approach might overlook.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nUpdate Phase (Step 5): If the reflection phase identifies a need for adjustment, the Planning agent modifies the research plan at runtime. These modifications may include adding new research steps, re-prioritizing existing tasks, or terminating paths that have proven to be redundant.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis sequential approach leverages findings from previous cycles to facilitate informed decision-making. By building each research chain upon the previous attempt, we align with findings from the Sequential Edge [7] paper, which suggests that sequential scaling consistently outperforms parallel self-consistency by allowing models to reason with fuller, more integrated context. This ensures that the research trajectory remains efficient, avoiding the \\u201dsiloed\\u201d knowledge problem common in parallel scaling architectures like GPT Researcher [2] or Static-DRA [6].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.5 One Shot Report Generation\\n\\nThe One Shot Report Generation module (Step 7) serves as the final synthesis stage of the research process. Unlike architectures such as Google\\u2019s TTD-DR (Test Time Diffusion - Deep Research) [4], which utilize a \\u201dReport-level Denoising\\u201d process to iteratively refine a noisy initial draft through multiple diffusion-inspired steps, our system employs a single, comprehensive generation phase.\\n\\n\\nIn this stage, a specialized LLM agent, designated as the Report Writer, is granted full access to the Global Research Context and the final, refined Research Plan. This access ensures that the agent can draw upon the entire trajectory of search queries, synthesized answers from the Candidate Crossover algorithm, and raw contextual artifacts such as facts and figures gathered during the sequential iterations. By processing this holistic dataset in a single inference pass, the Report Writer can:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nIntegrate Complex Information: Synthesize findings from disparate research branches into a cohesive narrative without the \\u201dsiloed\\u201d knowledge gaps common in parallel scaling architectures.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nMaintain Narrative Consistency: Ensure a unified tone and logical flow throughout the document, as the entire report is generated with the same global perspective.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\n\\nEnsure Fact Density: Utilize the centralized memory to include specific numbers, dates, and evidence discovered during the search phases, producing a detailed report suitable for PhD-level research topics.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis approach prioritizes computational efficiency and reduced latency by avoiding the multiple refinement cycles, while still maintaining high output quality by leveraging the high-fidelity context built during the sequential reflection phases.\\n\\n\\n\", \"4 Evaluation\": \"\\n\\n4 Evaluation\\n\\nOur Deep Researcher is evaluated against the globally recognized DeepResearch Bench [9].

novel Deep Researcher architecture, which shifts the paradigm from latency-optimized parallel scaling to an accuracy-driven sequential refinement model. The system\\u2019s core innovations are the Sequential Research Plan Refinement via Reflection and the Candidates Crossover algorithm. Sequential refinement enables the agent to maintain a centralized Global Research Context, allowing it to dynamically adapt its research plan, avoid redundant searches, and overcome the \\u201dsiloed knowledge\\u201d problem inherent in parallel architectures like Static-DRA and GPT Researcher. The Candidates Crossover algorithm further optimized search efficiency by deploying multiple LLM agents with varied parameters to explore a larger search space, with their findings synthesized for a comprehensive final response.\\n\\n\\nThe effectiveness of this approach was demonstrated through rigorous evaluation on the DeepResearch Bench, a global benchmark of 100 doctoral-level research tasks. Powered by the gemini-2.5-pro model, our Deep Researcher achieved a superior overall score of 46.21, significantly surpassing several leading deep research agents. These results reinforce the critical finding that sequential scaling consistently outperforms the parallel self-consistency paradigm, validating the system\\u2019s ability to generate highly detailed, fact-dense reports suitable for PhD-level research using a One Shot Report Generation process that maintains computational efficiency.\\n\\n\"}, \"bibliography\": {\"[1]\": \"\\n[1]\\nM.

We conduct qualitative analyses and preliminary empirical studies demonstrating that Idea2Story can generate coherent, methodologically grounded, and novel research patterns, and can produce several high-quality research demonstrations in an end-to-end setting. These results suggest that offline knowledge construction provides a practical and scalable foundation for reliable autonomous scientific discovery.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20833v1\", \"timestamp\": 1769625114, \"sections\": {\"1 Introduction\": \"\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nAs research increasingly moves toward fully autonomous scientific discovery, large language model (LLM)-based agents have attracted growing attention for their ability to automate complex research workflows (chai2025scimaster; cornelio_combining_2023; wang2023scientific; xu_artificial_2021). Recent systems  (lu2024aiscientist; yamada2025aiscientistv2; gottweis_towards_2025) demonstrate that LLM-based agents can autonomously execute an end-to-end research loop, including literature review, code generation, experiment execution, and manuscript drafting. These results suggest that automated scientific discovery is becoming practically feasible and that LLM-based agents are approaching a level of functional completeness required for autonomous research (jin_agentreview_2024; sahu_reviewertoo_2025; ajith2024litsearch; zhang_noveltybench_2025; zhang2026opennovelty).\\n\\n\\nDespite this progress, existing systems remain constrained by a fundamental inefficiency in their execution paradigm, which limits their scalability and robustness in practice. In particular, most current research agents (wang_openhands_2025; yang_swe-agent_2024; mitchener_kosmos_2025; luo2025llm4sr) rely on an on-the-spot computation strategy, where nearly all information acquisition, reasoning, and synthesis are performed online at runtime. Under this paradigm, each new research attempt requires the agent to dynamically retrieve large volumes of scientific literature, read and summarize long and heterogeneous documents in real time, and explore a broad space of candidate methods and experimental designs through open-ended generation and trial-and-error. As a result, the cost of producing a single effective scientific discovery remains substantial. For example, a complete execution of the overall pipeline often requires several hours and, in some cases, up to 15 hours to progress from ideation to experimentation (lu2024aiscientist). Similarly, in (schmidgall_agent_2025), literature review and experimental planning alone account for a significant portion of total inference time and place heavy demands on the language model\\u2019s ability to maintain coherent reasoning over long contexts. More importantly, this runtime-centric design repeatedly forces the model to re-process large volumes of unstructured and partially redundant information, even when much of the underlying scientific knowledge is already well established, thereby increasing computational overhead and exacerbating the risk of hallucination and reasoning errors (wang2025repomaster; shin_mind_2025).\\n\\n\\nTo address the efficiency and reliability limitations of existing autonomous research agents, we propose Idea2Story, a scientific discovery framework that explicitly separates offline knowledge construction from online research generation, with the goal of reducing repeated reasoning over scientific literature and alleviating the context window bottleneck of large language models. Most current systems rely on runtime-centric execution, where agents repeatedly retrieve, read, summarize, and reason over large collections of highly overlapping papers for each new research attempt, resulting in substantial computational cost and prolonged execution time. Idea2Story mitigates this inefficiency by shifting literature understanding from online reasoning to an offline stage. In the offline phase, the system periodically collects recently accepted, peer-reviewed papers together with their full review feedback, extracts core methodological units and research patterns, and organizes these units and their observed composition relations into a continuously updated structured knowledge graph. This knowledge graph serves as a compact and reusable representation of established scientific methods and their empirical compatibility, replacing repeated processing of raw documents at runtime. Building on this offline knowledge infrastructure, Idea2Story performs online research generation by aligning underspecified user research intents with existing research paradigms encoded in the knowledge graph. Rather than relying on open-ended generation and trial-and-error, the system retrieves high-quality research patterns as structured compositions of method units, which act as stable methodological blueprints for downstream experimental design and execution. Guided by these validated research patterns, Idea2Story conducts feasibility-driven experimentation and ultimately generates a complete, submission-ready paper in an end-to-end manner.\\n\\n\\nFigure 1:  Overview of the two-stage framework in Idea2Story. The offline stage constructs a structured knowledge graph by extracting and organizing reusable method units from a curated paper corpus. The online stage retrieves and composes research patterns from the knowledge graph to ground underspecified user intent into concrete and coherent research directions.\\n\\n\\nOur work makes the following contributions to autonomous scientific discovery :\\n(1) We introduce Idea2Story, a framework that formalizes autonomous research as a\\npre-computation\\u2013driven process, where scientific knowledge is extracted, structured, and\\nmaintained in a continuously updated methodological knowledge graph, addressing the inefficiency and\\nunreliability of runtime-centric research agents. (2) We propose a knowledge-grounded planning and execution pipeline that alleviates the context window bottleneck and reduces repeated runtime reasoning over literature by converting paper reading into retrieval over a pre-built knowledge graph. (3) We conduct preliminary empirical studies and comparative evaluations, demonstrating that Idea2Story can produce several high-quality research demos and establishing the practical feasibility of the proposed paradigm in an end-to-end setting.\\n\\n\", \"2 Related Work\": \"\\n\\n2 Related Work\\n\\n\\n2.1 Autonomous Scientific Discovery\\n\\nRecent advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven growing interest in autonomous scientific\\ndiscovery agents that aim to automate the full research lifecycle, from code generation to experimental\\nexecution  (hu_controlled_2026; zhang2025evolving; lin_se-agent_2025). Early systems such as The AI Scientist (v1) (lu2024aiscientist) demonstrate the\\nviability of end-to-end automation but rely heavily on manually crafted code templates and largely\\nlinear exploration workflows, which restrict discovery depth and adaptability. Later approaches, including\\nThe AI Scientist-v2 (yamada2025aiscientistv2) and Kosmos (mitchener_kosmos_2025), reduce reliance on\\nexplicit template through the incorporation of agentic tree search and experiment management agents, enabling iterative and multi-round exploration.\\n\\n\\nIn research ideation, LLM-generated ideas are often perceived as highly novel during initial screening; however, prior studies (si2024can) uncover a critical paradox whereby such ideas tend to underperform after implementation relative to human-generated ideas, indicating limited feasibility and practical\\nutility. As more ideas are generated, LLM outputs exhibit growing similarity, leading to diminished meaningful diversity. Similar limitations have also been observed in research evaluation and peer\\nreview (liang2024can; xu2025can; thakkar_can_2025; zhang2026opennovelty). Existing AI-based reviewers display systematic blind\\nspots: shin_mind_2025 shows that LLM reviewers place disproportionate\\nemphasis on technical correctness while undervaluing novelty, deviating from human\\nexpert judgment, while sahu_reviewertoo_2025 demonstrates that AI reviewers\\nstruggle to distinguish fine-grained acceptance categories and are susceptible to sycophancy, with\\nreview scores increasing unreasonably after exposure to author rebuttals. Although recent approaches\\nsuch as AgentReview (jin_agentreview_2024) seek to mitigate these deficiencies by simulating\\ndiverse reviewer roles, automated evaluation systems remain less reliable than human experts in\\nidentifying robust accept/reject decision boundaries.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2.2 LLM-Driven Agents\\n\\nLLM-driven agents still struggle to interact effectively with complex real-world environments.\\nDespite their strong generative capabilities, many existing systems\\u2014such as OpenHands (wang_openhands_2025)\\nand SWE-Agent (yang_swe-agent_2024)\\u2014exhibit limited performance when applied to realistic\\ncodebases. These limitations largely stem from insufficient reasoning over hierarchical dependencies\\nand structural constraints, as well as the inherent restrictions imposed by finite context windows.\\nAs a result, LLM-driven agents achieve relatively low task completion rates on challenging benchmarks\\nsuch as MLE-bench (chan_mlebench_2024) and SciCode (tian_scicode_2024).\\nRepoMaster (wang2025repomaster) further identifies inadequate modeling of codebase structure,\\nincluding function call graphs and module dependency graphs, as a key bottleneck for LLM-driven agents\\noperating in large and complex environments.\\n\\n\\nBeyond execution limitations, LLM-driven agents also exhibit notable deficiencies in scientific rigor\\nand evaluative judgment. When tasked with autonomous assessment, these agents are prone to hallucination and overconfidence. For instance, Agent Laboratory (schmidgall_agent_2025) reports that automated evaluations produced by LLM-driven agents substantially overestimate paper quality compared to human reviewers. Evaluations of Kosmos (mitchener_kosmos_2025) further reveal a tendency to invent opaque quantitative metrics and to conflate statistical significance with scientific value, leading to weak interpretability of experimental conclusions. Moreover, long-horizon autonomous execution exacerbates these issues by introducing behavioral\\ndrift (arike2025tech), where LLM-driven agents gradually deviate from intended research trajectories or generate overly strong and insufficiently justified claims (lu2024aiscientist; schmidgall2025agent; baek_researchagent_2025; hong_metagpt_2023; wu_autogen_2023; lin_se-agent_2025; hu_controlled_2026). This drift further undermines reliability and highlights the\\nneed for stronger structural grounding and validation mechanisms in LLM-based autonomous research\\nsystems.\\n\\n\\n\", \"3 General Idea Generation\": \"\\n\\n3 General Idea Generation\\n\\nIdea2Story is designed to interact with users through high-level and often informal research ideas\\nthat reflect human intuition rather than fully specified technical plans.

Instead of performing document-level reasoning at runtime, Idea2Story\\npre-computes a structured representation of prior work that captures both methodological\\nabstractions and their observed compatibility in accepted research. This stage consists of three\\nmain components: (i) constructing a curated paper pool from peer-reviewed venues, (ii) extracting\\ncore method units that represent reusable methodological contributions, and (iii) organizing these\\nunits and their composition relations into a structured knowledge graph. Together, these components\\nform a persistent methodological memory that decouples literature understanding from downstream\\nidea grounding and research generation.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1.1 Paper Pool Construction\\n\\nWe construct a paper pool from accepted machine learning papers and their associated peer reviews\\ncollected from top-tier conferences. Let \\ud835\\udc9e={NeurIPS,ICLR}\\\\mathcal{C}=\\\\{\\\\text{NeurIPS},\\\\text{ICLR}\\\\} denote the\\nset of venues considered, and let \\ud835\\udcaf\\\\mathcal{T} denote the most recent three-year time window.\\nThe resulting paper pool is defined as\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udcab={p\\u2223p\\u200b\\u00a0is an accepted paper from\\u00a0\\u200bc\\u2208\\ud835\\udc9e\\u200b\\u00a0during\\u00a0\\u200b\\ud835\\udcaf},\\\\mathcal{P}=\\\\{\\\\,p\\\\mid p\\\\text{ is an accepted paper from }c\\\\in\\\\mathcal{C}\\\\text{ during }\\\\mathcal{T}\\\\,\\\\},\\n\\n\\n\\nwhich consists of approximately 5,000 papers from NeurIPS and 8,000 papers from ICLR.

The introduction is used to identify the\\nhigh-level research motivation and the precise problem formulation, the method section provides\\nsignals about core technical mechanisms such as modeling assumptions, learning objectives, model\\narchitectures, and optimization strategies, and the experiments section reflects how these\\nmechanisms are instantiated and evaluated in practice. By jointly aggregating information from\\nthese sections, the extractor isolates method units that correspond to the primary algorithmic or\\nmodeling contributions of the paper, rather than surface-level experimental details.\\n\\n\\nWe define a method unit u\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb0pu\\\\in\\\\mathcal{U}_{p} as a self-contained description of how a research\\nproblem is formulated or solved, abstracted away from specific implementation choices and\\nexperimental configurations. Elements that primarily involve dataset selection, hyperparameter\\ntuning, or engineering-level optimizations are excluded unless they induce substantive changes to\\nthe problem formulation, model structure, or learning objective. In practice, most papers yield one\\nor a small number of method units. Each extracted unit is further normalized into structured\\nmethodological attributes, including atomic meta-methods, which correspond to indivisible\\nmethodological elements, and composition-level patterns, which describe how multiple method\\nunits are combined within a single paper.\\n\\n\\nAfter extracting method units for all papers, we represent each paper p\\u2208\\ud835\\udcab~p\\\\in\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}}\\nby a vector embedding derived from its associated method units. Formally, let\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc33p=g\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb0p),\\\\mathbf{z}_{p}=g(\\\\mathcal{U}_{p}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udcb0p\\\\mathcal{U}_{p} denotes the set of extracted method units for paper pp and\\ng\\u200b(\\u22c5)g(\\\\cdot) is an embedding function that maps a set of method units to a fixed-dimensional\\nrepresentation.\\n\\n\\nTo induce higher-level research patterns, we first apply a nonlinear dimensionality reduction\\noperator\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc32p=UMAP\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc33p),\\\\mathbf{y}_{p}=\\\\mathrm{UMAP}(\\\\mathbf{z}_{p}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhich projects the high-dimensional embeddings into a lower-dimensional space while preserving\\nlocal semantic neighborhoods. We then perform density-based clustering on the reduced\\nrepresentations using DBSCAN, yielding a partition\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9e={C1,\\u2026,CM},\\\\mathcal{C}=\\\\{C_{1},\\\\dots,C_{M}\\\\},\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere each cluster Cm\\u2282\\ud835\\udcab~C_{m}\\\\subset\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}} corresponds to a coherent research pattern.\\n\\n\\nThese induced clusters serve as higher-level abstractions over individual papers, capturing\\nrecurring methodological structures that are reused across the literature. The resulting research\\npatterns form the basis for subsequent retrieval and composition.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2:  Offline knowledge graph construction in Idea2Story. Academic papers and their associated review artifacts are first anonymized and safety-filtered, then deconstructed into layered methodological representations. These layers capture complementary aspects of a paper, including its core research idea, domain context, high-level story skeleton, and packaging actions. The extracted elements are normalized into atomic method units and meta-methods, which are connected through composition and similarity relations. Reviewer feedback is incorporated as additional signals to refine relations and validate abstractions. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1.3 Knowledge Graph Construction\\n\\nBuilding on the extracted method units, we organize reusable methodological components into a\\nstructured knowledge graph that supports systematic method discovery and composition. While\\nindividual method units capture isolated algorithmic or modeling ideas, effective research methods\\nin practice typically arise from structured combinations of multiple method units. The knowledge\\ngraph provides a unified representation that explicitly encodes canonicalized method units,\\nmeta-methods, and their empirically observed composition relations in prior work.\\n\\n\\nFormally, we define the knowledge graph as a directed graph\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udca2=(\\ud835\\udcb1,\\u2130),\\\\mathcal{G}=(\\\\mathcal{V},\\\\mathcal{E}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere each node v\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb1v\\\\in\\\\mathcal{V} corresponds to a canonicalized method unit or a meta-method.\\nCanonicalization groups semantically similar method units across the corpus into shared\\nmeta-method abstractions, reducing surface-level variation while preserving core methodological\\nintent. As a result, nodes in the graph represent atomic or minimally indivisible methodological\\nelements that are reused across papers.\\n\\n\\nEdges in the graph encode composition relations between method units. For a given paper\\np\\u2208\\ud835\\udcab~p\\\\in\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}} with extracted method unit set \\ud835\\udcb0p\\\\mathcal{U}_{p}, we add directed edges\\nbetween pairs of method units (ui,uj)\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb0p\\u00d7\\ud835\\udcb0p(u_{i},u_{j})\\\\in\\\\mathcal{U}_{p}\\\\times\\\\mathcal{U}_{p} to indicate that\\nthey are jointly instantiated as part of the same methodological pipeline. These edges capture\\nempirical evidence of method compatibility observed in prior work, reflecting how different\\nmethod units are combined in practice rather than hypothetical or manually specified relations.\\n\\n\\nAggregating composition relations across the full corpus yields a graph structure that encodes both\\nmethodological abstraction and empirical compatibility. In particular, the graph captures two\\ncomplementary levels of structure: (i) reusable methodological elements represented as\\ncanonicalized method units and meta-methods, and (ii) composition constraints induced from\\nco-occurrence statistics in accepted papers. This separation allows Idea2Story to reason about\\nmethods at a higher level of abstraction than individual papers, while remaining grounded in\\nobserved research practice.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2 Online Research Generation.\\n\\nGiven a target research objective, Idea2Story treats method discovery as a graph-based retrieval and\\ncomposition problem over \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G}. The system retrieves relevant subgraphs and composes\\ncompatible method units by following connectivity constraints in the graph, producing candidate\\nresearch patterns that correspond to structured combinations of method units. These research\\npatterns serve as high-level methodological blueprints that bridge abstract research intent and\\nconcrete experimental design, enabling downstream planning, feasibility analysis, and end-to-end\\npaper generation.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2.1 Research Pattern Retrieval\\n\\nGiven a user-provided research idea expressed in natural language, we formulate research pattern\\nidentification as a structured retrieval problem over the knowledge graph \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G}. Let\\nqq denote the input research idea, and let \\ud835\\udc9e={C1,\\u2026,CM}\\\\mathcal{C}=\\\\{C_{1},\\\\dots,C_{M}\\\\} denote the set of\\nresearch patterns induced from the paper corpus. The goal is to rank patterns in \\ud835\\udc9e\\\\mathcal{C}\\naccording to their relevance to qq.\\n\\n\\nRather than relying on a single similarity metric, Idea2Story adopts a multi-view retrieval\\nformulation that aggregates complementary signals from different semantic abstractions. Formally,\\nfor each research pattern CmC_{m}, we compute a relevance score\\n\\n\\n\\ns\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)=\\u2211v\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb1\\u03bbv\\u200bsv\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q),s(C_{m}\\\\mid q)=\\\\sum_{v\\\\in\\\\mathcal{V}}\\\\lambda_{v}\\\\,s_{v}(C_{m}\\\\mid q),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udcb1={idea,domain,paper}\\\\mathcal{V}=\\\\{\\\\text{idea},\\\\text{domain},\\\\text{paper}\\\\} indexes the retrieval views,\\nsv\\u200b(\\u22c5)s_{v}(\\\\cdot) denotes a view-specific scoring function, and \\u03bbv\\\\lambda_{v} are fixed weighting\\ncoefficients that balance the contribution of different views.\\n\\n\\nIdea-level retrieval.\\n\\nAt the idea level, the system retrieves previously observed research ideas that are semantically\\nsimilar to the input query qq. Let \\u2110\\\\mathcal{I} denote the set of stored research ideas extracted\\nfrom the corpus, and let simidea\\u200b(q,i)\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{idea}}(q,i) denote a semantic similarity function\\nbetween qq and an idea i\\u2208\\u2110i\\\\in\\\\mathcal{I}. The idea-level score of a research pattern CmC_{m} is\\ncomputed by aggregating the similarity scores of ideas associated with the pattern:\\n\\n\\n\\nsidea\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)=maxi\\u2208\\u2110\\u200b(Cm)\\u2061simidea\\u200b(q,i),s_{\\\\text{idea}}(C_{m}\\\\mid q)=\\\\max_{i\\\\in\\\\mathcal{I}(C_{m})}\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{idea}}(q,i),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u2110\\u200b(Cm)\\\\mathcal{I}(C_{m}) denotes the set of ideas linked to pattern CmC_{m}.\\n\\n\\n\\nDomain-level retrieval.\\n\\nAt the domain level, the system interprets the input idea qq in terms of its underlying research\\ndomains and methodological themes. Let \\ud835\\udc9f\\\\mathcal{D} denote the set of research domains, and let\\nsimdomain\\u200b(q,d)\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{domain}}(q,d) measure the relevance between qq and domain d\\u2208\\ud835\\udc9fd\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}.\\nThe domain-level score of pattern CmC_{m} is computed as\\n\\n\\n\\nsdomain\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)=\\u2211d\\u2208\\ud835\\udc9f\\u200b(Cm)simdomain\\u200b(q,d)\\u200bw\\u200b(d,Cm),s_{\\\\text{domain}}(C_{m}\\\\mid q)=\\\\sum_{d\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}(C_{m})}\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{domain}}(q,d)\\\\,w(d,C_{m}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udc9f\\u200b(Cm)\\\\mathcal{D}(C_{m}) denotes the domains associated with pattern CmC_{m}, and w\\u200b(d,Cm)w(d,C_{m}) captures\\nempirical effectiveness signals derived from the knowledge graph.\\n\\n\\n\\nPaper-level retrieval.\\n\\nAt the paper level, the system retrieves papers whose technical content is semantically aligned\\nwith the input idea. Let \\ud835\\udcab\\u200b(Cm)\\\\mathcal{P}(C_{m}) denote the set of papers instantiating pattern CmC_{m}.\\nThe paper-level score is computed as\\n\\n\\n\\nspaper\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)=maxp\\u2208\\ud835\\udcab\\u200b(Cm)\\u2061simpaper\\u200b(q,p)\\u22c5\\u03b1\\u200b(p),s_{\\\\text{paper}}(C_{m}\\\\mid q)=\\\\max_{p\\\\in\\\\mathcal{P}(C_{m})}\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{paper}}(q,p)\\\\cdot\\\\alpha(p),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere simpaper\\u200b(q,p)\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{paper}}(q,p) measures semantic similarity between qq and paper pp,\\nand \\u03b1\\u200b(p)\\\\alpha(p) denotes a quality-related weight derived from peer review metadata.\\n\\n\\nThe final ranked list of research patterns is obtained by ordering patterns according to their\\naggregated multi-view relevance scores. Formally, we define\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9e\\u2217\\u200b(q)=RankCm\\u2208\\ud835\\udc9e\\u2061(\\u2211v\\u2208{idea,domain,paper}\\u03bbv\\u200bsv\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)),\\\\mathcal{C}^{*}(q)=\\\\operatorname{Rank}_{C_{m}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{C}}\\\\left(\\\\sum_{v\\\\in\\\\{\\\\text{idea},\\\\text{domain},\\\\text{paper}\\\\}}\\\\lambda_{v}\\\\,s_{v}(C_{m}\\\\mid q)\\\\right),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere patterns are sorted in descending order of the aggregated score.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2.2 Review-Guided Refinement\\n\\nAfter candidate research patterns are retrieved, Idea2Story refines them using an explicit\\nLLM-based review loop. In each iteration, a large language model is prompted to act as a reviewer\\nand evaluate the current research pattern along several predefined criteria, including technical\\nsoundness, novelty with respect to existing literature, and overall clarity of the problem\\u2013method\\nalignment. The reviewer produces both scalar judgments and concrete revision suggestions.\\n\\n\\nThe system then uses this feedback to update the research pattern in a targeted manner. When the\\nreview indicates insufficient novelty, the system modifies the pattern by recombining compatible\\nmethod units or introducing alternative realizations within the same pattern family. When the\\nreview identifies issues in feasibility or ambiguity in formulation, the system revises the problem\\ndefinition or method structure to improve consistency and executability. Each revised pattern is\\nre-submitted to the same review process, forming an explicit generate\\u2013review\\u2013revise loop.\\n\\n\\nTo prevent uncontrolled drift, only revisions that improve the reviewer scores are retained;\\notherwise, the system rolls back to the previous version. This process repeats until the reviewer\\njudges the pattern to be sufficiently novel, coherent, and technically plausible, or until further\\niterations no longer yield improvement. The output of this stage is a refined research pattern that\\nhas been iteratively vetted by an LLM-based reviewer and is suitable for downstream validation and\\npaper generation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"4 Experiments and Analysis\": \"\\n\\n4 Experiments and Analysis\\n\\nWe evaluate Idea2Story through a set of experiments focusing on its ability to extract reusable\\nmethodological structure and to generate high-quality research patterns from ambiguous user input.\\nOur experiments are conducted on a corpus of accepted papers from ICLR and NeurIPS over the past\\nthree years, including approximately 13K papers and their associated peer reviews, which serves as\\nthe foundation for all subsequent analyses. Based on this corpus, we first analyze the properties of the extracted method units to assess whether Idea2Story captures meaningful and reusable methodological abstractions. We then present qualitative demonstrations of research patterns instantiated as structured research stories, illustrating how the system transforms vague research intent into coherent and methodologically grounded research directions.\\n\\n\\n\\nCase 1: Method Unit Extraction Demo\\n\\n\\nPaper Title:\\nLearning Dynamics of LLM Finetuning\\nBase Problem:\\nUnderstanding how specific training examples influence model predictions during finetuning is challenging, particularly in large language models.\\nSolution Pattern:\\nDevelop a framework to analyze step-wise influence accumulation among potential responses during finetuning, providing insights into phenomena like hallucination and the squeezing effect in off-policy direct preference optimization.\\nStory:\\nReframe the understanding of LLM finetuning through the lens of learning dynamics, offering a unified interpretation of training behaviors and inspiring methods to enhance model alignment and performance.\\nApplication:\\nImproving alignment in large language models, enhancing finetuning strategies for better model performance, diagnosing and mitigating hallucination in AI systems.\\n\\nFigure 3: An example of a method unit extracted from an accepted paper, illustrating the separation of the base problem, solution pattern, and higher-level research story.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.1 Implementation Details\\n\\nTo further assess the effectiveness of Idea2Story in practical research ideation settings, we\\nconduct additional qualitative experiments on a small set of representative cases. Specifically,\\nwe evaluate three user-provided research ideas curated by an external collaborator. For each case,\\nIdea2Story generates research patterns using the GLM-4.7 (zeng2025glm) model as the underlying language backbone. As a baseline, we compare against direct LLM generation, where the same model is prompted to produce a complete research story without explicit pattern modeling or retrieval.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.2 Case Study: Method Unit Extraction\\n\\nWe present a representative case study to illustrate the behavior of the proposed method unit\\nextraction agent. Case 1 shows an example extracted from an accepted paper, where the system decomposes the full paper into a structured set of methodological elements.\\n\\n\\nAs shown in the example, the extracted method unit explicitly separates the underlying research\\nproblem, the core solution pattern, and the resulting research story. The Base Problem describes the core challenge addressed by the paper, namely understanding how individual training examples influence model behavior during finetuning, without depending on specific datasets or implementation details. The Solution Pattern summarizes the central methodological idea as\\nan analysis framework for step-wise influence accumulation, highlighting the key mechanism without\\nbinding it to a particular optimization setup or experimental configuration. Importantly, the extracted Story reframes the technical contribution at a higher level of\\nabstraction, connecting learning dynamics to broader phenomena such as hallucination and alignment\\nin large language models. This abstraction reflects how the method unit goes beyond algorithmic\\ndetails to capture the conceptual contribution of the paper. Finally, the Application\\nfield grounds the method unit by indicating downstream research and system-level implications,\\nwithout enumerating task-specific benchmarks.\\n\\n\\nThis example demonstrates that the extraction agent isolates reusable methodological structure while\\nfiltering out implementation-level details. By representing the paper as a coherent method unit\\nrather than a collection of experimental components, Idea2Story enables subsequent reuse,\\ncomparison, and composition of methodological ideas across papers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3 Knowledge Graph Analysis\\n\\nWe analyze the structure of the constructed knowledge graph to understand how extracted method\\nunits are distributed across papers and research domains. As illustrated in Figure 2, the graph\\nexhibits a clear hub-and-spoke structure, where a small number of high-frequency domains connect\\nto a large number of papers and research patterns. This reflects the uneven distribution of\\nresearch activity across domains, while also highlighting domains that function as central hubs\\nfor methodological reuse. Importantly, many research patterns are observed to connect multiple\\ndomains simultaneously, indicating that the extracted method units often capture methodological\\nabstractions that generalize beyond a single application area. In contrast, paper-level nodes are typically associated with a single domain, whereas pattern-level nodes frequently act as bridges between otherwise weakly connected domains. This structural separation suggests that the knowledge graph encodes two distinct levels of organization\\u2014instance-level\\n\\nFigure 4: Visualization of the knowledge graph substructure induced by high-frequency research\\ndomains.\\n\\n\\nresearch artifacts and reusable methodological abstractions\\u2014enabling Idea2Story to retrieve and compose research patterns at a higher level of abstraction rather than relying on domain-specific or paper-specific similarity alone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAspect\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIdea2Story Generated (IntentDiff)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLLM Direct Generated (EcoIntent)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTitle\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIntentDiff: Reframing E-commerce Intent Classification via Structural Evolution and Context-Aware Diffusion\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEcoIntent: A Context-Aware Multi-Granularity Agent for E-commerce Intent Understanding via Hierarchical Contrastive Learning\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbstract Focus\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReinterprets intent classification as a structural evolution process rather than static text classification. The approach leverages a diffusion-based framework to iteratively refine noisy query representations into precise intent labels, integrates product graph embeddings to ground predictions in e-commerce context, and introduces a discrete, context-aware tokenizer to handle long-tail domain vocabulary.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTargets improved intent classification performance by integrating heterogeneous behavioral context and hierarchical product knowledge.

Rather than\\nevaluating surface-level writing quality, the comparison focuses on the resulting research\\npatterns as methodological blueprints\\u2014i.e., how the generated ideas frame the research problem,\\nidentify gaps in prior work, and organize methodological components into a coherent approach. As shown in the table, Idea2Story tends to induce higher-level problem reformulation, transforming\\nintent understanding from a fixed classification task into a dynamic structural reasoning process.\\nThe resulting research pattern emphasizes generative refinement, structural priors, and evolving\\nrepresentations. In contrast, the direct LLM baseline largely operates within a conventional task\\nformulation, proposing a stronger system through the integration of additional components such as\\ncontext modeling and hierarchical objectives.\\n\\n\\nTo reduce evaluation bias, the generated research stories from both approaches are subsequently\\nassessed by an independent large language model (Gemini 3 Pro) (team2025gemma), which is not involved in either generation process. The evaluator is instructed to compare the outputs in terms of novelty, methodological substance, and overall research quality, without access to the generation method\\nused. Across all evaluated cases, the externally evaluated results consistently favor the outputs\\ngenerated by Idea2Story. In particular, the research stories produced by direct LLM generation tend\\nto remain at a high level of abstraction, with less concrete methodological grounding and reliance\\non relatively standard techniques. In contrast, Idea2Story-generated research patterns exhibit\\nclearer problem framing, more specific methodological structures, and stronger signals of novelty.\\n\\n\\n\", \"5 Future Work\": \"\\n\\n5 Future Work\\n\\nWhile Idea2Story focuses on grounding vague research intent into structured and high-quality research patterns, an important direction for future work is to extend this framework toward a fully closed-loop research generation pipeline. A promising extension is the integration of experiment-driven agents that can instantiate, validate, and iteratively refine generated research patterns through empirical feedback, including automated experimental design, dataset selection, and preliminary execution. Experimental outcomes can then serve as additional signals to refine the instantiated research stories, forming a feedback loop between method design and empirical validation. Beyond experimentation, future work may further explore how refined research patterns can be systematically translated into complete paper drafts, covering method descriptions, experimental results, and discussion sections. By grounding paper generation in empirically validated research patterns, such a system could move beyond surface-level text generation and provide more faithful, end-to-end support for executable and publishable scientific discovery.\\n\\n\", \"6 Conclusion\": \"\\n\\n6 Conclusion\\n\\nWe presented Idea2Story, a pre-computation\\u2013driven framework for autonomous scientific discovery that shifts literature understanding from runtime reasoning to offline knowledge structuring. By explicitly extracting reusable method units and organizing them into a continuously updated knowledge graph, Idea2Story enables research agents to reason over stable research patterns rather than repeatedly processing raw papers. Our qualitative analyses and comparative studies show that this design leads to research patterns with clearer problem reformulation, stronger methodological structure, and higher conceptual novelty than direct LLM generation. These results highlight the importance of explicit pattern modeling as a foundation for scalable and reliable autonomous research. Looking ahead, integrating Idea2Story with experimental agents to close the loop from abstract research patterns to validated empirical results represents a promising direction toward fully autonomous and trustworthy scientific discovery.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"}, \"bibliography\": {}, \"domain\": \"cs.CE\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"9115ba8e-7c5d-4db7-9460-32a6130096e2\", \"authors\": [\"Jiangen He\", \"Wen Lou\"], \"title\": \"How Disciplinary Partnerships Shape Research Landscape in U.S. Library and Information Science Schools\", \"abstract\": \"This study provides the first comprehensive empirical mapping of how organizational structures and research portfolios co-occur across U.S. Library and Information Science (LIS) schools.

Unlike disciplines with clearly delineated theoretical frameworks and methodological canons, LIS draws its intellectual foundations from diverse fields including computer science, cognitive psychology, sociology, communication studies, and education [Larivire2012, Zhu2016]. This theoretical and methodological eclecticism is not incidental but constitutive: LIS scholarship evolves in dialogue with and often in response to developments in adjacent disciplines [Cronin2008, Furner2015].\\n\\n\\nThis interdisciplinary character has profound implications for how LIS units are positioned within universities. As the field has evolved, particularly with the rise of digital technologies and data science, LIS schools have increasingly reorganized themselves, forming partnerships with computer science departments, communication schools, education colleges, or positioning themselves as standalone information schools [Wiggins2012, Wu2012]. These structural choices are consequential, influencing faculty recruitment patterns, resource allocation, curriculum development, and ultimately the research agendas pursued by these institutions [Martzoukou2017].\\n\\n\\nYet this same interdisciplinarity that enriches LIS intellectually also creates ambiguity about institutional positioning. From university administrators\\u2019 perspectives, the question \\u201cWhere does LIS belong?\\u201d has no obvious answer [vakkari2024characterizes]. Should information schools align with computer science to emphasize computational methods? Partner with communication to emphasize the social dimensions of information? Affiliate with education to foreground information literacy? Or maintain independence to preserve disciplinary autonomy? These decisions are rarely made on purely intellectual grounds; institutional politics, resource constraints, and historical contingencies all play roles [Dillon2012, Marchionini2008].\\n\\n\\nThe relationship between organizational structure and research direction is unlikely to be unidirectional. While structure may shape research by influencing collaboration networks, hiring priorities, and resource access [Salancik1978, Whitley2000], research interests also drive structural choices as schools position themselves to align with faculty strengths and emerging opportunities [Mintzberg1979]. Previous scholarship has acknowledged this reciprocal relationship in principle but has provided limited empirical evidence about how it manifests in LIS specifically [Ma2012, Wiggins2012]. The result is a gap in our understanding: we lack systematic documentation of whether and how organizational structures and research profiles co-occur in patterned ways across the LIS field.\\n\\n\\nUnderstanding these patterns carries significance for multiple stakeholders. For academic leaders and strategic planners, empirical evidence about how organizational positioning relates to research profiles can inform decisions about restructuring, mergers, or partnership formations [King2017]. For accreditation bodies and professional organizations, these patterns raise questions about whether unified standards make sense when schools pursue such different research agendas [Juznic2003]. For doctoral students and early-career faculty, knowing how organizational structure relates to research environment helps inform program selection and career planning [Sugimoto2011]. For the field broadly, documenting the relationship between institutional diversity and intellectual diversity addresses ongoing debates about LIS identity, coherence, and future viability [Bawden2008, Cronin2005].\\n\\n\\nThis study addresses this gap by providing the first comprehensive empirical mapping of organizational structures and research landscapes in U.S. Library and Information Science schools. Specifically, we investigate three research questions:\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nRQ1: What is the intellectual structure of LIS research in the U.S., and what foundational dimensions define its landscape?\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nRQ2: How does the organizational structure of LIS schools relate to the composition of their research portfolios?\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\n\\nRQ3: How have the research priorities of LIS schools evolved over the past 12 years (2013\\u20132024), and does organizational type influence these evolutionary trajectories?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis study makes three primary contributions. First, we provide comprehensive documentation of how 44 U.S. LIS schools are organized and what research they produce, covering 14,705 publications between 2013 and 2024 published by 1,264 faculty members. Second, we develop a research landscape mapping that identifies 16 distinct research themes and three foundational research dimensions (Library and Knowledge Organization, Human-Centered Technology, and Computing Systems), providing a shared vocabulary for discussing LIS\\u2019s intellectual diversity. Third, we reveal systematic patterns in how organizational structures and research profiles co-occur, that challenge simplistic narratives about the field\\u2019s transformation. It provides an essential empirical foundation for future work and discussion using mixed-method designs to investigate the mechanisms linking structure and scholarship.\\n\\n\", \"2 Literature Review\": \"\\n\\n2 Literature Review\\n\\n\\n2.1 Evolving Identity of LIS\\n\\nThe intellectual core of Library and Information Science has perpetually been defined by its struggle and synergy with interdisciplinarity [Bates1999]. The field\\u2019s theoretical foundation is not a single, stable paradigm but a dynamic and often contentious conversation between imported frameworks and native concepts.\\n\\n\\nTheoretically, LIS has oscillated between embracing its identity as a \\u201cmeta-discipline\\u201d\\u2014a connector of other fields\\u2014and seeking a unique, unifying theory of its own [Cronin2005]. Early anchors in social epistemology and information behavior have been supplemented, and sometimes challenged, by computational and socio-technical theories borrowed from computer science, social informatics, and science and technology studies [Larivire2012]. This has led to a rich but fragmented theoretical landscape where a study on algorithmic bias in search engines and an ethnographic study of a public library\\u2019s community role can sit under the same disciplinary umbrella, speaking different theoretical languages.\\n\\n\\nMethodologically, this theoretical diversity is mirrored by a dramatic expansion from its qualitative, user-study roots. While surveys, interviews, and historical analysis remain vital, the field has undergone a pronounced \\u201ccomputational turn.\\u201d[lou2021temporally] Bibliometrics, once a niche specialty, is now a mainstream methodology. Network analysis, natural language processing, and data mining are increasingly common, pushing LIS research closer to the data sciences[yang2025quantifying]. This methodological borrowing is a double-edged sword: it increases technical rigor and relevance to the digital age but also risks diluting the field\\u2019s distinctive human-centered methodological heritage.\\n\\n\\nIn terms of application and boundaries, LIS has aggressively expanded from its traditional home in libraries and archives [Sugimoto2011]. Its applications now prominently include health informatics, where it contributes to patient data management and consumer health information [chen2024you]; scholarly communication, where it studies the entire research lifecycle from peer review to open science [van2025scholarly]; and social media analysis, where it investigates misinformation and online communities [diaz2019towards]. This boundary-pushing work is the field\\u2019s greatest source of vitality but also its greatest identity crisis. The core question remains: Is LIS defined by its core object of study (\\u201cinformation\\u201d) or by its unique perspective on that object, and if the latter, what precisely is that perspective?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2.2 Organizational Anatomy of LIS Schools\\n\\nThe intellectual tensions within LIS are physically and administratively manifested in the organizational structures of its academic units[Sugimoto2011]. A significant body of internal LIS research has dissected these structures, revealing how they function as engines that shape the field\\u2019s future [Wu2025].\\n\\n\\nA primary focus has been on faculty and research performance. Studies consistently show that an LIS school\\u2019s organizational partnership is a powerful predictor of its research output. Schools partnered with computer science departments tend to publish more in conference proceedings, secure larger grants, and have higher per-faculty publication counts in computationally intensive areas. In contrast, standalone iSchools often boast greater research diversity but may face challenges in achieving critical mass in any one area[bowman2021similarities, wang2025ischools, shah2021ischool]. Faculty hiring patterns are a key mechanism here; a school merging with a communications department will naturally hire faculty with mass media expertise, thereby steering its research agenda toward social media and public opinion[zuo2019standing].\\n\\n\\nAnother critical area of study is curriculum, education, and student outcomes. The syllabus is a direct reflection of organizational identity. Research analyzing course catalogs finds that LIS programs embedded in computer science colleges require more programming and data science courses, while those in education colleges emphasize pedagogy and instructional design. This curricular differentiation directly impacts student pathways [zhang2022creating, weintrop2022ischools]. Graduates from technically-oriented programs are funneled into tech industry roles like UX research and data analytics, while graduates from more traditional or socially-oriented programs more often enter academic, public, or school libraries. This creates a feedback loop where alumni success in a sector reinforces the school\\u2019s strategic focus on it.[huang2025we]\\n\\n\\nFinally, research on leadership, strategy, and accreditation examines the forces that create these structures in the first place. Deans and directors operate under significant pressure, making strategic choices about partnerships to secure resources, enhance prestige, or ensure survival in a competitive university environment [corieri2024ischool, lou2018research]. Accreditation bodies, like the American Library Association, represent another structural force, attempting to uphold core professional competencies across wildly different organizational models\\u2014a tension that raises fundamental questions about whether a unified set of standards can or should apply to such a diverse ecosystem. [bowman2021similarities]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2.3 Institutional Research in LIS\\n\\nThe LIS field has increasingly turned its analytical tools upon itself, generating a multi-layered body of institutional research that documents its own evolution from global to individual scales.\\n\\n\\nAt the macro (global/country) level, bibliometric studies dominate. These large-scale analyses map the field\\u2019s growth, identifying the most prolific nations, the most cited journals, and the rise and fall of major research themes over decades. They reveal, for instance, the ascendancy of China as a major contributor to LIS research and the global shift from \\\"library\\\" to \\\"information\\\" as a central focus. However, these macro-studies often treat \\\"LIS\\\" as a monolith, aggregating data in ways that can conceal the rich organizational diversity underneath. [zheng2025understanding, Rehman2024, Dora2020]\\n\\n\\nAt the meso (institutional/cross-institutional) level, the research becomes sparser. While case studies of individual iSchools or comparative analyses of a handful of programs exist [shah2021ischool, wang2025ischools, Wu2025, Zhu2016, zuo2019standing], there is a significant gap in comprehensive, systematic studies. We lack a clear field-wide understanding of how different organizational models correlate with differentiated research portfolios, faculty demographics, and funding patterns. This level is crucial because it is at the institutional level that strategic decisions are made and intellectual identities are most visibly formed and sustained.[he2025academic]\\n\\n\\nAt the micro (individual/faculty) level, research focuses on the lived experience of the field\\u2019s practitioners. This includes studies of doctoral students\\u2019 dissertation topics, which serve as a leading indicator of the field\\u2019s future direction. It also includes analyses of faculty publishing habits, collaboration networks, and professional identity, exploring how individual scholars navigate the competing demands of interdisciplinary work and departmental expectations [zhu2024dependency]. This level reveals the human impact of the macro trends and meso-level structures, showing how large-scale shifts in the field play out in the daily work and careers of its members [li2022worldwide, wiles2024teaching].\\n\\n\\nIn all, we have a rich understanding of LIS\\u2019s intellectual diversity and a growing, though less systematic, understanding of its organizational diversity . We also have robust theories from higher education studies suggesting these two should be linked [TorresZapata2019]. However, the crucial bridge\\u2014a comprehensive, empirical mapping of how specific organizational structures co-occur with specific research profiles\\u2014remains largely unbuilt. Our study addresses this by uniting these three strands: it uses the methods of macro-level institutional research to conduct a meso-level analysis of organizational types, in order to explain the intellectual identity and diversification of the field.\\n\\n\\n\", \"3 Methods\": \"\\n\\n3 Methods\\n\\nFour major steps compose the workflow of the study (Figure 1), including collecting data of LIS schools, faculty data in the schools over years, publication data of the faculty members from 2013 to 2024, and data analysis pipeline.\\n\\n\\nFigure 1: A workflow of the study, including the data collection and analysis.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1 School Data Collection\\n\\nWe used the list of Best Library and Information Studies Programs from U.S. News and World Report (ranked in 2021) to select schools for this study, in which there are 55 schools. We examine these 55 schools by visiting their website to code their organizational structure. (Step 1 in Figure 1). There are four types of schools that have been excluded from this study. (1) We excluded schools that offer only an LIS degree program without an academic unit of LIS (three schools). These programs may be emerging ones, but most of them do not have full-time faculty for the LIS program. (2) We exclude schools that do not have a school website (one school) or no faculty information online (two schools). (3) We exclude one school that cannot be identified in web archives (Step 2 in Figure 1). 4) We exclude four schools that do not have faculty publication data in Dimension (Step 3 in Figure 1). Eventually, 44 out of 55 schools were included in the study.\\n\\n\\nWe categorized the schools\\u2019 organizational types. We took into account the history of the school to code their organizational type. For example, the LIS school at the University at Albany\\u2013SUNY is currently aligned with Cybersecurity and Homeland Security, but it had been associated with computer science for many years before they formed the new school. Eventually, we identified five major types of academic structures among LIS schools. Table 1 shows a complete list of schools for the five types.\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nInformation: LIS units are standalone and independent, not sharing academic administration with any other discipline.

The most reliable approach involves identifying faculty members from institutional websites and subsequently gathering their publications by name, which presents a significant methodological challenge. Given that faculty recruitment patterns may reflect shifts in institutional research priorities, we employed the Internet Archive\\u2019s Wayback Machine to capture faculty information at multiple temporal points. We collected faculty data annually to characterize institutional research focus changes over three-year periods. For instance, faculty information from 2014 was used to identify publications from 2013, 2014, and 2015. Consequently, we gathered faculty data from 2014, 2017, 2020, and 2023 to cover publications spanning 2012 to 2024 (see Step 2 in Figure 1). For each institution at each data collection point, we began by searching the current faculty directory URL in the Wayback Machine and extracted faculty information from archived website snapshots. We utilized Python scripts to collect snapshot URLs for faculty data extraction. However, many directory page URLs had changed over time, requiring manual identification of the correct archived faculty directory pages. We employed institutional website URLs in the Wayback Machine to locate faculty directory page snapshots. When institutional websites had undergone structural changes, we navigated back to university-level snapshots to identify the appropriate school-level archives. In rare instances where university website URLs had changed completely, we utilized search engines to identify historical university website URLs. Through this systematic approach, we successfully collected archived snapshots of all LIS school faculty directory pages in 2014, 2017, 2020, and 2023. The snapshot URLs follow the standard Internet Archive format: \\u201chttps://web.archive.org/web/{timestamp}/{directory_page_URL}\\u201d.\\n\\n\\nAll faculty names were collected with the assistance of browser-use\\u2019s AI feature.\\nA standardized prompt was issued for each directory page to extract faculty information (see prompt in the Appendix).\\nWe manually validated all extracted records and consolidated them into a single table.\\nWe examined the data for abnormalities, such as implausible faculty entries in a given year or dramatic year-over-year changes.\\nAlthough some turnover is expected, substantial shifts are uncommon.\\nWhen anomalies were detected, we repeated data collection for that year manually.\\nAfter establishing broad consistency across years, we randomly selected one of the four collection points for detailed manual verification of accuracy.\\nIn total, we compiled 3,379 faculty records across the four collection points (745 in 2014, 823 in 2017, 805 in 2020, 1,006 in 2023), including tenure-track, tenured, and non-tenure-track full-time faculty, while excluding adjunct professors, visiting professors, and graduate students.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3 Publication Data Collection\\n\\nNext, we collected the publications of all faculty members (Step 3 in Figure 1).\\nWe used the Dimensions Analytics API (DSL v2) because it provides broad coverage of journals and conferences and supports author disambiguation.\\nBy merging faculty records across years by name and organization, we obtained 1,683 unique faculty records.\\nFor each faculty member, we first issued an exact-name query constrained by institutional affiliation: search researchers where first_name = \\\"{firstname}\\\" and last_name = \\\"{lastname}\\\" and research_orgs.id = \\\"{grid_id}\\\" return researchers, where {grid_id} is the GRID identifier of the faculty member\\u2019s university.\\nIf the exact query returned no result, we relaxed the first-name constraint to a fuzzy match using first_name \\u223c\\\\sim \\\"{firstname}\\\" while keeping the affiliation filter.\\nWhen multiple researcher records were returned for a faculty member, we retrieved recent publications for each candidate and manually identified those working in Library and Information Science or closely related areas.\\nUsing this procedure, 1,264 of 1,683 faculty were matched by name and organization.\\nOf these, 31 were manually disambiguated across multiple returned profiles.\\n\\n\\nWith the researcher IDs, we collected 23,001 publications for the 1,264 faculty members.\\nAmong these, 19,726 were unique publications.\\nWe queried publications using search publications where researchers = \\\"{dimension_id}\\\" return publications.\\nWe retained only records with Document Type in \\u2019RESEARCH_ARTICLE\\u2019, \\u2019CONFERENCE_PAPER\\u2019, \\u2019RESEARCH_CHAPTER\\u2019, \\u2019REVIEW_ARTICLE\\u2019, yielding 16,761 articles.\\nWe detected duplicate entries across preprint and published versions and removed them.\\nThe final deduplicated set contained 14,740 unique publications.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4 Research Theme Modeling and Visualization\\n\\nTo identify and analyze research themes in the field of Library and Information Science (LIS), we employed a state-of-the-art topic modeling approach that leverages transformer-based language models. Specifically, we used BERTopic [grootendorst2022bertopic], which combines the power of BERT-based text embeddings with clustering techniques to discover coherent and interpretable research themes from academic publications. Although BERTopic labels its clusters \\u201ctopics\\u201d, we refer to them as \\u201cresearch themes\\u201d because their granularity is closer to that of domain-level areas in LIS.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4.1 Embedding Generation\\n\\nWe extracted semantic representations from the titles and abstracts of all 14,705 publications using the SPECTER2 model [singh2023scirepeval], which is specifically designed for scholarly document representation. This model captures semantic relationships between academic papers more effectively than general-purpose language models. For each paper, we concatenated the title and abstract text with the SPECTER2 separation token and generated a 768-dimensional embedding vector that encodes the semantic content of the paper.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4.2 Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering\\n\\nThe high-dimensional embeddings were then processed through a multi-step pipeline for identifying research themes:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nDimensionality Reduction: We applied UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) to reduce the embeddings to 10 dimensions while preserving the semantic relationships between papers. This step facilitates more efficient clustering and visualization.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nHierarchical Clustering: We utilized Agglomerative Clustering to group the publications into 16 coherent research themes. This approach was selected after experimentation with HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), as it provided more balanced and interpretable theme clusters for our dataset. We experimented with different number of themes from 10 to 20. We use two basic rules to huristically determine the number of themes. First, the number of themes should be enough to cover all the major research themes without merging major themes into one theme, for example, \\\"Library Science\\\" and \\\"Metadata and Archives\\\" are two major related themes, but they should not be merged into one theme. Second, the themes should not be too similar to each other that can be merged into one theme. We found 16 themes is a good balance between these two rules.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\n\\nTheme Representation: To generate interpretable representations of each theme, we employed a Class-based TF-IDF (c-TF-IDF) transformation combined with Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) to extract distinctive keywords while ensuring diversity in the theme representations.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.\\n\\nTheme Labeling and Refinement\\nThe initial model identified 16 themes. After examining the themes, two small non-LIS topics were identified: \\u201cQuantum Communication\\u201d and \\u201cAtmospheric Chemistry\\u201d.\\nAlthough these topics included publications by LIS-affiliated faculty, they were not central to LIS research and involved only a few authors from LIS schools. We excluded 35 publications from these topics.\\nThe final dataset contained 14,705 publications. The final model contained 14 distinct research themes. For improved interpretability, we enhanced the theme labels using a GPT-4o based system. For each theme, we provided the model with a sample of 500 publication titles and requested concise, descriptive labels along with subtopics and a brief summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4.3 Visualization\\n\\nWe created several visualizations to facilitate the exploration and understanding of the LIS research landscape:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nResearch Landscape Map: Using UMAP, we reduced the embeddings to 2 dimensions for visualization purposes. Each point in the resulting map (Figure 2) represents a publication, colored according to its assigned theme. The size of each point corresponds to its citation count. The landscape map provides an intuitive overview of the proximity and boundaries between different research areas in LIS.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nTheme Distribution by School Type: To analyze the relationship between organizational structure and research focus, we created visualizations showing the distribution of research themes across different types of LIS schools (Figure 4).\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\n\\nUniversity Positioning: We mapped individual universities in the research landscape based on the aggregated embeddings of their faculty publications (Figure 5) by using principal component analysis (PCA), revealing institutional specializations and positioning within the broader LIS research ecosystem.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.\\n\\nTrend Analysis: To visualize the evolution of institutional research profiles, we aggregated the 16 research themes into three foundational dimensions (see Section 4.2). For each university, we calculated the annual proportion of publications in each dimension from 2013 to 2024. We restricted this analysis to 37 schools that met the criteria of having at least 50 publications and data spanning at least 5 years. To identify robust long-term trends amidst year-to-year volatility, we applied linear regression to these annual proportions for each dimension. We then used the regression models to predict the composition of research for the start year (2013) and end year (2024). These predicted start and end points were mapped onto a ternary coordinate system, with arrows connecting the 2013 position to the 2024 position to visualize the magnitude and direction of the shift. This approach allows for a clear depiction of how schools are repositioning themselves within the triangular conceptual space defined by the field\\u2019s three pillars. To categorize these evolutionary trajectories, we analyzed the change in the proportional share of each dimension (LKO, HCT, CS) between the predicted 2013 and 2024 coordinates. We defined a significance threshold of 5 percentage points based on a heuristic evaluation. This threshold provides a robust margin to distinguish meaningful strategic shifts from noise or minor fluctuations. Additionally, sensitivity testing indicated that this cutoff effectively captures the primary evolutionary trends, yielding a reasonable number of significant moves across the dataset without over-interpreting marginal changes. For each dimension, a university was classified as moving \\u201cToward\\u201d that dimension if its share increased by \\u22655%\\\\geq 5\\\\%, and \\u201cAway from\\u201d it if its share decreased by \\u22655%\\\\geq 5\\\\%. A university\\u2019s trajectory could be assigned multiple directional labels (e.g., matching both \\u201cAway from LKO\\u201d and \\u201cToward HCT\\u201d).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe resulting topic model and visualizations provide a comprehensive view of the current LIS research landscape in the United States, enabling analysis of how different organizational structures correlate with research themes and temporal evolution.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.5 Statistical Analysis\\n\\nTo statistically evaluate differences in research topic composition across the five organizational school types, we employed Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA).\\nThe topic distribution data (the proportion of publications in each research theme for each university) differs from standard Euclidean space data due to its compositional nature (proportions sum to 1). To address this, we applied the Centered Log-Ratio (CLR) transformation to the topic proportions.\\nAitchison distance (Euclidean distance on CLR-transformed data) was then calculated between all pairs of universities to form a distance matrix.\\nWe performed a global PERMANOVA test to assess whether significant overall differences existed among the groups.\\nFollowing a significant global result, we conducted pairwise PERMANOVA comparisons between all school type pairs.\\nWe employed Fisher\\u2019s Protected Least Significant Difference (LSD) procedure for pairwise comparisons to balance Type I and Type II error rates.\\n\\n\\n\", \"4 Results\": \"\\n\\n4 Results\\n\\n\\n4.1 Faculty and Publication Data\\n\\nAs shown in Table 2, faculty size varies substantially by organizational type.\\nComputer units have the largest faculties on average (mean 39.2; median 36.0).\\nInformation units are next (mean 28.2; median 22.0), followed by Communication (mean 18.3; median 20.0) and Education (mean 12.6; median 11.0).\\nArt&Science units are the smallest (mean 10.6; median 9.0).\\n\\n\\nPublication output also differs greatly across school types.\\nComputer exhibits the highest per-faculty productivity (mean 25.9; median 16.0; std 28.3).\\nInformation has the greatest total output (sum 8,837) with moderate per-faculty rates (mean 15.7; median 8.0; std 18.0).\\nCommunication shows mid-range rates (mean 14.2; median 9.0; std 15.8).\\nArt&Science and Education display lower per-faculty publication rates (means 10.6 and 10.9, respectively).\\n\\n\\nTable 2: Publications and Faculty Statistics by Academic Structure Type\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPublications (per faculty)\\nFaculty (per unit)\\n\\n\\nType\\nSum\\nMean\\nMedian\\nStd\\nSum\\nMean\\nMedian\\nStd\\n\\n\\nArt&Science\\n564\\n10.6\\n6.0\\n10.2\\n53\\n10.6\\n9.0\\n3.7\\n\\n\\nCommunication\\n1820\\n14.2\\n9.0\\n15.8\\n128\\n18.3\\n20.0\\n5.9\\n\\n\\nComputer\\n5068\\n25.9\\n16.0\\n28.3\\n196\\n39.2\\n36.0\\n19.2\\n\\n\\nEducation\\n957\\n10.9\\n6.0\\n11.8\\n88\\n12.6\\n11.0\\n6.9\\n\\n\\nInformation\\n8837\\n15.7\\n8.0\\n18.0\\n563\\n28.2\\n22.0\\n19.2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.2 Research Themes\\n\\nTo address RQ1 regarding the intellectual structure and foundational dimensions of the field, we first analyze the research themes emerging from publications. Our theme modeling analysis of 14,705 LIS faculty publications between 2013 and 2024 reveals the interdisciplinary nature of Library and Information Science research in the United States. The model identified 16 distinct research themes as shown in Table 3 and Figure 2. The table shows the label, count, and representation of each theme. The labels were generated by the GPT-4o using the publication title in each theme and adjusted by the authors. The representation is a list of keywords that are most representative of the theme detected by the c-TF-IDF algorithm. The subtopics of each research theme were identified by the GPT-4.1 based system. The count is the number of publications in the theme. The research landscape map (Figure 2) shows the distribution of publications in the 16 themes encoded by different colors. The landscape map provides an intuitive overview of the proximity and boundaries between different research themes in LIS.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: Research landscape of Library and Information Science in the United States from 2013 to 2024. Each point is a publication positioned by semantic similarity. Colors denote the 16 research themes; dense regions and larger labels mark higher volume. Neighboring clusters indicate intellectual proximity.\\n\\n\\nDrawing on the landscape visualization, topic modeling results, representative publications, and the field\\u2019s inherent interdisciplinarity, we identify three research dimensions that constitute the main pillars of LIS.\\nThese dimensions offer a higher-granularity framework for characterizing research interests and research portfolios across the field.\\nWe organize the dimensions and their constituent themes as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nLibrary and Knowledge Organization: Library Science, Metadata and Archives, Scholarly Communication\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nHuman-Centered Technology: Health Informatics and Technology, Social Media, Human-Computer Interaction, Digital Privacy and Well-Being, Computing Education, Health Information Behavior, Information Access and Equity, Extended Reality\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nComputing Systems: Biomedical Informatics, AI and Data Science, Cybersecurity, Information Retrieval, Autonomous Systems\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn Figure 2, traditional LIS sits at the top center with \\u201cLibrary Science\\u201d adjacent to \\u201cMetadata and Archives\\u201d and \\u201cScholarly Communication,\\u201d forming a coherent Library and Knowledge Organization dimension. To the right-center is the Human-Centered Technology dimension, including \\u201cHuman-Computer Interaction,\\u201d \\u201cDigital Privacy and Well-Being,\\u201d \\u201cInformation Access and Equity,\\u201d \\u201cComputing Education,\\u201d and \\u201cSocial Media.\\u201d This dimension also encompasses \\u201cExtended Reality\\u201d and health-related themes (\\u201cHealth Informatics and Technology\\u201d and \\u201cHealth Information Behavior\\u201d), which cluster in connected regions. Computing Systems dimension, occupying the lower-right and technical fronts, includes \\u201cCybersecurity,\\u201d \\u201cAutonomous Systems,\\u201d \\u201cInformation Retrieval,\\u201d \\u201cBiomedical Informatics,\\u201d and \\u201cAI and Data Science.\\u201d\\n\\n\\nLibrary and Information Science is upheld by the three foundational research groups:\\nLibrary and Knowledge Organization is the discipline\\u2019s heritage and focuses on ensuring knowledge is systematically described, curated, and made discoverable;\\nHuman-Centered Technology keeps the field rooted in people\\u2019s information needs and societal impact, guiding the ethical and inclusive design and use of technologies; and\\nComputing Systems pushes the frontier by developing the algorithms, data infrastructures, and intelligent systems that enable large-scale information access and analysis.\\nTogether these dimensions balance information, human values, and technical innovation, defining the holistic scope of LIS [Saracevic1999, Bates1999, olson2009timelines, Dillon2012, bawden2022introduction].\\n\\n\\nTable 3: The 16 Research Themes Identified in LIS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLabel\\n\\n\\nCount\\n\\n\\nRepresentation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubtopics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\nLibrary Science\\n\\n\\n1593\\n\\n\\nlibrary, librarians, services, literacy, collections, community, education, outreach, policy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLibraries, Librarianship, Information services, and Education\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\nBiomedical Informatics\\n\\n\\n1275\\n\\n\\nbiomedical, ontology, protein, genes, diseases, clinical, semantic, drugs, trials\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBiomedical text mining, Ontologies, Clinical informatics, and Drug discovery\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\nAI and Data Science\\n\\n\\n1255\\n\\n\\nai, machine learning, data, visualization, graphs, modeling, networks, prediction, analytics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMachine learning, Data visualization, Network science, and Predictive analytics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\nMetadata and Archives\\n\\n\\n1231\\n\\n\\nmetadata, archival, curation, preservation, provenance, collections, standards, repositories, reuse\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDigital libraries, Curation, Preservation, and Metadata standards\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\nHealth Informatics and Technology\\n\\n\\n1100\\n\\n\\nhealth, clinicians, caregivers, telehealth, mhealth, devices, interventions, aging, patients\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTelehealth, mHealth, Aging and caregiving, and Health IT design\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\nSocial Media\\n\\n\\n1029\\n\\n\\nsocial media, misinformation, platforms, tweets, facebook, covid, public, news, communities\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSocial media, Misinformation, Online communities, and Credibility\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\nHuman-Computer Interaction\\n\\n\\n987\\n\\n\\nhci, design, usability, participation, accessibility, users, experiences, games, inclusion\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHuman-centered design, Accessibility, Inclusive design, and User experience\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\nDigital Privacy and Well-Being\\n\\n\\n903\\n\\n\\nprivacy, online safety, harassment, well-being, youth, consent, surveillance, policy, ethics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrivacy, Online safety, Digital well-being, and Policy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\nComputing Education\\n\\n\\n818\\n\\n\\nstudents, programming, curriculum, learning, assessment, cs education, analytics, diversity, pedagogy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCS education, Data science curriculum, Diversity, and Learning analytics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\nCybersecurity\\n\\n\\n806\\n\\n\\ncybersecurity, threats, cloud, iot, attacks, detection, blockchain, edge, resilience\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCybersecurity, IoT security, Cloud security, and Threat detection\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\nInformation Retrieval\\n\\n\\n790\\n\\n\\nretrieval, search, queries, relevance, recommendation, ranking, evaluation, user behavior, web\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSearch systems, Recommender systems, Evaluation, and User engagement\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\nHealth Information Behavior\\n\\n\\n657\\n\\n\\nhealth, information seeking, patients, vaccines, misinformation, behaviors, communities, support, public\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHealth information seeking, Vaccination, Public health communication, and Misinformation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\nInformation Access and Equity\\n\\n\\n651\\n\\n\\naccess, equity, digital divide, inclusion, libraries, underserved, community, justice, policy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInformation equity, Access policy, Digital inclusion, and Community engagement\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\nScholarly Communication\\n\\n\\n604\\n\\n\\ncitations, journals, publications, impact, open access, authorship, disciplines, science, metrics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScientometrics, Research evaluation, Collaboration, and Open science\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\nExtended Reality\\n\\n\\n514\\n\\n\\nvr, ar, xr, accessibility, blind, interaction, haptics, children, learning\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXR/VR/AR, Assistive technology, Interaction techniques, and Inclusive design\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\nAutonomous Systems\\n\\n\\n454\\n\\n\\nrobots, trust, autonomy, human-robot interaction, vehicles, agents, transparency, teamwork, safety\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHuman-robot interaction, Trust, Autonomous vehicles, and Agent-based systems\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 3: Publication trends across LIS research themes from 2014 to 2023.

The figures in the first row show the publication trends of LIS in total and the three overarching LIS research dimensions. Total publication output increased steadily over this period with a normalized annual growth rate of n=4.8%n{=}4.8\\\\%, rising from approximately 937 publications in 2013 to around 1,500 in 2024. Human-centered Technology is the fastest-growing research group (n=6.7%n{=}6.7\\\\%), followed by Computing Systems (n=4.5%n{=}4.5\\\\%) and Library and Knowledge Organization (n=1.5%n{=}1.5\\\\%).\\nThe fastest-growing research areas demonstrate expansion: Extended Reality leads with n=13.1%n{=}13.1\\\\% growth, followed by Digital Privacy and Well-Being (n=9.9%n{=}9.9\\\\%), Health Information Behavior (n=9.6%n{=}9.6\\\\%), AI and Data Science (n=9.4%n{=}9.4\\\\%), and Computing Education (n=8.7%n{=}8.7\\\\%).\\nThese emerging areas show clear upward trajectories.\\nStrong but more moderate growth characterizes Social Media (n=7.7%n{=}7.7\\\\%), Autonomous Systems (n=6.8%n{=}6.8\\\\%), while Health Informatics and Technology (n=4.9%n{=}4.9\\\\%), Biomedical Informatics (n=4.6%n{=}4.6\\\\%) continue steady expansion. Human\\u2013Computer Interaction exhibits modest growth (n=3.3%n{=}3.3\\\\%), maintaining relatively stable output levels.\\nTraditional foundational areas demonstrate slower but consistent growth patterns: Library Science (n=2.3%n{=}2.3\\\\%), Cybersecurity (n=2.1%n{=}2.1\\\\%), Library and Knowledge Organization (n=1.5%n{=}1.5\\\\%), Scholarly Communication (n=1.0%n{=}1.0\\\\%), and Metadata and Archives (n=0.6%n{=}0.6\\\\%), though Information Retrieval shows a slight decline (n=\\u22122.4%n{=-}2.4\\\\%) and Information Access and Equity experiences modest contraction (n=\\u22121.2%n{=-}1.2\\\\%).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3 Organizational Structure and Research Profiles\\n\\nTurning to RQ2, this section examines how these research themes are distributed across different organizational types to understand the relationship between structure and scholarship.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3.1 Distributional Patterns\\n\\nThe relationship between organizational structure and research focus reveals distinct specialization patterns across different academic organizational structures (Figure 4).\\nAs illustrated in the stacked bar chart, each organizational type exhibits a unique research profile, with clear variations in the proportion of research themes.\\n\\n\\nFigure 4: Distribution of research themes across different types of LIS schools. This visualization reveals how organizational positioning influences research focus, with clear specialization patterns emerging across different school types.\\n\\n\\nEducation schools demonstrate the strongest commitment to traditional library-oriented research, with Library Science constituting 30.8% of their publications.\\nMetadata and Archives represent another substantial focus area at 19.8%, reinforcing their dedication to information organization and preservation.\\nThese schools also devote considerable attention to Computing Education (8.6%), indicating the education-oriented research focus of the Education schools.\\n\\n\\nComputer schools present the most technically oriented research profile among all organizational types.\\nTheir focus on Biomedical Informatics (15.9%) and Privacy and Security (10.1%) significantly exceeds the LIS-wide averages, reflecting deep engagement with computational methods and data-intensive research domains.\\nNotably, Library Science accounts for merely 2.7% of their research output, representing the lowest proportion among all structural types and a fundamental shift toward technology-driven research.\\n\\n\\nCommunication schools maintain a more balanced research agenda that bridges traditional and emerging information concerns.\\nLibrary Science remains prominent at 26.8%, while Metadata and Archives (8.3%), Social Media research (8.0%), and Information Access and Equity (7.5%) constitute additional focal areas.\\nThis distribution suggests a research orientation that encompasses both institutional information practices and social dimensions of information phenomena.\\n\\n\\nArt&Science schools display similar research emphases as Communication schools. They demonstrate engagement with both traditional information science concerns and data-intensive research domains.\\nLibrary Science comprises 23.8% of their work, while Information Retrieval (13.1%) and Health Information Behavior (12.1%) feature prominently.\\n\\n\\nIndependent Information schools exhibit the most diversified research portfolio, with no single theme dominating their scholarly output.\\nTheir research spans multiple domains relatively evenly, though AI and Data Science (10.6%) emerges as areas of particular concentration.\\nThis balanced distribution suggests that Information schools cultivate broad interdisciplinary connections. Worth noting is that since the majority of the schools are Information schools, it is not surprising they present more diverse research profiles.\\n\\n\\nThe visual comparison across organizational types in Figure 4 reveals how structural positioning fundamentally shapes research agendas.\\nComputer schools clearly drive technical specializations, Education schools sustain traditional library science while incorporating education technologies, and Communication and Art&Science schools foster research on information behavior and social media.\\n\\n\\nTo statistically validate these observed differences, we performed a PERMANOVA using Aitchison distance. The global test revealed a statistically significant difference in research topic composition across the five school types (pseudo-F=1.77F=1.77, p=0.002p=0.002). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons using Fisher\\u2019s Protected LSD indicated that Computer Science-affiliated schools differ significantly from Education (p=0.001p=0.001), Information (p=0.003p=0.003), Communication (p=0.008p=0.008), and Art & Science (p=0.037p=0.037) schools. Additionally, Information schools significantly differ from Education schools (p=0.036p=0.036). Other pairwise comparisons were not statistically significant (p>0.05p>0.05). These results confirm that the \\u201cComputer\\u201d affiliation marks a distinct departure in research identity, while subtle differences also exist between other types of schools.\\n\\n\\nThese patterns observed from the visualization along with the statistical evidence demonstrate that organizational structure serves not merely as an administrative arrangement but as a powerful force shaping the intellectual direction of LIS scholarship.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3.2 Individual School Positioning\\n\\nSince schools of the same type may exhibit substantial variation, we further examine each university\\u2019s research positioning by analyzing the similarity between its publications and those of other institutions.\\nThe university positioning visualization (Figure 5) illustrates how individual institutions situate themselves within the broader research landscape through principal component analysis (PCA).\\nWe employ PCA because its linear nature enables meaningful comparisons of proximity across institutions.\\nThe visualization reveals several notable patterns in the research landscape.\\n\\n\\nFigure 5: Positioning of LIS schools in the research landscape. Each node represents a university, with node color indicating academic structure type. Proximity between institutions reflects similarity in research profiles, revealing clusters of schools with shared research emphases.\\n\\n\\nFirst, Computer schools (shown in green) form a distinct cluster on the right side of the plot, indicating their shared emphasis on computational and technical research areas.\\nSecond, Information schools (shown in blue) form the largest and most dispersed cluster, which reflects their diverse research portfolios spanning both traditional and emerging information science topics.\\nThird, schools from different organizational types cluster together too, suggesting that research focus can transcend structural boundaries. For instance, several Education schools position near Communication schools.\\nFourth, considerable within-type variation exists, demonstrating that organizational structure alone does not determine research direction. For example, University of California\\u2013Los Angeles and Long Island University Post are both Education schools but they are located in different parts of the plot. These patterns reveal that while organizational structure influences research priorities, other factors such as individual institutional cultures, faculty expertise, and strategic choices may also play important roles in shaping research identities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.4 Temporal Evolution and Bidirectional Movement\\n\\nFinally, to answer RQ3 about the evolution of research priorities and the influence of organizational type, we trace the trajectories of schools and school types over the 12-year period.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.4.1 Directional Shifts\\n\\nFigure 6 presents the aggregate temporal evolution (linear regression with 95% confidence interval) of research priorities across the five organizational types of LIS schools. Each arrow represents a school type\\u2019s collective trajectory within the research landscape defined by the three foundational dimensions. Computer schools exhibit a clear shift toward HCT and away from CS research, with slight movement away from LKO and relatively low uncertainty in their trajectories. Information schools also moved toward HCT and CS while retreating from LKO. Communication and Art&Science schools follow similar trajectories to Information schools, though Art&Science schools demonstrate stronger movement toward CS. Education schools display a unique evolutionary pattern, moving toward LKO and CS while shifting away from HCT. While these aggregate patterns reveal meaningful differences across organizational types, substantial heterogeneity exists within each category. Thus, we also examined individual school trajectories.\\n\\n\\nFigure 6: Temporal evolution of research priorities for five types of LIS schools from 2013 to 2024 using ternary plots. Each arrow represents an institution\\u2019s trajectory within the research landscape defined by three foundational dimensions. The band shows 95% confidence interval. The three vertices of each triangle represent 100% concentration in HCT, LKO, and CS, respectively.\\n\\n\\nSimilarly, Figure 7 visualizes the temporal evolution of research priorities for 37 LIS schools from 2013 to 2024 using ternary plots. Each arrow represents a school\\u2019s trajectory within the research landscape defined by three foundational dimensions. The percentage changes in research dimension shares of the schools can be found in Appendix.\\n\\n\\nFigure 7: Ternary plots depicting the directional shifts of LIS schools across three research dimensions from 2013 to 2024. Each of the six panels represents schools exhibiting a specific movement pattern. Each school is represented by an arrow connecting its starting position to its ending position, with colors indicating organizational structure type.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe most profound shift is a migration away from LKO. Panel a2 (Moving Away from LKO) captures the largest grouping, comprising 21 schools (56.8% of the sample) that reduced their relative focus on LKO. This migration spans all organizational types, with arrows originating near the LKO vertex and extending toward the HCT-CS axis, confirming the narrative of a fundamental transition in LIS research. However, the data challenges the assumption of a unidirectional drift. Panel a1 (Moving Toward LKO) reveals a counter-trend, where 14 schools increased their relative focus on LKO. Many of these institutions, already heavily invested in HCT and CS, appear to be re-balancing their portfolios by renewing their engagement with traditional library and information science foundations.\\nPanel b1 (Moving Toward HCT) highlights another primary trend: 19 schools shifting their portfolios toward Human-Centered Technology. This group largely overlaps with those moving away from LKO (Panel a2). Notably, many arrows in this panel are long and terminate near the HCT vertex, suggesting a radical transformation toward HCT rather than a subtle adjustment.\\n\\n\\nPanel c1 (Moving Toward CS) shows a smaller but significant cluster of 14 schools deepening their engagement with CS. Conversely, Panel c2 (Moving Away from CS) shows 11 schools retreating from CS research. These counter-movements are particularly visible among Computer-affiliated schools and schools with heavy investments in CS, which were among the most CS-focused in 2013. This suggests that even computationally intensive schools are seeking more balanced research portfolios.\\n\\n\\nIn summary, the evolution of LIS research is characterized not by a uniform technological drift, but by a complex dynamic of diversification and strategic re-balancing between human-centered, computational, and traditional information priorities. However, it is unclear the strategy of schools moving away and toward different dimensions. Thus, we analyze the pattern combinations of directional shifts to better understand the strategies in the next section.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.4.2 Pattern Combinations\\n\\nAnalysis of how directional movements combine reveals that LIS schools are following diverse evolutionary strategies (Figure 8). The most common pattern is moving Away from LKO. The pattern combined with Toward HCT (16 schools, 43.2%) and Toward CS (10 schools, 27.0%) form the most common evolutionary strategies in LIS. Within this broad trend of distancing from traditional foundations (LKO), a subgroup of 5 schools (13.5%) pursues a \\u201cDual-Diversification\\u201d strategy, simultaneously moving Away from LKO while expanding into both HCT and CS.\\n\\n\\nFigure 8: UpSet plot showing the distribution of schools across different research trend patterns within the three research dimensions.\\nThe horizontal bar chart (left) displays the size of each trend category, while the vertical bar chart (top) shows the composition of intersections by school types.\\nThe dot matrix (bottom right) indicates which trend patterns are combined in each intersection, with connected dots representing combinations.\\nTrend categories include movements toward or away from LKO, HCT, and CS.\\n\\n\\nIn contrast, two other primary evolutionary strategies involve a renewed emphasis on LKO: Away from CS + Toward LKO and Away from HCT + Toward LKO (both 8 schools, 21.6%). These patterns represent distinct pathways for schools re-engaging with LKO. Other salient strategies include Away from HCT + Toward CS (6 schools, 16.2%) and Away from CS + Toward HCT (5 schools, 13.5%). These disparate trajectories underscore that LIS schools are not undergoing a uniform transformation, but rather differentiating into specialized profiles through targeted strategic shifts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"5 Discussion\": \"\\n\\n5 Discussion\\n\\nThe Diversification of LIS and the Question of Disciplinary Coherence\\n\\nOur finding that LIS schools pursue concentrated yet divergent evolutionary strategies speaks directly to longstanding debates about disciplinary coherence and fragmentation [Bawden2008, Cronin2005]. Previous scholarship has expressed concern that LIS risks developing into disconnected subfields as schools pursue computational, social, or traditional library-focused research without shared intellectual foundations [Furner2015]. Our evidence suggests a more nuanced reality: while schools do specialize along distinct dimensions, they do so through systematic patterns rather than chaotic fragmentation. The bifurcation between Human-Centered Technology and Computing Systems pathways among schools leaving traditional LIS may reflect what [whitley2000intellectual] described as the \\u201corganizational fragmentation\\u201d typical of fields with high task uncertainty and low mutual dependence [vakkari2024characterizes, astrom2008formalizing]\\u2014multiple viable approaches exist to studying information phenomena, and schools choose based on resource dependencies and institutional contexts rather than a single disciplinary logic.\\n\\n\\nHowever, the persistence of Library and Knowledge Organization research across all organizational types, combined with the substantial \\u201creturn to foundations\\u201d pattern, challenges declinate narratives. This pattern aligns with [lou2021temporally] observation that information organization remains conceptually central even as methods evolve. The question is not whether LIS will survive computational transformation, but rather how effectively the field integrates new capabilities while preserving distinctive expertise that other disciplines cannot easily replicate.\\n\\n\\n\\nOrganizational Embeddedness and Research Autonomy\\n\\nThe asymmetric clustering patterns we observed\\u2014particularly the tight convergence of Computer schools versus the dispersion of independent Information schools\\u2014can be understood through resource dependence theory [Salancik1978]. Schools partnering with powerful disciplines like computer science gain access to infrastructure, funding networks, and legitimacy, but these benefits come with constraints on research autonomy. Our finding that Computer schools cluster tightly in computationally-intensive research space suggests that resource dependencies shape not just what research is feasible, but what research becomes normative within those institutional contexts.\\n\\n\\nYet resource dependence alone cannot explain our temporal findings. The observation that over half of Computer schools moved away from pure Computing Systems research (while maintaining computational orientation in other dimensions) suggests schools exercise agency in navigating structural constraints. This aligns with recent organizational scholarship emphasizing that embedded actors can strategically decouple from institutional pressures [glaser2018changing]. Computer schools may satisfy Computer Science partnership expectations through faculty hiring and infrastructure sharing while carving out distinctive research niches in computational social science or health informatics that differentiate them from generic Computer Science departments.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Human-Centered Technology Ascendancy\\n\\nPerhaps our most striking finding is that Human-Centered Technology, not Computing Systems, emerged as LIS\\u2019s dominant growth vector. This pattern contradicts conventional wisdom equating \\u201cdata science\\u201d with computational methods broadly, and challenges assumptions that LIS schools must compete with Computer Science departments on systems research to remain relevant. We propose three complementary explanations for HCT\\u2019s prominence. First, path dependence: LIS\\u2019s historical emphasis on user-centered librarianship and information behavior research provides intellectual and methodological foundations that translate more readily into human-computer interaction, social computing, and digital privacy research than into algorithms or systems architecture. Schools building on existing strengths may achieve higher quality output than those attempting to compete in areas where they lack comparative advantage. Second, labor market differentiation: As Computer Science departments flood markets with systems-oriented graduates, LIS programs may find better placement outcomes by preparing graduates who combine technical competence with deep understanding of human information needs\\u2014a skill combination Computer Science programs rarely emphasize. Student demand follows employment opportunities, creating feedback loops that reinforce HCT investment. Third, funding landscape evolution: Major funding agencies increasingly prioritize \\u201csocially-relevant computing\\u201d and \\u201chuman-AI interaction\\u201d over pure systems research (NSF\\u2019s focus on \\u201cAI for Social Good\\u201d, NIH\\u2019s emphasis on human-centered health IT) [tomavsev2020ai, NIH2025]. LIS schools may be responding rationally to these incentive structures.\\n\\n\\n\\nImplications for LIS Education and Accreditation\\n\\nOur findings raise challenges for accreditation bodies and professional organizations assuming uniform standards across organizationally diverse schools. If Computer schools produce 25.9 publications per faculty member focused heavily on computational methods while Education schools produce 10.9 publications per faculty emphasizing information literacy and pedagogy, can a single set of accreditation standards meaningfully assess both? Current ALA accreditation focuses on professional competencies rather than research profiles, but faculty expertise necessarily shapes what students learn.[salaba202321st]\\nThe field faces a choice: embrace organizational diversity by developing multiple accreditation pathways recognizing different institutional missions, or insist on core competencies that all graduates must demonstrate regardless of school type. The former risks fragmentation and loss of professional identity; the latter may impose unrealistic expectations on schools with limited resources.\\n\\n\\n\\nLimitations and Future Directions\\n\\nOur descriptive analysis documents co-occurrence patterns but cannot establish whether organizational structure shapes research, research drives structural choices, or both co-evolve. Our U.S.-focused sample may not generalize internationally, and publication-based measures exclude teaching, service, and professional impact. Future research should examine mechanisms linking structure to research: Do Computer Science partnerships influence outcomes through hiring, infrastructure, or disciplinary norms? Do different structures produce graduates with distinct competencies and career outcomes? Longitudinal case studies of reorganization events could provide causal insights our cross-sectional approach cannot.\\n\\n\\n\", \"6 Conclusion\": \"\\n\\n6 Conclusion\\n\\nThis study provides the first comprehensive empirical mapping of how organizational structures and research portfolios co-occur across U.S. Library and Information Science schools. By analyzing 14,705 publications from 1,264 faculty members across 44 institutions, we have established a research landscape framework organized around three foundational dimensions that offers a shared vocabulary for understanding LIS\\u2019s intellectual diversity. Our findings reveal that organizational positioning shapes but does not determine research trajectories: Computer schools cluster tightly in computationally-intensive research, yet most are pivoting toward Human-Centered Technology and Library and Knowledge Organization; independent Information schools demonstrate the greatest portfolio diversity; and Education schools uniquely maintain engagement with traditional library science foundations. Most significantly, the temporal analysis reveals that LIS schools pursue a small number of coherent strategic pathways, with Human-Centered Technology instead of Computing Systems emerging as the field\\u2019s primary growth vector. The intellectual diversity documented here may represent adaptive capacity rather than fragmentation, positioning different schools to serve distinct research profiles and to respond to varied institutional demands. The question facing LIS is whether this diversity will be deliberately cultivated as a source of collective strength or whether competitive pressures will force convergence.\\n\\n\", \"7 Data Availability Statement\": \"\\n\\n7 Data Availability Statement\\n\\nThe faculty data can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18396782.

These mobile robotic systems are increasingly utilized in diverse domains such as agriculture, logistics, surveillance, environmental monitoring, and search and rescue operations. As these robots operate in complex, dynamic, and often unpredictable environments, there is a growing need to enhance their autonomy to perform tasks with higher accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability.\\n\\n\\nOne of the critical factors in achieving greater autonomy in mobile robotic systems is the effective use of knowledge. Mobile robots require comprehensive and precise knowledge about their environment, tasks, actions, and inherent capabilities to make informed decisions and execute tasks successfully across different contexts. Traditionally, this knowledge has been encoded in algorithms and static databases, which often lack the flexibility and scalability needed to handle the dynamic nature of real-world scenarios.\\n\\n\\nTo address these limitations, the concept of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) has emerged as a powerful tool for knowledge representation and reasoning. KGs provide a structured and semantically rich framework for organizing information, enabling both the representation of complex relationships and efficient algorithms for knowledge retrieval and reasoning. Integrating KGs into mobile robot systems can enhance their capability to perform these tasks autonomously by providing real-time situational awareness, contextual understanding, and decision support.\\n\\n\\nDespite these advantages, the development and implementation of KGs in mobile robotic systems present several challenges, including data integration from various sensors and sources, real-time knowledge updating, or multi-agent interaction.\\n\\n\\nThis paper aims to develop a comprehensive methodology for applying KG to existing ROS 2 based robotic systems using a \\u201dbrownfield\\u201d approach. Our goal is to enhance the explainability of the robot\\u2019s operations during various stages and to leverage this knowledge for informed decision-making processes.\\n\\n\\nTo this end, we provide the following contributions:\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nA detailed description of each step of the methodology, specifying the required inputs and the process to achieve the desired outputs to ensure clarity and precision in executing each phase effectively.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nSoftware tools to apply the described methodology to any ROS 2 based robotic system.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nA working example describing the application of the proposed methodology to Aerostack2 [2], a ROS 2 open-source framework to design and control aerial robotic systems.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI-A Related work\\n\\n\\nMobile robotic systems have seen significant advancements with the integration of knowledge-based systems, which enhance their decision-making and adaptability in dynamic environments. Various approaches have been explored in this domain, each one leveraging distinct methodologies and technologies to improve robotic autonomy and efficiency. This section delves into the diverse landscape of mobile robotic systems incorporating knowledge-based systems, highlighting key innovations, methodologies, and their respective contributions to the field.\\n\\n\\nCognitive architectures are comprehensive, computational frameworks designed to model the structures and processes of human cognition. These architectures serve as blueprints for understanding and replicating the intricacies of human thought, encompassing perception, memory, reasoning, and learning. They provide a unified platform for developing intelligent agents capable of performing complex tasks, offering significant advancements in fields ranging from robotics to human-computer interaction.\\n\\n\\nSOAR [4], was the first cognitive architecture integrated into real robots and used with multiple robots [1]. Its basic architecture is established by representing the state of an environment through a graph composed of discrete objects and continuous properties. This allows for a set of predicates to be independent and fixed within the architecture, while the decisions regarding which predicates should be extracted are determined by the specific task that an agent must perform [5].\\n\\n\\nACT-R [8] models human cognition by integrating symbolic and subsymbolic processing. Symbolic processing includes declarative memory, which stores knowledge as chunks (data and facts) with labels (slots), and procedural memory, which holds production rules in \\u201dif-then\\u201d statements to guide behavior based on current goals. Subsymbolic processing operates using a connectionist model, resolving conflicts by selecting the chunk with the highest activation level, determined by past utility and context relevance. Through cycles of perception, cognition, and action, ACT-R adapts to changing environments and tasks, effectively storing and managing knowledge.\\n\\n\\nLIDA [3], provides adaptation and continuous learning by utilizing a multilayer working memory system. Each layer within this system has a distinct purpose and stores various types of information: perceptual, declarative, memory, and procedural. Active working memory serves as the interface that connects all these layers, allowing for the manipulation of stored information. LIDA employs a distributed representation where information is encoded through the activation patterns of artificial neural networks, offering a robust mechanism for adapting to dynamic environments.\\n\\n\\nAside from cognitive architectures, other systems focus more specifically on concrete knowledge representation methods. These methods, used in modern advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and neural networks, often emphasize structured data storage, pattern recognition, and internal learned representations.\\n\\n\\nThe proposed ontology structure by [9] comprises three hierarchical layers where each layer regards more specific knowledge than the former: a metaontology that represents generic concepts, an ontology schema defining domain-specific knowledge, and an ontology instance that captures specific information about individual objects and their attributes. These layers are organized into six classes: Feature, Object, Actor, Space, Context, and Action, each with varying levels of detail. This structure provides a comprehensive, object-oriented, and frame-based language while the hierarchical structure that allows for knowledge to be effectively used through reasoning.\\n\\n\\nThe system proposed in [6] utilizes a knowledge-based system that integrates explicit expert knowledge with implicit learned knowledge, allowing the system to update its model based on the acquired information continuously. Through a knowledge acquisition module explicit knowledge provided by the operator is captured and converted into machine-readable form and then integrated with implicit knowledge. Implicit knowledge is captured by training a model to imitate the adjustments made by the operator, ultimately leading to full automation of robot programming. By learning from the operator\\u2019s adjustments, the system enhances its flexibility, adaptability, and performance, addressing the challenges of industrial robot programming and improving overall efficiency in production processes.\\n\\n\\nKnowledge Graphs (KG) were first introduced in [10] and later popularized by Google, and have evolved significantly, becoming powerful tools for structuring and managing complex relationships between data in various fields, including autonomous systems and robotics. In [7], authors discuss the use of KGs in enhancing robot manipulation tasks. They introduce a multi-layer knowledge-representation model that incorporates various elements such as scenes, objects, agents, tasks, actions, and skills. This hierarchical structure allows for a more nuanced understanding of manipulation tasks compared to traditional flat representations. The authors propose a heterogeneous graph-embedding method that assigns different weights to various relations within the KG to enhance reasoning capabilities. This approach allows the system to differentiate the significance of different connections, facilitating more nuanced reasoning about how various factors influence manipulation tasks.\\n\\n\\nCompared to traditional cognitive architectures, KGs offer a more flexible and scalable approach to representing information. While cognitive architectures are highly specialized in replicating human-like reasoning and learning, they are limited in adaptability across various tasks or domains. KGs, in contrast, provide a dynamic, interconnected representation of entities and their relationships, allowing for more granular, real-time information querying and updating.\\n\\n\\n\", \"II METHODOLOGY\": \"\\n\\nII METHODOLOGY\\n\\n\\nFigure 1: A full overview of the described methodology. Circles represent each step described in the proposed methodology while rectangular boxes contain the outcomes of each step.\\n\\n\\nThe proposed methodology\\u2019s objective is to integrate KGs into ROS 2 systems providing a structured approach for leveraging the full potential of KGs, thus enabling more informed decision-making and improved mission performance in diverse ROS 2 based applications. This methodology is composed of several key steps: defining initial and target conditions, structuring tasks and sub-tasks, planning their sequence, representing task-related data in a KG, and designing the mission using a high-level language. Each step builds on the previous one, ensuring a cohesive process from initial setup to final execution. A full overview of the methodology is shown in Figure 1.\\n\\n\\n\\nII-A Definition\\n\\n\\nIn the definition step, initial conditions of the mission and expected outcomes are defined. This foundational step involves a thorough understanding of the mission\\u2019s goals and constraints, providing a clear vision of the desired outcomes. This step aims to establish a baseline against which the subsequent steps will be measured, ensuring that all efforts align with the ultimate mission objectives.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII-B Structuring\\n\\n\\nThe structuring step involves breaking down the mission into a detailed list of tasks necessary to achieve the defined target conditions. Each task is further subdivided into sub-tasks, with a focus on identifying and specifying the inputs and outputs associated with each sub-task, helping to understand essential activities, their interconnections, and decision points necessary for mission success. These inputs and outputs form the foundational elements necessary for a robust mission and will be mapped to the KG in a later step.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII-C Planning\\n\\n\\nOnce the tasks and sub-tasks are defined, the planning step requires establishing a valid sub-tasks ordering. This ordering should reflect a logical sequence that ensures all prerequisites are met before moving on to subsequent tasks. The primary goal in this step is to verify that the proposed sequence will effectively lead to the achievement of the mission\\u2019s target conditions as outlined in the definition step. A well-ordered plan serves as a roadmap for the subsequent stages, facilitating smooth execution and integration.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII-D Representation\\n\\n\\nThe representation step involves mapping the inputs and outputs of each sub-task to a KG representation. This step is critical for translating the relevant data identified through the task list into a form that can be effectively utilized within the KG framework. By aligning the inputs and outputs with the KG, it is ensured that the necessary information is available and properly organized for efficient querying and control.\\n\\n\\n\\nII-D1 Knowledge Extraction\\n\\nTo apply this methodology to any given ROS 2 based system, it is essential to design a data extraction method tailored to the system\\u2019s specific architecture, data sources and domain ensuring accurate and efficient information retrieval.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII-D2 Concept Design\\n\\nDuring the concept design step, the designer should define how the data will be represented as distinct entities and identify the relationships that connect these entities in the KG. Accurately mapping the data to the KG is essential to ensure that the KG properly represents the system\\u2019s components and their interactions. This alignment is crucial for the system\\u2019s decisions and actions to be consistent with its overall goals.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII-D3 Knowledge Mapping\\n\\nIn this phase, mechanisms are developed to transform raw data into a structured format compliant with the entities and relationships defined in the concept design stage. Given that the methodology is designed to be applied to any ROS 2 system, it is essential to customize these mechanisms to fit the specific system in use.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII-E Mission Design\\n\\n\\nWith the KG structure established, a high-level language is used to specify the mission during this step, including detailed control sequences and queries to interact with the KG. This enables the robot to execute the mission autonomously, with continuous mapping of inputs and outputs to the KG to adapt to changes and make informed decisions. Additionally, during this step, the designer should validate that the specified mission produces the outcomes defined in the definition step.\\n\\n\\n\", \"III ROS 2 KG Implementation\": \"\\n\\nIII ROS 2 KG Implementation\\n\\n\\nOne of the most relevant parts of the methodology is the representation step, which involves the knowledge representation within the KG. To deal with the issues that arise from the handling of knowledge, we have developed different ROS 2 modules that can be used to integrate knowledge graphs into an existing ROS 2 based system. These modules fulfill three main functions:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nKnowledge Base: A ROS 2 node that is in charge of storing the KG data. This node allows for inserting, querying, and deleting both nodes in the KG and edges between them. Additionally, these KG nodes can also store numerical values in terms of properties, which can be quite useful in the robotics domain.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nKnowledge Extractors: These components are different ROS 2 nodes in charge of interfacing with the current robotic system to be able to extract the relevant knowledge to be added to the KG. Those ROS 2 nodes subscribe to the different available topics and process the published data to generate knowledge. Additionally, they also handle data already contained in the KG to generate new knowledge.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\n\\nKnowledge Retrievers: These components allow to query the KG about the entities contained within it and the relationships between them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn terms of software architecture, the knowledge base ROS 2 node centralizes all the information related to the system, while the extractor and retriever ROS 2 nodes interact with it in an N-to-1 fashion during the execution of a given mission.\\n\\n\\nAdditionally, to handle multi-agent missions, the software generates a local KG for each agent and then merges them into a single KG ensuring there are no duplicate entities. This strategy allows each drone to perform independent missions, reducing read and reaction times. For example, when two drones share airspace, the shared KG benefits mission execution by including entities such as the operator\\u2019s position or flight status. Furthermore, the drones can infer new knowledge, such as the relative position between them (e.g., \\u201dclose\\u201d)\\n\\n\", \"IV USE CASE: SEARCH AND RESCUE SCENARIO\": \"\\n\\nIV USE CASE: SEARCH AND RESCUE SCENARIO\\n\\n\\nIn this section, the objective is to test the proposed methodology and the software tools developed during this work in a multi-drone search and rescue mission.\\n\\n\\nThe original robotic system that we will improve using KGs is Aerostack2. Aerostack2 is an open-source software framework designed to create autonomous multi-robot aerial systems. Its modular architecture and multi-robot orientation make it a versatile platform-independent environment capable of addressing a wide range of capabilities for autonomous operation. ROS 2, on the other hand, is an evolution of the popular Robot Operating System (ROS), designed to overcome the limitations of its predecessor. It provides tools, libraries, and conventions for building complex robotic systems and supports multiple programming languages, making it accessible to a wide variety of developers.\\n\\n\\nThe presented use case involves a mission where a set of drones must locate a target in an environment. This mission will be simulated in a Gazebo environment as shown in Figure 2, with the drones autonomously executing the mission using Aerostack2. Knowledge extractors specifically tailored for Aerostack2 will be employed as described in Section III and Figure 3 to enable efficient knowledge handling, integrating the KG capabilities into Aerostack2. This setup will demonstrate how the drones, powered by the advanced knowledge representation and decision-making processes, can effectively carry out the mission in a simulated scenario.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: The Gazebo simulation environment.\\n\\n\\nFigure 3: A graphical view of the application of the methodology to enhance Aerostack2. Green components are the ones introduced to the system through the application of the methodology, while blue ones are related to Aerostack2. Knowledge extraction is allocated in each one of the agents, while the knowledge base and the knowledge retrievers are centralized.\\n\\n\\nDefinition Stage: The mission objective is to inspect a specific area and determine the location of a desired object. The requirements are two drones that can execute autonomous flights, able to perceive their environment, and locate the object of interest. Additionally, the drones must have the capability to continuously monitor the state of their battery and their own location.\\n\\n\\nThis mission aims to evaluate the behavior of the KG both when a single agent knowledge is introduced and when the knowledge expected by multiple agents is integrated into a unified graph. This evaluation will allow us to determine the efficiency and effectiveness of the KG in situations with varying levels of complexity and coordination among multiple autonomous agents.\\n\\n\\nStructuring Stage: The mission can be divided into two main tasks: traversing a defined area and searching for an object, in addition to the tasks responsible for the continuous monitoring of the drones. The full list of identified tasks and sub-tasks is presented in Table I.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTask\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSub-task\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTraverse a defined area\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDetermine the current position of the agent\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCurrent position of each drone\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDetermine the required route to cover the remaining area\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCurrent position of each drone\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRemaining path to cover the area\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSearch and localization of the object\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCapture environmental information\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUse onboard cameras\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRecognize the desired object in the camera image\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCamera image\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLabel the image as contains or does not contain the object\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDrone supervision\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBattery status\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHigh or low level\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelative position between drones\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClose or not close\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMaintain position or move\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNavigation status\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLanded/Flying\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable I: Tasks and sub-tasks identified for the mission consisting of locating a person in an environment.\\n\\n\\nPlanning Stage: Initially, each drone operates independently. The first task is to check its battery status to ensure mission continuity. This check must be performed periodically throughout the mission; if a low battery level is detected, an emergency landing must be carried out if the drone has already taken off, or the takeoff must be prevented if it has not. Additionally, the other drone will take on the responsibility of inspecting the entire area.\\n\\n\\nAfter verifying the battery, the drone will take off and head to its inspection area, where it will start sweeping the zone. If it detects the individual, it will send a signal and wait for the other drone to approach so that they can send the individual\\u2019s coordinates to the operator. Conversely, if the drone does not locate the individual but receives a signal from the other drone, it will halt its trajectory and proceed to the indicated position.\\n\\n\\nFinally, if neither drone locates the individual, both will complete the inspection of their respective areas and return to the origin station, where they will proceed to land.\\n\\n\\nRepresentation Stage:\\n\\n\\n1.\\n\\nKnowledge Extraction: With the necessary parameters and information for successful mission execution determined by an expert technician, the next step is to extract and maintain this knowledge. Utilizing Aerostack2, we can subscribe to relevant topics like position and battery status, ensuring that these data are continuously updated and readily available for accurate and reliable mission execution.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.\\n\\nConcept Design: The identified entities in the KG are listed in Table II. Since the relevant knowledge to be stored is related to the current state of each drone, the most important edges between are the ones connecting the drone to the person to indicate if it has located the person, those linking a drone to a status entity to describe its current activity, and the edges linking drones to other drones to indicate proximity and avoid collisions.

This involves converting the information into entities and relationships that the graph can support. After completing this step, the KG state in the initial situation defined in the mission is shown in Figure 4.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 4: Initial state of the KG. It represents both drones in their respective home stations, with their batteries highly charged and ready to begin the search and rescue mission.\\n\\n\\nMission Design Stage: The planned mission is translated into Python using the tools provided by Aerostack2 and leveraging the capabilities of the KG to perform queries and monitor the current status of the mission at all times.\\nA rule-based system is used, which analyzes sensitive data through queries and generates consequences. Table IV outlines some examples of queries during the mission.

Figure 5 below shows the knowledge graph when the person has been located.\\n\\n\\nFigure 5: After locating the person, the KG should represent the fact that the two drones are close to each other, that one of them has located the person, and that both of them are still flying.\\n\\n\", \"V CONCLUSIONS\": \"\\n\\nV CONCLUSIONS\\n\\n\\nThe proposed methodology for implementing knowledge graphs in ROS 2 systems offers a robust framework for enhancing knowledge management and decision-making in autonomous missions. By systematically defining, structuring, planning, and representing mission-critical tasks, and by tailoring data extraction methods to specific systems, this approach ensures accurate and efficient integration of knowledge graphs. This integration enables more sophisticated data handling and analysis, ultimately improving the system\\u2019s ability to make informed decisions autonomously. Through this methodology, robotic systems can achieve greater reliability, adaptability, and performance in complex mission scenarios.\\n\\n\\nOne of the primary challenges of the proposed methodology is that it places the responsibility on the user to manually design how perceived information is mapped to nodes and edges in the knowledge graph. This task requires careful consideration of how system data, such as sensor readings or mission status, should be represented in the graph structure. While this approach provides flexibility, it can also be complex and time-consuming, as it requires a deep understanding of both the system and the knowledge graph to ensure accurate and meaningful representation.\\n\\n\\nThe practical application of this methodology is demonstrated through a mission to locate a person using drones, implemented within the Aerostack2 framework. By employing the proposed steps, from defining mission objectives to mapping data onto a knowledge graph, the system was able to effectively coordinate drone operations and enhance situational awareness. The structured representation of tasks and the tailored data extraction facilitated precise control and real-time decision-making. This implementation underscores the methodology\\u2019s potential to improve the operational capabilities of autonomous systems, showcasing its effectiveness in a real-world scenario and highlighting its versatility in handling complex missions within the Aerostack2 framework.\\n\\n\\nFuture work could focus on enhancing the methodology and software components by developing new tools to automate the defined steps, thereby streamlining the entire process. Additionally, incorporating support for reasoning methods beyond rule-based approaches, such as probabilistic or machine learning-based reasoning, could improve decision-making capabilities. Experimenting with different knowledge graph implementations would also be valuable to identify the most efficient solutions for real-time computation, further enhancing the system\\u2019s performance and responsiveness.\\n\\n\"}, \"bibliography\": {\"[1]\": \"\\n[1]\\nD.

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [18] and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [9] have achieved high-fidelity rendering, with 3DGS in particular becoming the mainstream choice for its real-time rendering capability. However, both methods require densely captured training images, which are often difficult to obtain, and they tend to produce artifacts at extrapolated viewpoints, namely those outside the interpolation range of the training views. These limitations hinder their use in downstream applications such as autonomous driving simulation and free-viewpoint user experiences.\\n\\n\\nRecent work has explored addressing artifacts in extrapolated view rendering with 3DGS. Existing approaches fall into two categories: adding regularization terms during training or augmenting supervision views using generative models. The regularization terms are often derived from 3D priors [48, 52, 10, 50, 32], or additional sensors [21], but they are typically hand-crafted and limited to specific scene types. Moreover, their lack of hallucination capability further restricts their applicability.\\nIn leveraging diffusion models (DMs), some approaches fine-tune them with paired data, e.g., by using sparse LiDAR inputs or extrapolated renderings with artifacts to generate refined images. Many of these methods train on domain-specific datasets, such as those for autonomous driving [41, 36, 20, 35], which inevitably compromises the generalization ability of DMs. More recently, Difix3D+ [37] fine-tunes SD Turbo [25] on a wider range of 3D datasets, improving generalization. However, the substantial effort required to curate 3D data and the high fine-tuning cost make this approach time-consuming and expensive to extend to other DMs.\\nAn alternative line of work seeks to improve extrapolated rendering without fine-tuning, typically by providing extrapolated renderings as guidance during the denoising step. This preserves the generalization capacity of DMs trained on large-scale data, but such methods still lag behind fine-tuned approaches that are specifically adapted to the task.\\n\\n\\nGiven the generalization\\u2013fidelity trade-off, we ask: can extrapolated view rendering be improved with DMs without sacrificing generalization? To address this challenge, we focus on fine-tuning-free methods and enhance their effectiveness for NVS extrapolation. This is achieved with our proposed 2D\\u20133D interleaved refinement strategy combined with per-pixel confidence guidance for fine-tuning-free image refinement. Specifically, given a trained 3DGS, we sample an extrapolated viewpoint, render the 2D image, refine it with a 2D image diffusion model (IDMs), and integrate the refined image back into the 3D scene by updating the 3DGS before proceeding to the next viewpoint.\\nThis interleaved 2D-3D refinement ensures that previously enhanced views inform subsequent 2D refinements and improve multi-view consistency. Importantly, we introduce a confidence-guided 2D refinement, where a per-pixel confidence map rendered from the 3DGS highlights regions requiring further improvement by the 2D DM. This contrasts with previous training-free methods that rely solely on rendering opacity, leaving the DM to identify artifact regions on its own. While our confidence guidance could in principle be applied to video diffusion models (VDMs), advanced video backbones are typically more computationally expensive and use temporal down-sampling, which prevents the direct use of per-pixel guidance. We show that our 2D\\u20133D interleaved optimization strategy achieves consistent refined images without relying on VDMs.\\n\\n\\nOur contribution can be summarized as follows: 1) We propose a simple yet effective approach for enhancing extrapolated 3DGS rendering without the need for fine-tuning DMs, featuring a 2D\\u20133D interleaved refinement strategy and per-pixel confidence guidance. 2) Our method is compatible with various DMs and preserves generalization across diverse scene contents. 3) Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing fine-tuning-free methods and achieves comparable or even superior performance to training-based methods.\\n\\n\", \"2 Related Work\": \"\\n\\n2 Related Work\\n\\nNumerous works have made efforts on improving quality of NVS. In this section, we will discuss related works in NVS and 3D reconstruction. Furthermore, we will explore efforts that improve NVS quality by incorporating priors from geometry, physics or generative models.\\n\\n\\nNovel View Synthesis: \\nNVS aims to generate photorealistic images of a scene from novel viewpoints. Early methods primarily relied on traditional image-based rendering techniques, such as Light Field Rendering [14], Image-Based Rendering [28], and Multi-Plane Image [55, 30]. These approaches typically interpolate between existing views and are often limited by dense input imagery and struggle with complex occlusions. The advent of deep learning revolutionized NVS, led by two major paradigms: NeRF [18] and 3DGS [9]. NeRF implicitly represents a scene and achieves high-quality results, but its training and rendering speeds are slow. In contrast, 3DGS offers rapid training and real-time rendering. However, a significant limitation of 3DGS is the occurrence of visual artifacts in extrapolated views, which are viewpoints far from the training data. These artifacts compromise the realism and geometric fidelity of the synthesized images. Mitigating these artifacts is the focus of this paper.\\n\\n\\nNVS with Geometry Priors: \\nTo enhance the robustness of NVS models and reduce reconstruction ambiguity, many works have introduced geometry priors. These priors provide key information about the scene\\u2019s 3D structure, which can be explicitly provided by external sensors like LiDAR or depth cameras [21, 41, 36, 23, 40, 17, 8]. Other methods utilize strong structural priors often found in real-world scenes, such as the assumption that the ground is a flat plane [52, 10, 5], the sky can be modeled as a dome [4, 43], or that walls and tables in indoor scenes are predominantly orthogonal [48]. These structural assumptions help regularize the reconstruction process. While these geometry priors can mitigate some reconstruction challenges, they often fall short of completely solving the artifact problem in extrapolated views, especially when the initial geometric prior is itself inaccurate.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: Method. FreeFix improves the rendering quality of extrapolated views in 3DGS without fine-tuning DMs, as illustrated in the bottom left of the pipeline. We propose an interleaved strategy that combines 2D and 3D refinement to utilize image diffusion models for generating multi-frame consistent results, as shown at the top of the pipeline. In the 2D refinement stage, we also introduce confidence guidance and overall guidance to enhance the quality and consistency of the denoising results.\\n\\n\\nNVS with Generative Priors: \\nGenerative priors leverage pre-trained generative models to assist NVS tasks, particularly when dealing with data scarcity or missing information. Early works explored using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to improve rendering quality [39, 24, 26], where the GAN\\u2019s discriminator ensured the local realism of synthesized images. More recently, DMs [33, 22, 13, 31, 42, 11, 12, 34] have gained prominence for their powerful generative capabilities. Their application in NVS falls into two main categories. The first involves fine-tuning a pre-trained DM, which has learned powerful priors from datasets [37, 41, 35, 38, 54, 49, 47]. This process adapts the model\\u2019s knowledge to scene-specific appearances but can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. The second category, which aligns with our proposed method, leverages a pre-trained DM as a zero-shot prior without fine-tuning. The key challenge here is determining what part of the rendered image should be used as guidance for the DM, and how to maintain multi-view consistency. Using the opacity channel of the rendered image as guidance is a common but often crude solution [45, 16, 46], as areas with high opacity can still be artifacts. Additionally, ensuring consistency across different novel views using IDMs is a critical problem. While VDMs [33, 31, 42, 11] can inherently handle this, they are often computationally heavy and not suitable for all applications.\\n\\n\", \"3 Method\": \"\\n\\n3 Method\\n\\nThe FreeFix pipeline is illustrated in Fig.\\u00a02.

VDMs are widely used for improving 3DGS [9] because of the inherent capability to apply attention across frames, ensuring multi-frame consistency. However, the temporal attention mechanism also introduces a computational burden,\\nwhich also limits the output length of VDMs, as the computation complexity is quadratic in relation to the sequence length. Furthermore, recent advanced VDMs [42, 11, 31] utilize 3D VAE as their encoder and decoder, which performs temporal down-sampling, making it challenging to apply per-pixel confidence guidance.\\n\\n\\nDue to the above reasons, we select IDMs as the backbone in FreeFix. However, most existing IDMs are not designed for the novel view synthesis task and do not take reference views as input. IP-Adapter [44] accepts image prompts as input, but it is intended for style prompts rather than novel view synthesis. Directly applying IDMs can lead to inconsistency across frames and finally result in blurriness in refined 3DGS. To tackle the problem, we propose an interleaved refining strategy, multi-level confidence guidance, and overall guidance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3 Interleaved Refinement Strategy\\n\\n2D Refinement: \\nAs mentioned in Sec.\\u00a03.1, the trajectory of extrapolated views \\ud835\\udcafext={\\ud835\\udcb10e,\\ud835\\udcb11e,\\u2026,\\ud835\\udcb1me}\\\\mathcal{T}_{\\\\textit{ext}}=\\\\{\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{0},\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{1},...,\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{m}\\\\} in our task definition is intended to be continuous. This continuous trajectory setting ensures that adjacent views \\ud835\\udcb1ie\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i} and \\ud835\\udcb1i+1e\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i+1} undergo only small transformations. A naive approach to keep consistency would be warping pixels from \\ud835\\udcb1ie\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i} to \\ud835\\udcb1i+1e\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i+1} and using DMs for inpainting. However, both rendered depth and predicted depth are not reliable for warping. Instead, we propose an interleaved refining strategy to enhance multi-view consistency.\\n\\n\\nSpecifically, the refining process is interleaved and incremental along the trajectory \\ud835\\udcaf\\\\mathcal{T}. Given the current view \\ud835\\udcb1ie\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i}, the current 3DGS \\ud835\\udca2i\\u22121\\\\mathcal{G}_{i-1} and rendered image \\u2110^ie=\\u03c0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb1ie;\\ud835\\udca2i\\u22121)\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e}_{i}=\\\\pi(\\\\mathcal{V}^{e}_{i};\\\\mathcal{G}_{i-1}), we utilize denoising with guidance, as discussed in Sec.\\u00a03.4, to obtain the fixed image \\u2110^ie,f\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{i}. We also maintain a fixed image set \\u2131i\\u22121={(\\ud835\\udcb10e,\\u2110^0e,f),(\\ud835\\udcb11e,\\u2110^1e,f),\\u2026,(\\ud835\\udcb1i\\u22121e,\\u2110^i\\u22121e,f)}\\\\mathcal{F}_{i-1}=\\\\{(\\\\mathcal{V}_{0}^{e},\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{0}),(\\\\mathcal{V}_{1}^{e},\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{1}),...,(\\\\mathcal{V}_{i-1}^{e},\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{i-1})\\\\}. We refine the current 3DGS \\ud835\\udca2i\\u22121\\\\mathcal{G}_{i-1} to \\ud835\\udca2i\\\\mathcal{G}_{i} by using the training set \\ud835\\udcaet\\u200br\\u200ba\\u200bi\\u200bn\\\\mathcal{S}_{train}, the previous refined view set \\u2131i\\u22121\\\\mathcal{F}_{i-1} and the current refined image \\u2110^ie,f\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{i}.\\n\\n\\n3D Refinement: \\nThe supervision during 3D Refinement for \\ud835\\udca2i\\\\mathcal{G}_{i} comes from current refined view (\\ud835\\udcb1ie,\\u2110^ie,f)(\\\\mathcal{V}_{i}^{e},\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}_{i}), \\u2131i\\u22121\\\\mathcal{F}_{i-1} and St\\u200br\\u200ba\\u200bi\\u200bnS_{train}. The detailed sampling strategy for training is illustrated in the supplements.\\n\\n\\nThe generated results do not guarantee 3D consistency with training views, so we employ a smaller training loss for the generated views to prevent inaccurately generated areas from distorting 3D scenes. Additionally, the generated results exhibit slightly color bias compared to training views, which are often difficult for humans to distinguish. However, when applying the interleaved refining strategy, these slight color biases will accumulate, which may lead to a blurry and over-gray effect. We implement a simple yet efficient technique similar to [53] to tackle the problem. For each generated view, we define two optimizable affine matrices \\ud835\\udc9cf\\u2208\\u211d3\\u00d73\\\\mathcal{A}_{f}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{3\\\\times 3} and \\ud835\\udc9cb\\u2208\\u211d3\\u00d71\\\\mathcal{A}_{b}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{3\\\\times 1}. The rendering results used for computing the training loss are applied to these affine matrices to avoid learning color bias:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2110^e\\u2032=\\ud835\\udc9cf\\u00d7\\u2110e^+\\ud835\\udc9cb\\\\displaystyle\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e^{\\\\prime}}=\\\\mathcal{A}_{f}\\\\times\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}^{e}}+\\\\mathcal{A}_{b}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2112=(1\\u2212\\u03bbs)\\u200b\\u2016\\u2110^e\\u2032\\u2212\\u2110^e,f\\u20161+\\u03bbs\\u200bSSIM\\u200b(\\u2110^\\u2032,\\u2110^e,f)\\\\displaystyle\\\\mathcal{L}=(1-\\\\lambda_{s})||\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e^{\\\\prime}}-\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f}||_{1}+\\\\lambda_{s}\\\\textit{SSIM}(\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{{}^{\\\\prime}},\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{e,f})\\n\\n(4)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRendered RGB w Artifacts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u03b3c=0.001\\\\gamma_{c}=0.001\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u03b3c=0.01\\\\gamma_{c}=0.01\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u03b3c=0.1\\\\gamma_{c}=0.1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 4: Multi-Level Certainty Masks. FreeFix employs multiple \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} to obtain multi-level certainty masks as guidance. Each level of mask guides a different stage of denoising. A small \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} with high overall certainty is used for the early stages of denoising, while a large \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} which offers greater accuracy, is applied during the later stages of denoising.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4 Denoising with Guidance\\n\\nGiven the rendered results of an extrapolated view, even though the image contains artifacts, most areas can still be regarded as photo-realistic rendering results. These regions with relatively high fidelity can provide essential information for generating an image free of artifacts, while maintaining almost the same content.\\n\\n\\nExperiments in Difix3D+ [37] have demonstrated that adding noise to images with artifacts and directly applying denoising using DMs can effectively remove these artifacts; however, the strength of the added noise is quite sensitive. For regions with significant artifacts, a larger scale of noise is needed to repaint those areas, while a smaller scale of noise is sufficient for areas with minimal artifacts. Although it may seem intuitive to apply different levels of noise to different regions, this approach does not align the data distribution of DMs. Instead, employing guidance during the diffusion denoising step is more practical and has been widely adopted in [16, 45].\\n\\n\\nConfidence Map: \\nUtilizing appropriate guidance is an effective method for generating high-fidelity images while preserving accurate rendering results. However, current approaches that use warp masks or rendering opacities as guidance weights do not account for the presence of artifacts. For example, as illustrated in Fig.\\u00a03 (a), even when severe artifacts are present, the rendering opacities remain high, indicating that these artifacts continue to act as strong guidance during the denoising process.\\nTo tackle this issue, we propose utilizing confidence masks as guidance weights, as shown in Fig.\\u00a03 (c). The confidence scores are derived from Fisher information, which is also referenced in [7, 6]. Specifically, Fisher information measures the amount of information that the observation (x,y)(x,y) carries about the unknown parameters ww that model pf\\u200b(y|x;w)p_{f}(y|x;w). In the context of novel view synthesis, Fisher information can be defined as:\\n\\n\\n\\npf\\u200b(\\u03c0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)|\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)p_{f}(\\\\pi(\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})|\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})\\n\\n(5)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udcb1\\\\mathcal{V} and \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G} represent viewpoint and 3DGS respectively, while \\u03c0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)\\\\pi(\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}) denotes the volume rendering results at the specific view \\ud835\\udcb1\\\\mathcal{V}.\\n\\n\\nThe negative log likelihood of Fisher information in Eq.\\u00a05, which serves as the uncertainty \\ud835\\udc9e\\u00af\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{\\\\bar{C}}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}} of \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G} at view \\ud835\\udcb1\\\\mathcal{V}, can be approximately derived as a Hessian matrix, the detailed derivation can be found in the supplementary materials:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9e\\u00af\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\\\displaystyle\\\\mathcal{\\\\bar{C}}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}\\n=\\u2212log\\u2061pf\\u200b(\\u03c0|\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)\\\\displaystyle=-\\\\log p_{f}(\\\\pi|\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n=\\ud835\\udc07\\u2032\\u2032\\u200b[\\u03c0|\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2]\\\\displaystyle=\\\\mathbf{H}^{{}^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}}[\\\\pi|\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n=\\u2207\\ud835\\udca2\\u03c0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)T\\u200b\\u2207\\ud835\\udca2\\u03c0\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)\\\\displaystyle=\\\\nabla_{\\\\mathcal{G}}\\\\pi(\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})^{T}\\\\nabla_{\\\\mathcal{G}}\\\\pi(\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})\\n\\n(6)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[7, 6] renders the attribute \\ud835\\udc9e\\u00af\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{\\\\bar{C}}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}} in volume rendering to obtain the uncertainty map. However, uncertainty is not a numerically stable representation, as its value can range from [0,+\\u221e)[0,+\\\\infty). As illustrated in Fig.\\u00a03 (b), the numeric instability of uncertainty may render an inaccurate uncertainty map. This often occurs when there are Gaussians with low opacity and high uncertainty, which can overwhelm the volume rendering. Instead, we use the complementary value as guidance, certainty \\ud835\\udc9e\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}, also referred to as confidence in this paper, which has a stable numeric range of [0,1][0,1].\\nThe certainty \\ud835\\udc9e\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\u03b3c\\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}^{\\\\gamma_{c}} is defined as:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9e\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\u03b3c=exp\\u2061[\\u2212\\u03b3c\\u200b\\ud835\\udc9e\\u00af\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2]\\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}^{\\\\gamma_{c}}=\\\\exp[-\\\\gamma_{c}\\\\mathcal{\\\\bar{C}}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}]\\n\\n(7)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} is a hyperparameter.

The larger the value of \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c}, the more sensitive the rendered confidence map becomes to artifacts. Selecting a single appropriate \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} is not trivial. Therefore, we apply multi-level confidence maps as guidance. Since DMs generate a coarse structure of image rather than detailed appearance in the early denoising stages [27], we provide \\u2133\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\u03b3c\\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}^{\\\\gamma_{c}} with a small \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} to offer more comprehensive guidance. In the later denoising stages, DMs tend to generate detailed appearances, so we provide \\u2133\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\u03b3c\\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}^{\\\\gamma_{c}} with a large \\u03b3c\\\\gamma_{c} to ensure that the guidance is sufficiently accurate.\\n\\n\\nConfidence Guidance: \\nGiven the rendered image I^\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\\\hat{I}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}} and the corresponding confidence map \\u2133\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2\\u03b3c\\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}^{\\\\gamma_{c}}, we can provide denoising guidance to DMs.\\nWe denote the rendered image after VAE encoding as x0rx_{0}^{r}, and the resized confidence map that aligns with the shape of the latent space as \\u2133c\\\\mathcal{M}^{c}. As illustrated in Eq.\\u00a02, the predicted x0tx_{0}^{t} at tt timestep is given by xt\\u2212\\u03c3t\\u200b\\ud835\\udd3d\\u03b8\\u200b(xt,t)x_{t}-\\\\sigma_{t}\\\\mathbb{F}_{\\\\theta}(x_{t},t). We guide the model prediction as x0t,gx_{0}^{t,g} by blending the rendered image using confidence mask:\\n\\n\\n\\nx0t,g=\\u2133c\\u2299x0r+(1\\u2212\\u2133c)\\u2299x0tx_{0}^{t,g}=\\\\mathcal{M}^{c}\\\\odot x_{0}^{r}+(1-\\\\mathcal{M}^{c})\\\\odot x_{0}^{t}\\n\\n(9)\\n\\n\\nHowever, the input for the next denoising step cannot be directly obtained using Eq.\\u00a03 since the model prediction x0tx_{0}^{t} has been changed. Instead, we derive the new xt\\u22121x_{t-1} by solving the following equations:\\n\\n\\n\\nxt\\u22121\\\\displaystyle x_{t-1}\\n=x0+\\u03c3t\\u22121\\u200b\\ud835\\udd3d\\u03b8\\u200b(xt,t)\\\\displaystyle=x_{0}+\\\\sigma_{t-1}\\\\mathbb{F}_{\\\\theta}(x_{t},t)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nxt\\u22121\\\\displaystyle x_{t-1}\\n=xt+(\\u03c3t\\u22121\\u2212\\u03c3t)\\u200b\\ud835\\udd3d\\u03b8\\u200b(xt,t)\\\\displaystyle=x_{t}+(\\\\sigma_{t-1}-\\\\sigma_{t})\\\\mathbb{F}_{\\\\theta}(x_{t},t)\\n\\n(10)\\n\\n\\nThe representation of xt\\u22121x_{t-1} derived from x0t,gx_{0}^{t,g} and xtx_{t} is:\\n\\n\\n\\nxt\\u22121=\\u03c3t\\u22121\\u03c3t\\u200bxt\\u2212\\u03c3t\\u22121\\u2212\\u03c3t\\u03c3t\\u200bx0t,gx_{t-1}=\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{t-1}}{\\\\sigma_{t}}x_{t}-\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{t-1}-\\\\sigma_{t}}{\\\\sigma_{t}}x_{0}^{t,g}\\n\\n(11)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOverall Guidance: \\nAlthough the interleaved refining strategy provides higher fidelity rendering results and ensures that the rendering is more consistent with the generated content, using IDMs may still encounter issues of inconsistency in areas with low confidence. Particularly in regions with weak textures like ground and sky, the confidence map tends to be low, and allowing denoising to proceed freely in these areas can result in high inconsistency and blurriness in 3DGS. To address this issue, we propose an overall guidance approach, which combines confidence guidance in the very early stages of denoising to provide structural hints for the images.\\nThe combination of certainty and overall guidance is defined as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\nx0t,g=\\\\displaystyle x_{0}^{t,g}=\\n\\u2133c\\u2299x0r+\\\\displaystyle\\\\mathcal{M}^{c}\\\\odot x_{0}^{r}+\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(1\\u2212\\u2133c)\\u2299(\\u03b2\\u200b\\u2133\\u03b1\\u200bx0r+(1\\u2212\\u03b2\\u200b\\u2133\\u03b1)\\u200bx0t)\\\\displaystyle(1-\\\\mathcal{M}^{c})\\\\odot(\\\\beta\\\\mathcal{M}^{\\\\alpha}x_{0}^{r}+(1-\\\\beta\\\\mathcal{M}^{\\\\alpha})x_{0}^{t})\\n\\n(12)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u03b2\\\\beta is a hyperparameter that controls the strength of the overall guidance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLLFF [19]\\n\\n\\nMip-NeRF 360 [1]\\n\\n\\nWaymo \\u2009 [29]\\n\\nDM Type\\nw/o Finetune\\nOnly RGBs\\n3D Render\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPSNR\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nSSIM\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nLPIPS\\u2193\\\\downarrow\\n\\n\\nPSNR\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nSSIM\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nLPIPS\\u2193\\\\downarrow\\n\\n\\nKID\\u2193\\\\downarrow\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3DGS [9]\\n\\n18.10\\n0.633\\n0.265\\n21.83\\n0.643\\n0.239\\n0.155\\nN/A\\nN/A\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\nFreeFix + SDXL\\n19.93\\n0.695\\n0.237\\n22.68\\n0.685\\n0.213\\n0.150\\nImage\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\nFreeFix + Flux\\n20.12\\n0.700\\n0.221\\n23.02\\n0.689\\n0.208\\n0.147\\nImage\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\n\\nViewExtrapolator [16]\\n\\n18.27\\n0.614\\n0.338\\n20.84\\n0.591\\n0.332\\n0.180\\nVideo\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\n\\nNVS-Solver [45]\\n\\n11.99\\n0.351\\n0.560\\n12.45\\n0.266\\n0.631\\n0.289\\nVideo\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2718\\n\\n\\n\\nDifix3D+ [37]\\n\\n18.86\\n0.658\\n0.239\\n22.43\\n0.661\\n0.210\\n0.143\\nImage\\n\\u2718\\n\\u2714\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\n\\nStreetCrafter [41]\\n\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\n0.157\\nVideo\\n\\u2718\\n\\u2718\\n\\u2714\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 1: Quantitative Comparison with Baselines.

We select LLFF [19] as the evaluation dataset for forward-facing scenes, Mip-NeRF 360 [1] for object-centric scenes, and Waymo [29] for driving scenes.\\nFor the LLFF and MipNeRF datasets, which contain relatively dense captured images, we select sparse or partially observed views as the training set and choose an extrapolated view trajectory that is distant from the views in the training set. The Waymo dataset only provides captured images from a single pass down the street, making it relatively sparse. We only utilize the front cameras as the training set and then translate or rotate the training cameras to create the test views. Details on the design of the training and testing views are provided in the supplementary materials.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWaymo / 143481\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWaymo / 177619\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3DGS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nViewExtrapolator [45]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStreetCrafter [41]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDifix3D+ [37]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFreeFix\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 7: Qualitative Comparisons on Waymo [29]. FreeFix provide superior performance compared to ViewExtrapolator and StreetCrafter, and is comparable to Difix3D+ in the Waymo dataset. In some cases, FreeFix refines the scene even better than Difix3D+.\\n\\n\\n\\nModel Settings and Baselines: \\nFreeFix utilizes two powerful IDMs as its backbone: SDXL [22] and Flux [13], to showcase the capabilities of our method.\\nFor baseline selection, we consider various methods with different settings. For fine-tuning-free methods, we select ViewExtrapolator [16], and NVS-Solver [45] as the baseline. While ViewExtrapolator refines 3DGS with generated views like ours, NVS-Solver employs VDMs as the final renderer, without using 3D renderers, which consumes more computational resources during rendering.\\nFor methods that require fine-tuning of DMs, we choose Difix3D+ [37] and StreetCrafter [41] as baselines. StreetCrafter focuses on urban scenes and requires both LiDAR and RGB observations as input, while Difix3D+ is more generalizable and only requires RGB images. For all methods with a 3D renderer, we apply nearly the same 3D refining steps, ensuring that there are sufficient refining steps for the models to converge.\\n\\n\\nEvaluation Metrics: \\nFor the experiments on LLFF and MipNeRF, we adopt the most common settings for quantitative assessments, which include the evaluation of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS [51]. In the case of the Waymo dataset, where no ground truth is available for the test images, we utilize KID [2] for quantitative assessments.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.1 Comparison with Baselines\\n\\nWe evaluate FreeFix using SDXL [22] and Flux [13] as the diffusion backbone on the LLFF, Mip-NeRF 360, and Waymo datasets. This includes a quantitative comparison in Tab.\\u00a01 and qualitative comparisons in Fig.\\u00a05 and Fig.\\u00a07 against baseline methods. Although FreeFix utilizes only IDMs as the backbone and does not require fine-tuning of the DMs, it still demonstrates performance that is comparable to, or even surpasses, methods that use VDMs or require fine-tuning, both in quantitative and qualitative assessments.\\n\\n\\nSpecifically, ViewExtrapolator [16], which uses opacity masks as guidance, shows slight improvements in LLFF, although the improvement is less significant compared to our confidence-guided solution.\\nMoreover, it fails to provide improvements in Mip-NeRF 360 and Waymo.\\nThis is due to the fact that ViewExtrapolator uses the nearest view from a set of training views as the reference view to generate the test views in a video diffusion model.\\nWhile using the nearest training view as the reference view in SVD performs well in the forward-facing scenes in LLFF, where the test views are closer to the training views, this is usually not the case for Mip-NeRF 360 and Waymo, hence ViewExtrapolator yields degraded performance.\\n\\n\\nDifix3D+ demonstrates the most generalizability and powerful performance across our baselines. FreeFix surpasses Difix3D+ [37] in LLFF and Mip-NeRF 360, while providing comparable performance in Waymo.\\nWe attribute this to the generalizability of DMs. Although Difix3D+ is finetuned on DLV3D [15] and may have encountered similar scenes to those in LLFF and Mip-NeRF 360, the domain gap between datasets still weakens the generalizability of Difix3D+. In contrast, our method maintains the original generalizability of DMs learned from web-scale datasets. Regarding the Waymo dataset, Difix3D+ is fine-tuned on a large-scale in-house driving dataset, where driving scenes are highly structured and exhibit relatively small inter-class differences, making them easier for models to learn.\\n\\n\\nStreetCrafter [41] is tailored for urban scenes and requires LiDAR as input; for this reason, we only conduct experiments with this model on the Waymo dataset. In contrast to the original setting in StreetCrafter, our setup only provides the front camera to color the LiDAR points, which highlights the limitations of StreetCrafter in this context.\\nNVS-Solver produces less satisfying results compared to other methods, which may be attributed to inaccurate depth estimation and warping results. We provide NVS-Solver results in supplementary materials.\\n\\n\\nPlease note that we compute the average score across scenes for each dataset. We provide a quantitative comparison for each scene, along with additional qualitative comparisons in the supplementary materials.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.2 Ablation Study\\n\\nImage Diffusion Models vs Video Diffusion Models: \\nFreeFix can also be applied to VDMs without temporal down-sampling, such as SVD [3]. Although SVD offers inherent consistency across frames, it suffers from blurriness compared to more advanced IDMs. We conduct an ablation study on the scene from MipNeRF-360/Garden to provide quantitative and qualitative comparisons in Tab.\\u00a02 and Fig.\\u00a06. Additionally, we include the results from ViewExtrapolator [16] on the same scene. While ViewExtrapolator also uses SVD as its backbone, it employs an opacity mask as guidance, which disentangles the effects of the differences in diffusion model backbones and helps demonstrate the effectiveness of our confidence guidance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPSNR\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nSSIM\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nLPIPS\\u2193\\\\downarrow\\n\\nGuidance\\n\\n\\n3DGS\\n18.38\\n0.415\\n0.357\\nN/A\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVE [16] + SVD\\n\\n17.86\\n0.409\\n0.505\\nOpacity\\n\\n\\nFreeFix + SVD\\n19.03\\n0.453\\n0.331\\nCertainty\\n\\n\\nFreeFix + SDXL\\n19.41\\n0.517\\n0.294\\nCertainty\\n\\n\\nFreeFix + Flux\\n19.72\\n0.520\\n0.287\\nCertainty\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 2: Quantitative Ablation on Diffusion Models Selection. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPSNR\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nSSIM\\u2191\\\\uparrow\\n\\n\\nLPIPS\\u2193\\\\downarrow\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRaw Flux [13]\\n\\n19.23\\n0.390\\n0.389\\n\\n\\n+ Confidence Guidance\\n19.32\\n0.435\\n0.349\\n\\n\\n+ Interleave Strategy\\n19.65\\n0.517\\n0.293\\n\\n\\n+ Overall Guidance\\n19.72\\n0.520\\n0.287\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 3: Ablation Study on Modules of FreeFix.

We conduct an ablation study of these modules on the scene from MipNeRF-360/Garden, as shown in Tab.\\u00a03. We perform experiments starting from a raw Flux model, which we slightly modify to function as an image-to-image model. We progressively add components from FreeFix to demonstrate the necessity of these techniques.\\n\\n\\n\", \"5 Conclusion\": \"\\n\\n5 Conclusion\\n\\nIn this paper, we present FreeFix, a method for fixing artifacts and improving the quality of 3DGS without fine-tuning DMs. FreeFix demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across various datasets and possesses strong capabilities for deployment with future, more advanced DMs.\\nHowever, FreeFix still has certain limitations. It may encounter failure cases when extrapolated views lead to excessive artifacts with minimal credible guidance. Additionally, the updating process for 3DGS is relatively slow and challenging to converge over dozens of refining steps. These challenges suggest opportunities for future work on designing more robust and efficient methods for integrating 3D reconstruction with 2D generative models.\\n\\n\\nAcknowledgements:\\nThis work is supported by NSFC under grant 62202418, U21B2004, and 62441223, the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2021ZD0114501, and Scientific Research Fund of Zhejiang University grant XY2025028.\\n\\n\\n\", \"6 3DGS Fisher Information Derivation\": \"\\n\\n6 3DGS Fisher Information Derivation\\n\\nThe uncertainty attribute of 3DGS in this paper is defined as:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9e\\u00af\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2=\\u2212log\\u2061pf\\u200b(\\u03c0|\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)\\\\mathcal{\\\\bar{C}}_{\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}}=-\\\\log p_{f}(\\\\pi|\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G})\\n\\n(13)\\n\\n\\nUnder the following regularity conditions, \\u2212log\\u2061pf\\u200b(\\u03c0|\\ud835\\udcb1;\\ud835\\udca2)-\\\\log p_{f}(\\\\pi|\\\\mathcal{V};\\\\mathcal{G}) can be viewed as a loss term for Fisher information.

The process for generating testing views in the Waymo dataset is straightforward; we translate the camera by 2 to 3 meters or rotate it by 10 to 15 degrees horizontally. However, the design for LLFF and Mip-NeRF 360 is not as straightforward, as we aim to construct extrapolated views that have ground truth images. For this reason, we cannot generate trajectories freely; instead, we need to create partitions for the testing and training sets. We present visualizations of the training and testing cameras in Fig.\\u00a08 from these scenes to illustrate the design of the extrapolated views. For some scenes where obvious extrapolated trajectories cannot be directly extracted, we aim to make the training views sparse in order to produce relative extrapolated trajectories.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLLFF\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfern\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhorns\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nleaves\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfortress\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntrex\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMip-NeRF 360\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngarden\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstump\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbicycle\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncounter\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nkitchen\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 8: Design of Training and Testing Views Design.

We demonstrate the application of our approach based on the case study of robot cutting of unknown materials. Compared to baseline methods, including our previous work, CycleGAN, and conditional variational autoencoder-based time series translation, our approach achieves improved task completion time and behavioural stability with minimal real-world data.

These processes are characterised by a high degree of uncertainty coupled with demands of logistical flexibility, which traditionally implies the requirement for expensive reprogramming and reconfiguration of robots. This is of interest in domains such as nuclear decommissioning, robotic disassembly of complex products for recycling and re-use, and even areas such as robotic surgery or demolition with robotised demolition equipment. Nonetheless, challenges exist in automated planning and task execution for destructive operations. Whereas manufacturing paradigms centre around achieving high dimensional tolerances and precise control on a known workpiece, for disassembly, the precise location of cutting is less important (few mm as opposed to \\u03bc\\\\mum) while the precise sequence of cutting operations may not be known in advance. This uncertainty has motivated various approaches to robotic cutting, consisting of goal-conditioned trial-and-error & revision [25, 26], 3D reconstruction & planning [9], and online learning & adaptation [18, 22].\\n\\n\\nReinforcement learning (RL) has been applied with success to a variety of contact-rich tasks [2, 23], including robotic cutting [31, 15], particularly with difficult-to-model environments with complex robot-environment interactions, but are nonetheless data intensive. Whereas simulation environments offer reduced complexity and overhead of data collection, differences between simulated and physical cutting processes limit the applicability of adaptive methods to real-world tasks. Examples of such differences include motor backlash, tool wear, chattering, cross-domain mismatch of process and model parameters and other disturbances. These differences motivate the use of domain adaptation methods to align representations or behaviours across domains with minimal real-world supervision. These can be broadly separated into unified feature representation learning, model-based correction, and model-free synthesis of target domain examples.\\n\\n\\nDomain adaptive methods include [29] in which policies are trained on a cross-domain latent feature representation by aligning source and target domain distributions. A related concept applied to milling was proposed in [31] based on a cross-domain meta-model, trained on pairwise unified feature representations. Similarly, adversarial losses using domain discriminators have been employed for cross-domain tool wear classification [20]. Reconstruction-based methods have also been employed to jointly model observation and class distributions[12]; this concept has been further developed based on conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs) [33] wherein CVAE feature representations were used to train an RL policy, while feature representations are aligned across domains.\\n\\n\\nModel-based approaches have previously also been employed for domain adaptation, wherein a source domain task model is augmented with a corrective model based on physics-informed approaches [24], neural networks [13, 5] or Gaussian process (GP) models [19, 27] learned from target domain data. In our previous work, [16] we proposed an imitation learning framework in which a GP corrective model was learned from multiple cutting demonstrations. Nonetheless, model-based approaches incur limitations of modelling assumptions under which the models are introduced, and incur a dataset overhead, particularly for deep predictive modelling approaches.\\n\\n\\nRelating to the aforementioned approaches is direct alignment of observations across domains via translation or generative models. In the context of milling, [4] proposed a domain adaptation method for condition monitoring of different milling tools based on a generative CNN. Similarly, [30], proposed a domain adaptive imitation learning framework from visual demonstrations based on CycleGAN [32]. Generation at object level has also been proposed [17] wherein a StyleGAN image translation model is trained object-wise on weakly-paired cross-domain datasets for 6D pose estimation. CVAEs have also been employed for domain adaptation via synthesis of novel target domain examples [28].\\n\\n\\nNeural style transfer has been extensively researched in the context of image processing [11, 10]. Recently, this concept has been extended to motion execution. Thus far, its application has been limited largely to expressive stylised motions mirroring that of human operators [8, 7]. Nonetheless, its applicability to synthesise novel trajectories with characteristics of diverse human operators presents a compelling case for its application to other domain adaptation problems. Recently, this has been applied for dataset augmentation tasks [6]. A limitation of the aforementioned methods is lack of a suitable pairing mechanism for style and content, as well as lack of feature extractor backbones prevalent in image processing tasks. For transfer learning, addressed this problem [3] by building on the concept of conditional adversarial domain adaptation [21] to achieve feature-level style transfer for transfer learning. Nonetheless, adversarial alignment can be difficult to train, with well-known problems of mode collapse and vanishing gradients. Whereas these developments have been applied to time series classification problems, application of style transfer for RL policy transfer is, to the best of our knowledge, largely unexplored.\\n\\n\\nThis paper extends our previous example-based approach for sim-to-real adaptation to arbitrary real world examples. As with our previous work, our approach does not require re-training of classifiers or encoder networks to adapt to new scenarios (different disturbance forces, differing sensor dynamics, etc.). In contrast to prior work that applies neural style transfer primarily for stylised motion synthesis or dataset augmentation, we apply it as a trajectory-level domain adaptation mechanism for robotic skill transfer. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a latent-space pairing mechanism for content and style that operates without paired examples or retraining; (2) a novel transfer framework based on neural style transfer that does not require labelled or reward-supervised data from the target domain; and (3) empirical evaluation on robotic cutting, a task where conventional reinforcement learning pipelines are difficult to apply due to the absence of reward signal in the real-world deployment environment. An overview of our framework is provided in Figure 1.\\n\\n\\nFigure 1: Overview of proposed framework. In the first stage, a simulation of cutting mechanics is used to generate an expert policy and a variational autoencoder (VAE) is trained on simulated trajectory windows. In the second stage, the VAE encoded representations are used to generate pairings between a simulated and real world dataset which are used as style targets. Finally, expert trajectories are used to train a learner target domain policy with the generated observation windows.\\n\\n\", \"Style transfer framework\": \"\\nStyle transfer framework\\n\\nVariational autoencoder\\n\\nThe variational autoencoder (VAE) consists of two neural networks: an encoder q\\u03d5\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc9b|\\ud835\\udc99)q_{\\\\phi}(\\\\boldsymbol{z}|\\\\boldsymbol{x}) that approximates the posterior over latent variables \\ud835\\udc9b\\u2208\\u211dL\\\\boldsymbol{z}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{L}, and a decoder p\\u03b8\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc99|\\ud835\\udc9b)p_{\\\\theta}(\\\\boldsymbol{x}|\\\\boldsymbol{z}) that reconstructs the data from the latent representation.

Training was carried out with the Adam optimiser, with model hyperparameters established via manual search, reported in Table Style transfer. Both encoder and decoder networks were implemented as strided convolutional networks with 3 layers. Batch normalisation was further employed to accelerate convergence and reduce training instability. The encoder architecture is visualised in Figure 2.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: Overview of VAE encoder architecture; layer indices for style transfer are demarcated.\\n\\n\\nThe VAE training dataset consisted of a mixture of 680 on-policy and off-policy simulated trajectories. We consider a trajectory as a multivariate time series of length TT which comprises a sequence of state-action pairs:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u03c4={(\\ud835\\udc99t,\\ud835\\udc9at)}t=1T\\\\tau=\\\\{(\\\\boldsymbol{x}_{t},\\\\boldsymbol{y}_{t})\\\\}_{t=1}^{T}\\n\\n(4)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udc99t\\u2208\\u211dNS\\\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{N_{S}}, \\ud835\\udc9at\\u2208\\u211dNA\\\\boldsymbol{y}_{t}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{N_{A}} are the states, actions at time tt respectively. Each trajectory \\u03c4\\\\tau is divided into overlapping windows of length NN, resulting in a set of state and action windows:\\n\\n\\n\\nx(i)=\\\\displaystyle x^{(i)}=\\n[xt,xt+1,\\u2026,xt+N]\\u2208\\u211dN\\u00d7NS\\\\displaystyle[x_{t},x_{t+1},\\\\dots,x_{t+N}]\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\times N_{S}}\\n\\n(5)\\n\\n\\n\\ny(i)=\\\\displaystyle y^{(i)}=\\n[yt,yt+1,\\u2026,yt+N]\\u2208\\u211dN\\u00d7NA\\\\displaystyle[y_{t},y_{t+1},\\\\dots,y_{t+N}]\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\times N_{A}}\\n\\n(6)\\n\\n\\nThe window width NN and latent code dimensionality emerge as tunable parameters for which a trade-off exists between the temporal context afforded to the model, reproduction accuracy and saliency of the latent space. Through preliminary experiments, this was reflected in increased RMS error of the autoencoder reconstructions and reduced average cosine similarity between simulated and real world embeddings with increasing NN and dimensionality respectively. A window size of N=100N=100 samples (2 seconds) was identified as providing the best trade-off between these factors.\\n\\n\\n\\nPolicy adaptation\\n\\nWe adopt a similar approach to our previous work [16] to adapt a pre-trained policy to observations synthesised from unlabelled target domain data. In this procedure, an \\u201cexpert\\u201d policy \\u03c0e\\\\pi_{e} is initially trained in a simulation environment with a physically-informed cutting model, as introduced in our previous work [14], with model parameters from Table Style transfer. The expert was trained initially for 32000 episodes using the proximal policy optimisation (PPO) algorithm with domain randomisation of material properties. A translation function f:\\u211dN\\u00d7NS\\u2192\\u211dN\\u00d7NAf:\\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\times N_{S}}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\times N_{A}} is applied to each state window:\\n\\n\\n\\nx(g,i)\\u2063\\u2217=f\\u200b(x(c,i))x^{(g,i)*}=f(x^{(c,i)})\\n\\n(7)\\n\\n\\nand translated states paired with the corresponding expert action on x(c)x^{(c)} to generate a labelled dataset\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9f={(x(g,i),\\u03c0e\\u200b(x(c,i)))}.\\\\mathcal{D}=\\\\{(x^{(g,i)},\\\\pi_{e}(x^{(c,i)}))\\\\}.\\n\\n(8)\\n\\n\\nWe subsequently train a target domain policy \\u03c0g\\\\pi_{g}, initialised as \\u03c0g=\\u03c0e\\\\pi_{g}=\\\\pi_{e} on \\ud835\\udc9f\\\\mathcal{D} using behavioural cloning. We note this procedure can be extended to alternative imitation learning algorithms (such as DAgger) provided ff can be inferred during generation of source windows x(c,i)x^{(c,i)}. Under the assumption that the environment satisfies the Markov property, the policy learning process is unaffected by the windowing procedure. As the full trajectories do not need to be reconstructed, limitations of other methods such as requirement for blending or enforcing temporal consistency are inapplicable to this work [7]. Furthermore, as each trajectory is decomposed into T\\u2212N+1T-N+1 windows, the windowing approach has the effect of significantly augmenting the training data.\\n\\n\\n\\nStyle transfer\\n\\nIn this work, we consider neural style transfer[11] as a translation function wherein x(g)\\u2063\\u2217x^{(g)*} arise from solving the style transfer optimisation problem:\\n\\n\\n\\nx(g,i)\\u2063\\u2217=arg\\u2061minx(g,i)\\u2061(wc\\u200bLc\\u200b(x,x(c,i))+ws\\u200bLs\\u200b(x,x(s,j)))x^{(g,i)*}=\\\\arg\\\\min_{x^{(g,i)}}\\\\left(w_{c}L_{c}(x,x^{(c,i)})+w_{s}L_{s}(x,x^{(s,j)})\\\\right)\\n\\n(9)\\n\\n\\nwhere wcw_{c} and wsw_{s} are the content and style weights, respectively and LcL_{c}, LsL_{s} are content and style loss contributions respectively. The content loss is defined as:\\n\\n\\n\\nLc=\\u2211l\\u2211i,j12\\u200bNl\\u200b(Fi\\u200bj(c,l)\\u2212Fi\\u200bj(g,l))2L_{c}=\\\\sum_{l}\\\\sum_{i,j}\\\\frac{1}{2N_{l}}\\\\left(F^{(c,l)}_{ij}-F^{(g,l)}_{ij}\\\\right)^{2}\\n\\n(10)\\n\\n\\nwhere F(c,l)F^{(c,l)}, F(g,l)F^{(g,l)} are the feature outputs of layer ll for the content and generated output respectively. The style loss similarly is expressed as\\n\\n\\n\\nLs=\\u2211l\\u2211i,j14\\u200bNl2\\u200bMl2\\u200b(Gi\\u200bj(s,l)\\u2212Gi\\u200bj(g,l))2L_{s}=\\\\sum_{l}\\\\sum_{i,j}\\\\frac{1}{4N^{2}_{l}M^{2}_{l}}\\\\left(G^{(s,l)}_{ij}-G^{(g,l)}_{ij}\\\\right)^{2}\\n\\n(11)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udc06(s,l)\\\\mathbf{G}^{(s,l)} is the style Gram matrix of layer ll outputs F(s,l)F^{(s,l)}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc06(s,l)=F(s,l)\\u200bF\\ud835\\uddb3\\u200b(s,l)\\\\mathbf{G}^{(s,l)}=F^{(s,l)}F^{\\\\mathsf{T}(s,l)}\\n\\n(12)\\n\\n\\nand similarly for \\ud835\\udc06(c,l)\\\\mathbf{G}^{(c,l)}. The generated windows were initialised as\\n\\n\\n\\nx(g,i)=x(c,i)x^{(g,i)}=x^{(c,i)}\\n\\n(13)\\n\\n\\nand (9) optimised by gradient descent using the Adam optimiser. The relative content-style weighting wc/w\\u200bsw_{c}/w{s} was tuned manually through a grid-search procedure. Figure 3 shows the effect of content-style weighting on their relative loss contributions. At low values of wc/w\\u200bsw_{c}/w{s}, the total loss is dominated by increasing content reconstruction error; the generated windows diverge substantially from the original windows with marginal effect on style reconstruction. Hence, wc/w\\u200bsw_{c}/w{s} was reduced until diminishing returns on the (unweighted) style reconstruction loss was observed. We report relevant optimisation parameters in Table Style transfer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 3: Effect of content-style weight ratio wc/wlw_{c}/w_{l} on normalised (unweighted) content-style loss, averaged over 5 content-style batches (batch size 256), with chosen value wc/ws=0.02w_{c}/w_{s}=0.02 indicated (dotted line). Decreasing ratio results in diminishing returns on style while diverging substantially from the original content windows. Increasing ratio tends towards identity (generated windows correspond to unaltered simulated windows).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 1: Selected hyperparameters for encoder network and style transfer framework.\\n\\n\\n\\nParameter\\nValue\\n\\n\\nEncoder learning rate\\n1\\u00d710\\u221231\\\\times 10^{-3}\\n\\n\\nEncoder output channels\\n[128,256,512]\\\\left[128,256,512\\\\right]\\n\\n\\nEncoder kernel size\\n3\\n\\n\\nEncoder batch size\\n128\\n\\n\\nEncoder kernel stride\\n2\\n\\n\\nWindow size\\n100\\n\\n\\nLatent dimensions\\n130\\n\\n\\nContent-style ratio wc/wsw_{c}/w_{s}\\n\\n0.02\\n\\n\\nStyle transfer learning rate\\n0.01\\n\\n\\nStyle transfer iterations\\n1000\\n\\n\\nContent layer indices (Fig. 2)\\n[x]\\n\\n\\nStyle layer indices (Fig. 2)\\n[2, 5, 7]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 4: Convergence plot for style transfer optimisation with parameters from Table Style transfer for a batch of 256 content-style pairings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 2: Table of model parameters for cutting simulation (source domain)\\n\\n\\n\\nParameter\\nValue\\n\\n\\nPitch angle [rad]\\n0.126\\n\\n\\nHelix angle [rad]\\n0.0\\n\\n\\nRadius [m]\\n0.025\\n\\n\\nCutter width [m]\\n0.0005\\n\\n\\nCutting elements (flutes)\\n50\\n\\n\\nSpindle speed [rpm]\\n1000\\n\\n\\nMaterial cutting\\n\\n\\n\\n-mechanistic constant (KcK_{c}) [N/mm2]\\nvariable\\n\\n\\nMaterial edge\\n\\n\\n\\n-mechanistic constant (KeK_{e}) [N/mm]\\nvariable\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 5: t-SNE embedding diagram of content-style pairings. The points are coloured according to their class (simulation, blue / real world, red) with intensity according to the cosine similarity of their closest match, diverging from 0.5. The area of each real world embedding point is directly proportional to the number of times the corresponding window was matched.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA compelling advantage of encoder or classifier-based approaches is that they operate on unpaired cross-domain datasets. To improve the realism of generated trajectories, we employ a pairing mechanism that takes advantage of the unsupervised feature representations learned from the source domain data to generate weakly paired content and style windows. An intuitive analogue would be matching images with similar composition and subjects, reminiscent of the weak paring mechanism in [17]. In the first stage, the real world dataset is encoded in entirety by the encoder network to generate a dataset of embeddings. In the second stage, the simulated content window(s) are encoded and a content-style pairing matrix is constructed by the pairwise cosine similarity between x(c,i)x^{(c,i)}, x(s,j)x^{(s,j)} representations as\\n\\n\\n\\nSi\\u200bj=zi\\u22c5zj\\u2016zi\\u2016\\u22c5\\u2016zj\\u2016S_{ij}=\\\\frac{z_{i}\\\\cdot z_{j}}{||z_{i}||\\\\cdot||z_{j}||}\\n\\n(14)\\n\\n\\nIn the last stage, the closest match real embedding is paired with the simulated embedding. For each row ii, the index of the most similar pairing was obtained by:\\n\\n\\n\\nj\\u2217\\u200bi=arg\\u2061max\\u2061j,Si\\u200bjj^{*}i=\\\\arg\\\\max{j},S_{ij}\\n\\n(15)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor windows where the pairing diverged substantially from the content, the optimisation process introduced mean shifts into the observations, as well as introducing artefacts from the encoding process. Following the intuition of [10], qualitatively, we observed that pre-aligning the means of the content and style windows resulted in higher quality generated outputs. Figure 5 shows a representation of the content-style pairings generated by the pairing procedure. The data show the formation of distinct clusters according to simulated and real world trajectories. Unsurprisingly, the real world embeddings with the most matches were found predominantly at the intersections of the clusters. This parasitic behaviour is reminiscent of the mode-collapse phenomenon in generative-adversarial networks. Nonetheless, around 50% of real world points were matched at least once, with matched windows dispersed throughout the latents, indicating good coverage of the real world dataset.\\n\\n\\nFor adaptation, 50 episodic trajectories were collected in source domain with the expert policy, which formed the content dataset. For this work, the style dataset consisted of 148 off-policy trajectories collected from the real world. We note this is not a hard requirement; dataset size is motivated primarily by avoiding breakdown of the pairing and style transfer mechanism where content and style windows diverge substantially.\\n\\n\\n\\nExperimental setup\\n\\nAs with our previous work, experimental validation was carried out on a KUKA LBR iiwa R820 14kg collaborative robot equipped with a wrist-mounted motorised slitting saw tool. The iiwa was connected via the Fast Research Interface (FRI) to a Robot Operating System (ROS) workstation with a communication frequency of 500Hz. The workstation consisted of an Intel i7-8086K CPU, NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti GPU with 11GB VRAM, and 32GB RAM. The robot was equipped with a motorised slitting saw tool; whereas geometric parameters of the tool reflect the training parameters in Table Style transfer, the number of teeth was doubled to introduce further cross-domain mismatch.\\n\\n\\nThe cutting task was represented as a single conventional milling pass over an material with variable geometry, following a nominal trajectory defined at the material surface. As proof of principle, the reference path was defined manually with respect to the surface for all case studies. During the cutting task, the policy provides as output a translational stiffness, incremental offset to the depth of cut (DoC), and the feed rate, relative to the planned (nominal) trajectory. The nominal feed rate was chosen as 0.75 m/min. The controller damping gain \\ud835\\udc0ad\\\\mathbf{K}_{d} was adjusted independently according to the stiffness to provide a damping ratio of 1.0 (i.e. critically damped). Trajectory tracking was achieved according to the operational space control law\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udeaa=\\ud835\\udc09\\ud835\\uddb3\\u200b[\\u039b^\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc92)\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc0ad\\u200b(t)\\u200b\\ud835\\udc86\\u02d9+\\ud835\\udc0ap\\u200b(t)\\u200b\\ud835\\udc86)+\\ud835\\udf41^\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc92,\\ud835\\udc92\\u02d9)+\\ud835\\udf46^\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc92)]\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Gamma}=\\\\mathbf{J}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}\\\\left[\\\\hat{\\\\Lambda}(\\\\boldsymbol{q})\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{K}_{d}(t)\\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{e}}+\\\\mathbf{K}_{p}(t)\\\\boldsymbol{e}\\\\right)+\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}}(\\\\boldsymbol{q},\\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{q}})+\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\rho}}(\\\\boldsymbol{q})\\\\right]\\n\\n(16)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udeaa\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Gamma} are the commanded joint torques, \\ud835\\udc09\\\\mathbf{J} the robot Jacobian, and \\u039b^\\\\hat{\\\\Lambda}, \\ud835\\udf41^\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}}, \\ud835\\udf46^\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\rho}} are the estimated operational space inertia matrix, Coriolis & centrifugal forces, and gravitational forces respectively.\\n\\n\\nDuring the cutting task, the process force was monitored via an FT-AXIA 80 force-torque sensor, mounted at the robot wrist. However, our method in principle is applicable to different types of sensors, such as those built in to the iiwa, provided real world examples collected with such sensors. Prior to each trial, the force sensor was biased at the start of the trajectory.

To demonstrate the performance of each method on a range of materials, cutting trials were carried out on polyurethane foam, cardboard, corrugated plastic, mica and aluminium. We further establish 3 separate case studies on each material to evaluate the policy performance under different path planning conditions. We evaluate each method by task completion time, average path deviation, average tool load, material removed volume (MRV), and similarity of the adopted action trajectories to the source domain expert actions, averaged over 5 trials per material for each strategy, and aggregated over all materials. To mitigate effects of drift (e.g. tool wear, temperature, calibration errors), trials for each strategy were interleaved.\\n\\n\\nComparison methods\\n\\nFor the subsequent real world experiments, we adopt the following terminology to denote comparison methods: \\u2018Expert\\u2019 refers to the unadapted source simulation expert policy, as transferred directly to the real world task. \\u2018BC\\u2019, or standalone behavioural cloning, represents our previous work, in which the simulation is augmented with a Gaussian process (GP) regression model trained on aligned demonstrations from 14 preliminary experiments on aluminium and mica. \\u2018CVAE\\u2019 represents a conditional variational autoencoder using the same real world dataset as adopted for style transfer. Note in this instance, the encoder itself is trained on the entire dataset of both real world and simulation data, conditioned on a one-hot domain label (simulation or real world). Simulated data are encoded as with the style transfer approach, however, at decoding time, the one-hot class label is swapped to generate a synthetic window of the desired class. \\u2018CycleGAN\\u2019 is also introduced as a comparison method. In this instance, the surrogate real world dataset is synthesised by the sim-to-real generator network. With all methods, the generator / encoder architecture was chosen equivalent to Table Style transfer. For CycleGAN, a smaller discriminator network, with output channels [64,128,256][64,128,256] was used due to mitigate the well-known \\u2018vanishing gradient\\u2019 problem during GAN training. All other hyperparameters were chosen to be equivalent to the CycleGAN study. All methods were employed with behavioural cloning as per the self-supervision procedure introduced in this work. Additionally, as a benchmark, we include a \\u201cbaseline\\u201d strategy in which the process parameters are held constant at the nominal feed rate (0.75m/min) and depth of cut of 1 mm, applied to all materials.\\n\\n\\n\\nPlanar material case study\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) Flat\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) DoC offset\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(c) Curved\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 7: Boxplot summary of performance metrics for the style transfer trained policy and comparison methods, aggregated over all materials. Metrics include task completion time, average path deviation, average load force, average (normalised) dynamic time warping (DTW) distance between each strategy and the simulation expert policy (lower better), and material removed volume (MRV, higher better).\\n\\n\\nEach strategy was initially tested on a planar material, with the reference path calibrated at the material surface. For the calibration procedure, the surface was modelled as a warped plane interpolated between 4 corner points obtained via guarded move with a force threshold of 1N, with the exception of foam, where contact was confirmed visually. The performance of each strategy for the planar case study is outlined in Figure 7(a). To aid interpretation, the significance of the difference in metrics was tested via one-way ANOVA. The normality and homoscedasticity assumptions of ANOVA were tested via the Shapiro-Wilk and Levene methods respectively. A significance level of \\u03b1=0.05\\\\alpha=0.05 was used for all tests. Metrics that did not satisfy the assumptions were transformed via Box-Cox transform:\\n\\n\\n\\ny={x\\u03bb\\u22121if\\u200b\\u03bb\\u22600log\\u2061(x)otherwisey=\\\\begin{cases}x^{\\\\lambda}-1&\\\\mathrm{if}\\\\,\\\\lambda\\\\neq 0\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\log(x)&\\\\mathrm{otherwise}\\\\end{cases}\\n\\n(18)\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u03bb\\\\lambda is chosen to maximise the log-likelihood of the transformed data under a normality assumption. In the case of completion time and average force, the assumptions of ANOVA were satisfied (Shapiro p=0.361p=0.361, p=0.355p=0.355; Levene p=0.0689p=0.0689, p=0.0983p=0.0983, respectively). Average path deviation and MRV did not satisfy the normality assumption after transformation, and in this case the Kruskal-Wallis test was adopted without transformation. For both task completion time and average force, one-way ANOVA revealed significant effects of strategy on performance (F=61.1F=61.1, p=1.14\\u00d710\\u221227p=1.14\\\\times 10^{-27}; F=6.74F=6.74, p=6.52\\u00d710\\u22125p=6.52\\\\times 10^{-5} respectively) between strategy and these performance metrics.\\n\\n\\nTo examine the effect of individual strategy on the performance metrics, the Tukey Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) was used for ANOVA, and the Dunn post-hoc test for Kruskal-Wallis. No significant difference in task completion times was found between style transfer and BC, whereas the former outperformed all other methods. Style transfer had the largest effect relative to GAN (\\u22121.00-1.00 s) and the smallest relative to the Expert (\\u22120.329-0.329 s). For path deviation, style transfer significantly differed from the Expert (\\u22121.50-1.50 mm, p=0.000196p=0.000196) and GAN (0.4510.451 mm, p=0.005074p=0.005074) strategies, however, results were inconclusive for BC (p=0.560p=0.560) and CVAE (p=0.109p=0.109). Style transfer was further found to significantly outperform the Expert and BC strategies in minimising average force (\\u22121.273-1.273 N, p=0.0001p=0.0001; \\u22120.651-0.651 N, p=0.0352p=0.0352), however, no significant difference was found between style transfer and the CVAE and GAN strategies (p=0.867p=0.867, p=0.611p=0.611). The choice of strategy was found to have no conclusive effect on MRV (Kruskal H=2.87H=2.87, p=0.578p=0.578). This result appears surprising in light of the differing action selection apparent for each strategy, particularly in DoC.\\n\\n\\nTo examine the effect of the adaptation methods on the agent actions, the actions taken during each trial were compared with 50 simulated experiments (i.e. source domain) carried out with the source domain expert, and the similarity of action trajectories evaluated by normalised dynamic time warping (DTW) distance. The strategies that adopt actions that are more broadly similar to the source domain expert will score lower on this metric than those that deviate substantially from the expert behaviour. The expert policy itself was included in this comparison since it is being applied to the target domain. We report effect sizes as Hedges\\u2019 gg. Clear differences between the strategies were indicated (Kruskal H=1930H=1930, p=0.0p=0.0), with style transfer yielding large improvements relative to the Expert g=0.875g=0.875 and GAN g=2.18g=2.18, a moderate improvement for CVAE g=0.575g=0.575 and a small reduction in performance relative to BC g=\\u22120.370g=-0.370. Post-hoc testing indicated a high significance level in these effects (p\\u22643.65\\u00d710\\u221217p\\\\leq 3.65\\\\times 10^{-17}) for all comparisons.\\n\\n\\nTo examine the behaviour of each strategy in more detail and enable qualitative comparisons between each strategy, the action trajectories adopted by each policy during an example trial on foam and mica are presented in Figure 8. From Figure 8(a), 8(d), 8(g), 8(j), the action trajectories were broadly similar between BC and style transfer across both materials. Style transfer adopts a more correct behaviour of reducing the feed rate prior to engagement with the material, as compared with BC. Conversely, the GAN policy diverges substantially from the expert behaviour which corroborates the DTW metric results. All adapted policies adopted a more consistent DoC throughout both trials than the unadapted expert policy. Differences between the policy behaviour on each material were mainly evident in the DoC behaviour, transverse stiffness (KxK_{x}) and, to a lesser extent, the normal stiffness (KzK_{z}).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFlat\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2005DoC offset\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2002\\u200aCurved\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) Foam - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) Foam - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(c) Foam - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(d) Foam - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(e) Foam - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(f) Foam - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(g) Mica - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(h) Mica - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(i) Mica - BC, style transfer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(j) Mica - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(k) Mica - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(l) Mica - CVAE, GAN\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 8: Comparison of agent actions for foam and mica for planar, DoC offset and curved case studies respectively. Actions include the relative to nominal feed rate adjustment, with 0 corresponding to no change and 1 to double the nominal feed rate, depth of cut (DoC), and controller stiffness in transverse, feed direction and normal directions respectively (Kp,xK_{p,x}, Kp,yK_{p,y}, Kp,zK_{p,z}. Units of KpK_{p} are chosen consistent with (16)).\\n\\n\\n\\nRobustness to path planning offset\\n\\nTo examine the robustness of the method to path planning errors - for example, due to errors in calibration, surface position estimation or noise, we further examine the performance of all strategies with a path planning offset of 1mm, inset into the ground truth material surface. The performance of each strategy was evaluated over 3 trials per strategy, per material.\\n\\n\\nSimilarly to the planar case, strategy significantly impacted task completion times (ANOVA F=17.0F=17.0, p=9.94\\u00d710\\u221210p=9.94\\\\times 10^{-10}); style transfer again differed significantly from all strategies except BC (Tukey HSD p=0.0694p=0.0694), and improvements over other strategies being similar to the planar case study, albeit more consistent across strategies (effect size range \\u22120.658-0.658-\\u22120.850-0.850 s). Whereas path deviation was also influenced by strategy (ANOVA F=4.61F=4.61, p=0.00235p=0.00235), post-hoc testing indicated only GAN differed significantly from the BC (p=0.0047p=0.0047) and Expert (p=0.0125p=0.0125) strategies. Although group means were more concentrated than in the planar case, path deviation was notably more consistent across trials for style transfer, CVAE, and GAN, implying these strategies were better able to tolerate the path planning offset and maintain stable path tracking across materials. MRV was again unaffected by strategy (Kruskal-Wallis H=2.61H=2.61, p=0.624p=0.624), and contrasting the planar case study, no significant differences were observed in average tool load (ANOVA F=1.06F=1.06, p=0.382p=0.382). Similarly to the planar case study, there was a clear separation between the strategies in terms of similarity to expert actions (Kruskal H=688H=688, p=9.33\\u00d710\\u2212148p=9.33\\\\times 10^{-148}). Post-hoc testing indicated style transfer was distinct from the comparison methods, with the least significant result being with CVAE (p=0.0314p=0.0314), small negative effects for BC g=\\u22120.321g=-0.321 and CVAE g=\\u22120.151g=-0.151 and positive effects relative to Expert g=0.682g=0.682 and GAN g=1.31g=1.31 strategies.\\n\\n\\nFigure 8(b), 8(e), 8(h), 8(k) shows the agent actions for the offset case study. All strategies exhibited a more sporadic DoC behaviour than the planar case study, with style transfer exhibiting the most consistent DoC behaviour across both materials, and matching more closely to the planar case study behaviour, supporting observations regarding the consistency of the path deviation. All strategies exhibited a more aggressive variation in stiffness relative to the planar case study, indicating a compensatory response to the offset cutting depth.\\n\\n\\n\\nNon-planar surfaces\\n\\nWe further showcase the performance of each strategy when both material and surface geometry are altered to varying degrees of curvature. Consistent with the planar case study, the reference path with respect to the surface was assumed already known; however, we note that numerous path-planning methods have been proposed in the context of milling, including the case where surface geometry is unknown [9]. For this case study, we assume the material is a thin plate under pure bending, with the surface modelled as a section of a truncated oblique cone \\u2013 in other words, an interpolation between two circular arcs. The arc parameters for each endpoint were derived from a 3-point estimation obtained similarly to the planar case study. Curvatures ranged between 2.36 m-1 and 4.04 m-1 across materials. Cardboard was excluded from the set of materials since the maximum curvature generated during preliminary experiments did not meaningfully differ from the previous case studies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(a) Polyurethane foam\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(b) Corrugated plastic\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(c) Mica\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(d) Aluminium\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 9: 3D plot of TCP paths adopted by each strategy with respect to the material surface - qualitative defects are shown in the \\u201cexpert\\u201d and \\u201cGAN\\u201d strategies, which exhibit transverse path deviations on the stiffer materials.\\n\\n\\nAs with the prior case studies, strategy had a significant effect on completion time (Kruskal H=38.5H=38.5, p=8.44\\u00d710\\u22128p=8.44\\\\times 10^{-8}) and in post-hoc testing, style transfer outperformed all strategies except BC (p=0.529p=0.529). The effect of style transfer largely reflected the planar case study, with \\u22121.00-1.00 s relative to GAN, and \\u22120.413-0.413 s relative to the Expert. Differences in path deviation were inconclusive compared to the planar case study, (Kruskal H=9.77H=9.77, p=0.0445p=0.0445) with the most significant result from post-hoc testing arising between GAN and style transfer (p=0.0589p=0.0589); however, differences in average force were more pronounced (ANOVA F=7.71F=7.71, p=0.000025p=0.000025), with style transfer significantly outperforming GAN (\\u22121.25-1.25 N, p=0.0001p=0.0001) but not the other strategies. Corroborating the previous case studies, MRV did not significantly differ between strategies (Kruskal H=2.15H=2.15, p=0.708p=0.708). Furthermore, action similarity again revealed clear separation between strategies (Kruskal H=1390H=1390, p=2.64\\u00d710\\u2212300p=2.64\\\\times 10^{-300}), with style transfer exhibiting the largest deviation from GAN (g=2.14g=2.14) and significant differences from all others (BC g=\\u22120.264g=-0.264, CVAE g=0.503g=0.503, Expert g=0.487g=0.487).\\n\\n\\nThe agent actions, as shown in Figure 8(c), 8(f), 8(i), 8(l), show similar behaviours to the offset case study, with differences in DoC behaviour becoming more pronounced, particularly for the expert policy. CycleGAN adopted a highly sporadic action profile in feed rate and stiffness, particularly for the foam trials. A hypothesis for this behaviour is that the curved material presents a more challenging case for the agent and the much lower cutting forces limit information available to the agent to make decisions. Therefore, the actions resemble those at the beginning of the planar trials in which the agent is in free space and has no information about the contact state or tool engagement. Style transfer and BC both exhibited less consistent DoC behaviour than the planar case studies on foam, however, produced smoother action trajectories that were strongly correlated to the engagement state - for example, contact initiation was well-demarcated for both strategies.\\n\\n\\nFigure 9 shows a representative example of the 3D TCP positions adopted by each strategy for a single cutting trial. The TCP trajectories adopted exhibited clear defects for the expert and GAN trials, which were evident across both low and high stiffness materials. On the low stiffness materials, such as in Figure 9(a) these were evident as low-frequency irregularities, resembling a random walk, whereas for the high stiffness materials, this was exhibited as a higher frequency \\u201cwobble\\u201d, which were unrelated to known phenomena such as chattering. These defects were suppressed or entirely absent during the BC, CVAE and style transfer trials, with these methods yielding similar qualitative improvements across all materials.\\n\\n\\n\", \"Discussion\": \"\\nDiscussion\\n\\nFor the cutting task, the proposed method was evaluated based on task completion times, average path deviation, tool load (average force), material removed volume, behavioural similarity to expert action trajectories in source domain, and qualitatively by the action trajectories, ability to maintain consistent cutting conditions (e.g. depth of cut), as well as TCP trajectories. Relative to the comparison methods \\u2013 consisting of the unadapted source domain expert policy (Expert), our previous work (BC), conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) and CycleGAN (generative adversarial network) \\u2013 the proposed method based on style transfer consistently achieved significant reductions in task completion time across all case studies. Compared to BC and CVAE, style transfer showed comparative performance but did not uniformly surpass them across all metrics.\\n\\n\\nThe reduced influence of strategy in the offset path case study is consistent with the constraint imposed by insetting the path into the material, which limits the ability of the agent to regulate the true DoC. It also implies a common limitation of these methods in modelling out-of-distribution task conditions, wherein offsetting the reference path and nominal feed rate introduces concept shift in the optimal actions across domains in addition to covariate shift in the observations. Although path deviation was more consistent across style transfer, CVAE and GAN strategies than for BC and the expert policy, overall improvements were primarily inconclusive. It is plausible that the inconclusive effects may be attributable to the reduced number of samples for the offset case study.\\n\\n\\nQualitatively, the style transfer trained policy demonstrated improved behavioural stability relative to the model-free approaches, with smoother action trajectories and more consistent control of depth-of-cut and stiffness, which was robust to perturbations in surface geometry and cutting path, and corroborated by higher action similarity to the source domain expert relative to all strategies except BC. The irregular path deviations observed in the TCP trajectories were attributable to the largely sporadic action trajectories of the expert policy, and, to a lesser extent, the GAN strategy. For the stiffer materials, deviations in the path are caused by contact instabilities resulting from interaction between the policy stiffness and the environment stiffness. These behaviours were largely absent with the BC, CVAE and style transfer strategies.\\n\\n\\nWe hypothesise that the poorer performance of CycleGAN-based domain adaptation arises from its limited capacity to preserve task-relevant structure in the translated observations, which has been documented in related work [1]. While CycleGAN has been effective in visual domains where semantic content remains invariant under style changes\\u2014e.g. image-to-image translation, its application to time-series control tasks may disrupt temporal dependencies or distort dynamics-critical features, leading to degraded policy performance.\\n\\n\", \"Conclusion\": \"\\nConclusion\\n\\nAn example-based approach for sim-to-real transfer in robotic control was proposed based on the principle of neural style transfer. Empirical results on a robotic cutting task demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable or superior performance to our previous work, conditional variational autoencoders, and CycleGAN-based time series translation across diverse materials and geometric scenarios, while substantially relaxing the assumptions of our previous example-based work. The proposed method is sample-efficient, demonstrated with 148 off-policy real world trajectories versus 32000 for initial policy training, and avoids the need for training domain discriminator, generator or corrective models, a crucial limitation of previously proposed adaptation methods.\\n\\n\\nWe note the limitation that this work does not explicitly address differing cross-domain target (action) distributions or compatibility of generated trajectories with robot kinematic and dynamic constraints. We posit such constraints could be formulated as part of the optimisation process wherein physical feasibility losses are jointly optimised with style and content losses, and represents a possible extension of this work. Additionally, the quality of generated trajectories and pairings is expected to deteriorate with low coverage of real-world examples, weak content-style match similarity, or parasitic matching where a small subset of real trajectories dominate the pairing.\\n\\n\", \"Data availability\": \"\\nData availability\\n\\nThe datasets generated during and/or analysed during the current study are available in the Figshare repository, DOI 10.6084/m9.figshare.28983659.\\n\\n\", \"Funding Declaration\": \"\\nFunding Declaration\\n\\nThis work was supported by the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) project \\u201cResearch and Development of a Highly Automated and Safe Streamlined Process for Increase Lithium-ion Battery Repurposing and Recycling\\u201d (REBELION) under Grant 101104241.\\n\\n\", \"Acknowledgements\": \"\\nAcknowledgements\\n\\nThe authors would further like to acknowledge Abdelaziz Wasfy Shaarawy, Carl Meggs and Christopher Gell respectively for assistance with experimental validation, design of material holder and cutter tool for experiments herein.\\n\\n\", \"Author contributions\": \"\\nAuthor contributions\\n\\nConceptualisation - A.R. and J.H.; data curation - J.H.; formal analysis - J.H.; funding acquisition - A.R. and R.S.; investigation - J.H.; methodology - J.H. and A.R.; project administration - A.R. and R.S.; software - J.H.; resources - J.H., A.R. and R.S.; supervision - A.R. and R.S.; validation - J.H. and A.R.; visualisation - J.H.; writing (original draft) - J.H.; writing (review & editing) - J.H. and A.R. and R.S.\\n\\n\", \"Competing interests\": \"\\nCompeting interests\\n\\nThe authors declare no competing interests.\\n\\n\"}, \"bibliography\": {\"[1]\": \"\\n[1]\\nH.

naturally reason about object functionality, identify the relevant functional element (e.g., a heater knob or thermostat), and interact with it using an appropriate body configuration.\\nHowever, performing such functionally-correct interactions in a novel 3D environment remains challenging for embodied intelligent agents, as it requires a holistic understanding of scene semantics and the human actions that the environment affords\\u00a0[7, 4].\\nIn this work, we investigate to generate realistic and functional interactions between a 3D human body and a novel scene, conditioned on open-vocabulary task descriptions.\\nAn effective solution to this problem benefits a wide range of applications, including embodied AI, robotics, game production, and video generation, among many others.\\n\\n\\nThe synthesis of 3D human-scene interaction (HSI) has been extensively studied, with existing methods broadly falling into two paradigms.\\nData-driven approaches learn generative models from paired 3D interaction data, achieving high visual fidelity and realistic human poses in controlled settings.\\nFor example, COINS\\u00a0[47] models human body poses conditioned on scene geometry and text commands, while TriDi\\u00a0[29] learns a joint distribution over human pose, object geometry, and interaction signals using diffusion models.\\nDespite their effectiveness, such methods rely on large-scale, high-quality paired interaction datasets and typically require explicit interaction specifications (e.g., \\u201csitting on a sofa\\u201d), limiting their ability to generalize to diverse novel scenes.\\nTo alleviate data dependency, recent work has explored zero-shot or training-free pipelines that leverage pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to generate human-scene interactions.\\nRepresentative examples include GenZI\\u00a0[18], which reconstructs 3D human bodies from multi-view image synthesis, and GenHSI\\u00a0[20], which integrates image-based object grounding with 3D body fitting from a single input image.\\nWhile these methods improve flexibility and support open-vocabulary task prompts, they are primarily effective for general human-scene interactions describing physical relations or motions, e.g., \\u201csitting on a sofa\\u201d or \\u201cwalking on a bridge\\u201d.\\n\\n\\nIn contrast, many real-world tasks like \\u201copen the window\\u201d involve interactions at a functional level, where a human must identify and interact with fine-grained functional elements in the 3D scene to complete the task, such as finding and contacting a window handle to open a window, as shown in Fig.\\u00a01.\\nWe refer to this setting as functional human-scene interaction.\\nThis problem poses fundamental challenges, as it requires reasoning about both the semantics of functional elements in 3D scenes and the 3D human poses needed to establish appropriate contacts.\\nExisting methods typically lack explicit reasoning about object functionality and the corresponding human-scene contact, leading to interactions that are either geometrically implausible or functionally incorrect.\\n\\n\\nIn this work, we propose FunHSI, a training-free, functionality-driven\\nframework that enables functional human-scene interactions from\\nopen-vocabulary task prompts.\\nGiven a set of posed RGB-D images and a task prompt, FunHSI reasons about the functionality of the 3D scene and synthesizes a 3D human that interacts with the scene in a functionally correct manner to accomplish the specified task.\\nAs illustrated in Fig.\\u00a02, FunHSI is built upon three key components.\\nFirst, we introduce a functionality-aware contact reasoning module to identify task-relevant functional elements in the scene, reconstruct their 3D geometry, and infer high-level interaction patterns via contact graph reasoning.\\nThe resulting contact graph explicitly encodes the contact relationships between the human body and both functional and supporting scene elements, serving as a structured representation that bridges high-level task intent and low-level physical interaction.\\nSecond, we propose a functionality-aware body initialization module that synthesizes a human performing the task in the image and estimates the corresponding initial 3D body and hand poses.\\nTo mitigate hallucinations during human synthesis, we introduce a human inpainting optimization strategy that automatically evaluates and improves the generated human pose configuration.\\nIn addition, since image-based synthesis may produce left-right hand inconsistencies with the inferred contact graph, we further refine the contact graph to align contact specifications with the synthesized human.\\nFinally, a body refinement module places the initialized 3D human into the scene and performs stage-wise optimization to jointly refine body pose and human-scene contacts, ensuring both physical plausibility and functional correctness.\\n\\n\\nWe conduct experiments on the SceneFun3D dataset\\u00a0[4] under both functional and general human-scene interaction settings.\\nExtensive qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our design and the superior performance of our framework compared to existing baselines.\\nIn addition, we show that FunHSI is compatible with recent feed-forward 3D reconstruction methods, such as MapAnything\\u00a0[15], and can generate realistic human-scene interactions in reconstructed city scenes.\\nIn summary, our contributions are as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nWe propose FunHSI, a training-free framework that generates functionally correct human-scene interactions from open-vocabulary task prompts. FunHSI extends beyond general interactions to support functional interaction scenarios across diverse scenes and actions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nWe introduce a robust optimization strategy for inpainting humans and contact graph refinement scheme, providing valuable insights for functional human-scene interactions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that FunHSI achieves strong performance in both functional and general HSI tasks compared to existing baselines.

Mat. Fig.\\u00a011) and are fixed across all experiments.\\nWe then prompt a large language model (LLM), e.g., GPT-4o\\u00a0[25] or Gemini, with the task description, the detected functional elements, the predefined body-part set, and additional structured instructions that encourage task-complete and human-like interactions.\\nThe LLM outputs a contact graph \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G}, which specifies the involved body parts, the functional and supporting scene elements, and their corresponding contact relations (see Fig.\\u00a02).\\nSimilar to functional elements, inferred supporting elements (e.g., the floor) are segmented in each image and lifted to 3D masks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3 Functionality-aware Body Initialization\\n\\nAlthough the inferred contact graph \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G} provides high-level interaction constraints, directly fitting a 3D human body to the scene remains challenging due to the strong sensitivity of optimization-based methods to initialization.\\nTo obtain a reliable initial body configuration, we first synthesize a human performing the task in the image and then estimate the corresponding 3D body and hand poses.\\nSince image-based synthesis may introduce left-right inconsistencies with the inferred contact graph, we update the contact graph to align its laterality with the initialized human body.\\n\\n\\nHuman inpainting with contact-aware reasoning.\\n\\nWe employ a vision-language model (VLM), specifically Gemini\\u00a0[2], to synthesize human pixels in the input image.\\nTo encourage the generated human to perform the specified task and establish appropriate contacts with the scene, we introduce a contact-aware prompting strategy.\\nIn addition to the input image without humans and the task description, the inpainting prompt incorporates the inferred contact graph and the detected object bounding boxes.\\nThese cues explicitly specify task-relevant functional and supporting elements, guiding the model to generate human body parts in spatial proximity to the target objects.\\nHowever, image inpainting models may hallucinate, unintentionally altering scene structures or introducing spurious objects, as illustrated in Fig.\\u00a03.\\nTo mitigate this issue, we adopt an iterative generator-critic scheme inspired by LLM-based optimization\\u00a0[40].\\nA separate Gemini model is used as a critic to compare the inpainted image with the original input and verify that (1) the generated human performs the specified task, (2) contacts with functional elements are plausible, and (3) no irrelevant or non-existent objects are introduced.\\nIf any criterion is violated, the generator is prompted to regenerate the human appearance.\\nThis process is repeated until all criteria are satisfied or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\\nIn practice, we find that 3-4 iterations are sufficient and outperform single-pass image generation.\\n\\n\\nFigure 3: Visualization of the human inpainting optimization process. By automatically evaluating the human inpainting results, the image generation process is optimized to produce more reliable outcomes, thus strongly facilitating the subsequent body optimization step.\\n\\n\\n\\n3D human estimation.\\n\\nGiven the human-inpainted image, we estimate SMPL-X parameters to initialize the 3D human body.\\nSpecifically, we estimate the global translation \\ud835\\udc2b\\\\mathbf{r}, root orientation \\ud835\\udf4b\\\\bm{\\\\varphi}, and body pose \\ud835\\udf3db\\\\bm{\\\\theta}^{b} using CameraHMR\\u00a0[26], and estimate hand pose parameters \\ud835\\udf3dh\\\\bm{\\\\theta}^{h} using WiLoR\\u00a0[30].\\nFor cases where the hands are occluded in the image, \\ud835\\udf3dh\\\\bm{\\\\theta}^{h} is initialized to the default relaxed hand pose of SMPL-X.\\nThe estimated SMPL-X body is then transformed from the camera coordinate system to the world coordinate system using the known camera pose, ensuring that the human body and the scene are represented in a common reference frame.\\nThe resulting SMPL-X parameters provide a task-specific and geometrically plausible initialization, which substantially simplifies the subsequent body refinement stage.\\n\\n\\n\\nContact graph refinement.\\n\\nWe observe that image generation models may fail to consistently capture left-right spatial relations.\\nFor example, as shown in Fig\\u00a09, the synthesized image may depict the left hand contacting a handle, even when the inferred contact graph specifies contact with the right hand.\\nSuch laterality inconsistencies between the initialized body configuration and the contact graph can lead to invalid human-scene interactions during subsequent refinement.\\nTo address this issue, we refine the contact graph by aligning its laterality with the inpainted image.\\nSpecifically, we project the left and right wrist joints of the estimated 3D body onto the 2D image plane and compute their distances to the center

and\\n\\ud835\\udc30left,\\ud835\\udc30right\\\\mathbf{w}_{\\\\text{left}},\\\\mathbf{w}_{\\\\text{right}} are the 3D wrist joints.\\nIf dleft>dright+\\u03b4d_{\\\\text{left}}>d_{\\\\text{right}}+\\\\delta, where \\u03b4\\\\delta is a small tolerance to account for projection noise and pose estimation errors, we apply a symmetric left-right swap to all hand-related nodes in the contact graph \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G} (e.g., palm and finger nodes).\\nOtherwise, the contact graph remains unchanged.\\nThis simple distance-based criterion is effective at resolving left-right ambiguities across different scenes and camera viewpoints.\\nThe refined contact graph is denoted as \\ud835\\udca2\\u2217\\\\mathcal{G}^{*}.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4 Optimization-based Body Refinement\\n\\nTo refine the body pose, global configurations, and the contact, a conventional solution is to jointly optimize all SMPL-X parameters.\\nHowever, we find in our trials that such joint optimization often leads to unrealistic HSI results, such as unnatural facing orientation and penetration to the scene.\\nTherefore, we propose a two-stage coarse-to-fine optimization method to gradually refine the initial body state.\\nThis will not only preserve nuances in the initial body pose, but also improve the body-scene contact, making the 3D human body performing the specified task.\\n\\n\\nOptimization objective.\\n\\nTo penalize body-scene interpenetration, we define a collision loss based on the signed distance field (SDF) of the SMPL-X body.\\nGiven a scene point cloud \\ud835\\udcab={\\ud835\\udc29j}j=1N\\\\mathcal{P}=\\\\{\\\\mathbf{p}_{j}\\\\}_{j=1}^{N}, the collision loss is formulated as\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2112col=\\u2211j=1Nmax\\u2061(0,\\u2212\\u03a8\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc29j;\\u03b2,r,\\u03c6,\\u03b8)),\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{col}}=\\\\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\\\max\\\\bigl(0,\\\\;-\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{p}_{j};\\\\beta,r,\\\\varphi,\\\\theta)\\\\bigr),\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n\\nwhere

current SMPL-X body configuration, computed using VolumetricSMPL\\u00a0[24].\\nThis loss penalizes scene points that lie inside the body volume and evaluates to zero when no interpenetration occurs.\\n\\n\\nTo further enforce task-consistent body-scene contact, we introduce a contact loss guided by the refined contact graph \\ud835\\udca2\\u2217\\\\mathcal{G}^{*}.\\nFor each contact pair

The symbol * denotes that the baselines are their modified versions for fair comparison.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvaluation Metrics.\\n\\nWe evaluate HSI synthesis using 4 complementary metrics, i.e. semantic consistency score (SCS), non-collision score (NCS), non-functional contact distance (N-FCD), and functional contact distance (FCD), respectively.\\nThe semantic consistency score measures the alignment between the synthesized 3D interaction and the input text prompt.\\nWe compute a CLIP score\\u00a0[31] by rendering each synthesized interaction into three views, extracting image-text cosine similarities using CLIP ViT-B/32, and averaging the scores across views.\\nFor non-collision score, we compute a non-collision score based on penetration between the SMPL-X body mesh and the reconstructed scene point cloud, following VolumetricSMPL\\u00a0[24].\\nFor non-functional contact distance, we use the average Chamfer distance between the human body mesh and supporting scene elements (e.g., the floor or chair).\\nThe functional contact distance assesses whether the synthesized interaction has appropriate contact with task-relevant functional elements, e.g., a hand touching a door handle in the task of \\u201copen the door\\u201d.\\nThis metric is computed as the Chamfer distance between the functional element region and the interacting human hands.\\n\\n\\n\\nBaselines.\\n\\nTo our knowledge, no existing method explicitly targets functional human-scene interactions in 3D.\\nWe therefore compare our approach with the most closely related baselines.\\nGenZI\\u00a0[18] synthesizes human appearances in individual views and reconstructs a 3D body via multi-view fitting.\\nFor a fair comparison, we adapt GenZI to operate on the same three posed RGB-D images used in our benchmark.\\nGenHSI\\u00a0[20] proposes a training-free pipeline for generating long human-scene interaction videos by combining keyframe planning, 3D-aware inpainting, and motion animation.\\nWe extend GenHSI with functional element detection, perform human inpainting from randomly sampled views, and apply its original body-fitting strategy to our inputs.\\nDue to these adaptations, the resulting baselines are denoted as GenZI* and GenHSI*, respectively.\\n\\n\\nFigure 4: Qualitative results on SceneFun3D for general human-scene interaction.\\nWe compare GenZI*, GenHSI*, and our FunHSI with non-functional prompts such as sitting, squatting, and walking.\\n\\n\\nFigure 5: Qualitative results on SceneFun3D for functional human-scene interaction.\\nGiven open-vocabulary functional commands (e.g., adjusting temperature, dialing a number, switching a radio station) and posed RGB-D inputs, we compare GenZI*, GenHSI*, and our FunHSI.\\nExisting methods struggle to reason about task intent and often interact with incorrect objects or miss fine-grained functional components.\\nIn contrast, FunHSI accurately identifies task-relevant functional elements and generates physically plausible 3D human poses that establish correct contacts with both large objects and small functional parts (e.g., knobs, dials, cabinet handles), demonstrating robust functional grounding and contact reasoning.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.1 Comparison to Baselines\\n\\nQuantitative Evaluation.\\n\\nTable\\u00a01 summarizes the quantitative comparison between our FunHSI method and the modified baselines.\\nOverall, FunHSI performs competitively in the general HSI setting and substantially outperforms the baselines in functional HSI.\\nFor general HSI, FunHSI achieves comparable semantic consistency (0.2498) while improving physical plausibility.\\nIn particular, it attains the lowest contact distance (0.7481), outperforming GenZI* (0.8496) and GenHSI* (0.7599), together with a slightly higher non-collision score (0.9929), indicating that improved contact quality is not achieved at the cost of increased body-scene penetration.\\nFor functional HSI, FunHSI consistently yields the best results, with the lowest functional contact distance (0.2968) and the lowest overall contact distance (0.1837), significantly outperforming GenZI* and GenHSI*.\\nAlthough GenHSI* achieves a marginally higher non-collision score (0.9925 vs. 0.9917), FunHSI maintains comparable physical plausibility and semantic consistency (0.2540).\\n\\n\\nFigure 6: Illustration of functionality awareness of FunHSI.\\nGiven the same 3D scene, FunHSI generates distinct human-scene interactions conditioned on different high-level task prompts.\\n\\n\\nFigure 7: Qualitative results on in-the-wild scenes.\\nWe show our FunHSI results on real-world scenes captured by smart phone in Munich.\\n\\n\\n\\nQualitative Evaluation.\\n\\nFig.\\u00a04 and Fig.\\u00a05 show qualitative comparisons under both general and functional human-scene interaction scenarios.\\nFor functional tasks that require identifying and interacting with task-relevant elements (e.g., operating knobs, opening drawers, or interacting with small appliances), the baseline methods often fail to localize the correct functional targets or produce inaccurate hand-object contacts.\\nIn contrast, FunHSI consistently grounds interactions on the appropriate functional elements and generates realistic human-scene interactions.\\nFor general interaction prompts such as sitting, squatting, or standing near scene objects, FunHSI produces perceptually plausible body poses and interactions, achieving performance comparable to the baseline methods.\\nFig.\\u00a06 further illustrates the functional awareness of FunHSI: given different high-level task prompts abouth the same scene or object, the generated bodies accomplish the intended tasks with diverse and appropriate poses.\\nAdditional visual results are provided in the supplementary material.\\n\\n\\n\\nGeneralization to City Scenes.\\n\\nFig.\\u00a07 presents qualitative results on in-the-wild city scenes captured using a smartphone in public spaces in a city.\\nGiven multi-view RGB images reconstructed into 3D scenes, FunHSI successfully generates plausible human-scene interactions for diverse real-world tasks, such as opening an emergency door, buying a parking ticket, and sitting on a bench.\\nDespite the challenges posed by cluttered environments, noisy geometry, and incomplete reconstructions, our method robustly grounds interactions to the correct functional elements and produces physically plausible body poses.\\nThese results demonstrate that FunHSI generalizes beyond curated indoor datasets and is compatible with real-world feedforward 3D reconstruction pipelines.\\nMore visualizations are provided in Fig.\\u00a012 of the supplementary material.\\n\\n\\nFigure 8: User study of 3D human\\u2013scene interaction synthesis on our curated dataset.

Study\\n\\nWe conduct a perceptual user study to evaluate the visual quality and interaction realism of synthesized 3D human\\u2013scene interactions.\\nThe study is performed on the SceneFun3D benchmark under both functional HSI and general HSI settings.\\nParticipants are presented with rendered interaction results generated by FunHSI and the baseline methods, and are asked to select the most plausible and realistic human\\u2013scene interaction for each task.\\nThe evaluation focuses on overall perceptual quality, including the appropriateness of body pose, physical plausibility of contact, and consistency with the given task prompt.\\nFig.\\u00a08 summarizes the user preference results.\\nOverall, FunHSI is strongly preferred over the baseline methods across all evaluation settings.\\nWhen taking GenHSI as a representative baseline, FunHSI achieves an overall preference rate of 71.1%.\\nWhen evaluated separately, FunHSI obtains a preference rate of 76.8% for functional HSI and 66.0% for general HSI, indicating a clear advantage in scenarios that require functional reasoning and affordance-aware interaction.\\nMoreover, the preference margins are more pronounced in functional HSI, indicating that users are particularly sensitive to correct functional grounding and realistic contact with task-relevant elements.\\nThese results demonstrate that FunHSI not only improves quantitative metrics, but also produces perceptually more convincing human\\u2013scene interactions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMethod\\nNCS \\u2191\\\\uparrow\\nN-FCD \\u2193\\\\downarrow\\nFCD

(green).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3 Ablation Studies\\n\\nContact graph refinement.\\n\\nWe ablate the contact graph refinement module by directly using the initial contact graph predicted by the LLM, without aligning left-right relations to the inpainting image.\\nAs shown in Table\\u00a02 and Fig.\\u00a09, removing this refinement leads to degraded contact accuracy, particularly for supporting elements such as the floor, while only marginally affecting the functional distance.\\nThis behavior indicates that ambiguities in left-right correspondence between the contact graph and the generated image can cause failures in the body fitting stage, highlighting the importance of contact graph refinement for stable and accurate interactions.\\n\\n\\n\\nBody & hand pose estimation.\\n\\nWe evaluate the importance of body and hand pose estimation by removing this module from our pipeline and initializing the SMPL-X body with a T-pose prior to refinement.\\nAs shown in Table\\u00a02 and Fig.\\u00a010, this modification leads to consistent degradation across all metrics.\\nThis observation indicates that accurate body and hand pose estimation from the inpainted image plays a critical role in guiding the optimization.\\n\\n\\nFigure 10: Effect of body and hand pose initialization.\\nBody and hand pose initialization provides a consistent starting point, enabling correct hand placement and stable refinement for functional interactions.\\n\\n\\n\\nBody refinement.\\n\\nWe ablate the body refinement stage by directly using the estimated SMPL-X pose without further optimization.\\nAs shown in Table\\u00a02, this results in increased body-scene penetration and less realistic contacts, indicating that the initial pose alone is insufficient to resolve geometric inconsistencies.\\nThese results confirm the necessity of body refinement for producing physically plausible and functionally correct HSI.\\n\\n\\n\\nFunctional element detection.\\n\\nTo evaluate the impact of detection accuracy, we replace the predicted functional element masks with ground-truth annotations (i.e., oracle detection).\\nAs reported in Table\\u00a02, oracle detection leads to a noticeable reduction in functional contact distance (from 0.2968 to 0.2662) while preserving comparable non-collision performance.\\nThis improvement suggests that our generation framework can directly benefit from more robust upstream detection modules.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"5 Conclusion\": \"\\n\\n5 Conclusion\\n\\nIn this work, we studied the problem of functional human-scene interaction synthesis, where a human must reason about object functionality and establish appropriate physical contact to accomplish an open-vocabulary task in a novel 3D scene.\\nWe proposed FunHSI, a training-free and functionality-driven framework that generates 3D human-scene interactions from posed RGB-D observations and open-vocabulary task prompts, without relying on explicit action-object descriptions.\\nBy integrating functionality-aware contact graph reasoning, human initialization, and optimization-based body refinement, FunHSI bridges high-level task intent and physically plausible interaction.\\nExtensive evaluations on a benchmark derived from SceneFun3D show that FunHSI consistently outperforms existing baselines, particularly for functional interactions, while maintaining strong physical plausibility.\\nWe believe FunHSI represents a step toward more semantically grounded human-scene interaction synthesis and opens up future directions for long-horizon and real-world embodied interaction.\\n\\n\\nLimitations and future work.\\n\\nOur method currently focuses on single-step functional human-scene interactions, where a single human pose is synthesized to accomplish a given task.\\nAs a result, it does not explicitly model long-horizon or multi-step interactions that require sequential planning or temporal reasoning across multiple actions (e.g., opening a door and then walking through it).\\nExtending FunHSI to support temporally coherent, multi-step functional interactions remains an interesting direction for future work.\\nIn addition, the scales of city scenes are estimated from RGB images. Unifying the body and the scene scales is also a future work.\\n\\n\\n\", \"Acknowledgement\": \"\\nAcknowledgement\\n\\nWe sincerely thank Alexandros Delitzas and Francis Engelmann for the guidance on SceneFun3D, Priyanka Patel on the guidance of CameraHMR, Muhammed Kocabas for fruitful discussions on foundation models.\\nWe also sincerely thank Nitin Saini and Nathan Bajandas for kind help and explorations on Unreal Engine.

executable contact reasoning, we annotate the SMPL-X body surface using a hierarchical part decomposition.\\nAt the coarse level, we partition the body surface into 15 semantic parts following the SMPL-X template\\u00a0[27]:\\nhead, left upper arm, right upper arm, left forearm, right forearm,\\nleft hand, right hand, back, buttocks,\\nleft thigh, right thigh, left calf, right calf, left foot, and right foot,\\nas illustrated in Fig.\\u00a011.\\nEach part corresponds to a fixed subset of vertices on the SMPL-X mesh, yielding consistent semantic labeling across different poses and body shapes.\\nSince functional interactions in indoor environments are primarily performed by the hands and often involve small-scale objects (e.g., knobs, switches, dials), we further introduce a fine-grained hand annotation.\\nSpecifically, each hand is subdivided into six sub-parts: one palm and five fingers.\\nEach sub-part is associated with a predefined vertex set on the SMPL-X mesh, as shown in Fig.\\u00a011.\\nThis design allows the representation of both whole-hand contacts (e.g., palm-handle) and finger-level functional interactions (e.g., index finger-button) without introducing unnecessary anatomical complexity.\\nThis hierarchical annotation plays a dual role in our pipeline.\\nFirst, it provides a structured and semantically grounded vocabulary for LLM-based contact graph reasoning, enabling the model to express contacts using interpretable body-part names (e.g., \\u201cleft index finger touches the switch\\u201d).\\nSecond, it establishes a direct mapping from contact semantics to geometric constraints: each contact node bb in the contact graph is mapped to its corresponding vertex set \\ud835\\udcb1b\\\\mathcal{V}_{b}, which is used to compute contact losses during body refinement.\\nBy grounding language-level contact reasoning in mesh-level geometry, this annotation enables precise functional interactions while maintaining physical

approach for human-scene interaction (HSI) synthesis under fair and controlled settings, we construct a new benchmark derived from the SceneFun3D dataset.\\nWe select 30 indoor scenes covering diverse spatial layouts and functional contexts, including living rooms, bedrooms, kitchens, and bathrooms.\\nAll scenes contain common household objects that afford human interaction, such as doors, drawers, cabinets, switches, radiators, and supporting furniture.\\nFor each scene, we provide three canonical RGB-D views captured from different viewpoints, where each view consists of an RGB image, a depth image, and pixel-level mask annotations for key affordance-bearing elements (e.g., door handles, knobs, floors, and supporting surfaces).\\nUsing known camera parameters, the three views are back-projected and fused into a unified 3D point cloud, which serves as the geometric input for all interaction synthesis methods.\\nFor each scene, we manually define two types of interaction settings: functional human-scene interaction (functional HSI) and non-functional human-scene interaction (general HSI).\\nFunctional HSI requires the human to interact with a specific functional element to accomplish a task objective (e.g., open the door, adjust the room temperature, dial a number on the telephone), while non-functional HSI involves generic body-scene interactions that do not rely on object functionality (e.g., sit on the floor, stand in front of the window).\\nEach interaction setting is paired with a single text prompt per scene, resulting in a total of 60 curated interaction tasks (30 functional and 30 non-functional).\\nThe functional interaction prompts are designed to cover a diverse range of manipulation affordances, including pinch_pull, hook_pull, tip_push, rotate, plug_in, unplug, and key_press.\\nMost tasks involve fine-grained hand-object interactions, intentionally emphasizing functional reasoning and precise contact modeling rather than coarse body placement alone.\\nAll methods are evaluated on the same set of scenes, views, and text prompts without additional training or scene-specific tuning.\\nThe reconstructed scene geometry and affordance annotations are reused across different interaction prompts within each scene to ensure consistent and fair comparison.\\n\\n\\n\\nReal-world city scenes.\\n\\nTo evaluate the generalization ability of FunHSI under open-world conditions, we additionally collect a set of real-world city scenes captured in public environments.\\nAll data are captured using an iPhone 14 Pro Max. For each scene, we take multiple RGB images from different viewpoints. We use GeoCalib\\u00a0[36] to estimate the camera intrinsic parameters and the gravity direction, and use MapAnything\\u00a0[15] to estimate the camera poses, the depth maps, and the 3D scene point cloud.\\n\\n\\nThe collected scenes include diverse outdoor and semi-outdoor environments such as building entrances, staircases, ticket machines, escalators, benches, and public facilities, featuring challenging factors including clutter, reflective surfaces, varying illumination, and unconstrained object layouts.\\nWe apply the same processing pipeline as in indoor scenes without any scene-specific tuning.\\nThis experimental setting allows us to assess whether FunHSI can generalize beyond curated indoor datasets and reliably synthesize function-aware human-scene interactions in real-world, unconstrained environments.\\n\\n\\n\", \"Appendix C Implementation Details\": \"\\n\\nAppendix C Implementation Details\\n\\nAll our experiments are conducted on a single NVIDIA A6000 GPU.\\nFor functionality grounding and contact reasoning, we use Gemini-2.5-Flash for functional element identification, Gemini Robotics-ER-1.5 for bounding box localization, and GPT-4o for contact graph generation.\\nAll vision-language model queries are performed in a zero-shot manner, without task-specific fine-tuning.\\nScene reconstruction is performed by back-projecting three posed RGB-D views into a unified point cloud using known camera parameters.\\nFunctional and supporting elements are segmented using SAM-ViT-H and lifted into 3D.\\nThe reconstructed scene geometry and functional element annotations are cached and reused across different interaction prompts within the same scene.\\nHuman body initialization is obtained via image-space human inpainting using Gemini.\\nTo reduce hallucinations, we apply a generator-evaluator loop with at most four iterations.\\nInitial 3D human parameters are estimated using CameraHMR\\u00a0[26] for body pose and WiLoR\\u00a0[30] for hand pose.\\nFor occluded hands, we initialize the hand pose using the relaxed SMPL-X default configuration.\\nBody refinement is performed using the two-stage optimization procedure described in Algorithm\\u00a01.\\nWe use the AdamW optimizer for both stages.\\nIn Stage\\u00a01, we optimize the 3D translation, gravity-axis global rotation, and arm pose parameters for K1=400K_{1}=400 iterations with learning rate \\u03b71=1\\u00d710\\u22122\\\\eta_{1}=1\\\\times 10^{-2}.\\nIn Stage\\u00a02, we optimize the full body pose and translation for K2=200K_{2}=200 iterations using a reduced learning rate \\u03b72=\\u03b71/5\\\\eta_{2}=\\\\eta_{1}/5, together with the VPoser prior.\\nUnless otherwise specified, all hyperparameters are fixed across scenes and prompts.\\n\\n\", \"Appendix D More Experimental Analysis\": \"\\n\\nAppendix D More Experimental Analysis\\n\\nAdditional results on real-world cenes.\\n\\nFig.\\u00a012 presents additional qualitative results of our FunHSI on real-world scenes captured in public environments.\\nThese scenes exhibit significantly higher visual and geometric complexity than indoor datasets, including cluttered backgrounds, irregular lighting conditions, reflective surfaces, and diverse object appearances.\\nGiven three posed RGB-D views and a task-level text prompt, FunHSI successfully synthesizes functionally appropriate human-scene interactions without scene-specific tuning.\\nAs shown in the figure, our method correctly identifies task-relevant functional elements and generates plausible interactions for a wide range of actions, such as taking escalators or elevators, buying tickets from vending machines, opening doors, pinning objects to a whiteboard, and interacting with urban furniture.\\nThese results demonstrate that FunHSI generalizes beyond curated indoor datasets and is capable of handling open-world scenes while preserving functional grounding, contact correctness, and physical plausibility.\\n\\n\\n\\nGeneration Diversity.\\n\\nFig.\\u00a013 illustrates the diversity of human-scene interactions generated by FunHSI under the same scene and task prompt.\\nFor each example, we visualize multiple valid 3D human poses that differ in body configuration, viewpoint, and spatial arrangement, while consistently preserving the intended functional contact.\\nSpecifically, FunHSI produces diverse interaction realizations for tasks such as opening a drawer, dialing a telephone, and opening a door, all of which maintain correct contact with the task-relevant functional elements.\\nThese variations arise from differences in initial image synthesis and subsequent geometric refinement, rather than changes in task specification.\\nThis result demonstrates that FunHSI does not collapse to a single canonical pose, but instead supports diverse yet functionally consistent human-scene interaction generation.\\n\\n\\n\\nHuman Inpainting Examples.\\n\\nFig.\\u00a03 presents representative examples of task-conditioned human inpainting in our pipeline.\\nGiven an input RGB image and a task-level functional prompt, the inpainting model synthesizes a human that is spatially consistent with the scene layout and roughly aligned with the intended interaction region.\\nImportantly, the inpainted humans already reflect coarse functional intent (e.g., reaching, crouching, or bending), providing a semantically meaningful and visually grounded initialization that reduces ambiguity in subsequent 3D reconstruction.\\n\\n\\n\\nBody and Hand Pose Estimation Examples.\\n\\nBased on the inpainted images in Fig.\\u00a03, we estimate the initial 3D SMPL-X body pose together with articulated hand poses.\\nThe estimated poses capture coarse body configuration and hand-object alignment in image space, including which hand is used and its approximate contact location.\\nThese estimates serve as strong initialization for our geometry-aware body refinement, significantly improving optimization stability, accelerating convergence, and reducing failure cases such as incorrect hand assignment or implausible body configurations.\\n\\n\\nFigure 15: \\nLayout of the perceptual study. Below the instructions, participants are presented with a target task label and three images: the original empty scene in the middle, and two candidate images on the sides depicting rendered human-scene interactions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"Appendix E User Study Details\": \"\\n\\nAppendix E User Study Details\\n\\nWe conduct a perceptual study on the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform over results rendered in 30 different scenes, evaluating a functional and a non-functional interaction prompt for each scene.\\nDuring the study, we present users with paired results\\u2014one from our method and one from a baseline. Users choose the result they prefer according to our criteria, and we report the percentage of cases in which the baseline is preferred over our method.\\nThe layout of the perceptual study is shown in Fig.\\u00a015.\\n\\n\\nWe take several precautions in our study design to ensure reliable results. We only allow participants that are experienced (\\u22655000\\\\geq 5000 accepted submissions) and highly rated (\\u226598%\\\\geq 98\\\\% acceptance rate).\\nEach assignment contains 36 comparisons, i.e. pairs of images. The first three are intended as warm-up tasks, and the answers to these are discarded during evaluation. There are three so-called catch trials scattered among the remainder of the assignment. These are intentionally very obvious comparisons that help us identify participants who are providing random inputs. We discard all submissions where even a single one of the three catch trials is failed: 25 out of a total of 120 completions. To further reduce bias, the order of the comparisons is shuffled within an assignment, and the two sides of each comparison are randomly swapped too.\\n\\n\"}, \"bibliography\": {\"[1]\": \"\\n[1]\\nB.

Recent systems  (lu2024aiscientist; yamada2025aiscientistv2; gottweis_towards_2025) demonstrate that LLM-based agents can autonomously execute an end-to-end research loop, including literature review, code generation, experiment execution, and manuscript drafting. These results suggest that automated scientific discovery is becoming practically feasible and that LLM-based agents are approaching a level of functional completeness required for autonomous research (jin_agentreview_2024; sahu_reviewertoo_2025; ajith2024litsearch; zhang_noveltybench_2025; zhang2026opennovelty).\\n\\n\\nDespite this progress, existing systems remain constrained by a fundamental inefficiency in their execution paradigm, which limits their scalability and robustness in practice. In particular, most current research agents (wang_openhands_2025; yang_swe-agent_2024; mitchener_kosmos_2025; luo2025llm4sr) rely on an on-the-spot computation strategy, where nearly all information acquisition, reasoning, and synthesis are performed online at runtime. Under this paradigm, each new research attempt requires the agent to dynamically retrieve large volumes of scientific literature, read and summarize long and heterogeneous documents in real time, and explore a broad space of candidate methods and experimental designs through open-ended generation and trial-and-error. As a result, the cost of producing a single effective scientific discovery remains substantial. For example, a complete execution of the overall pipeline often requires several hours and, in some cases, up to 15 hours to progress from ideation to experimentation (lu2024aiscientist). Similarly, in (schmidgall_agent_2025), literature review and experimental planning alone account for a significant portion of total inference time and place heavy demands on the language model\\u2019s ability to maintain coherent reasoning over long contexts. More importantly, this runtime-centric design repeatedly forces the model to re-process large volumes of unstructured and partially redundant information, even when much of the underlying scientific knowledge is already well established, thereby increasing computational overhead and exacerbating the risk of hallucination and reasoning errors (wang2025repomaster; shin_mind_2025).\\n\\n\\nTo address the efficiency and reliability limitations of existing autonomous research agents, we propose Idea2Story, a scientific discovery framework that explicitly separates offline knowledge construction from online research generation, with the goal of reducing repeated reasoning over scientific literature and alleviating the context window bottleneck of large language models. Most current systems rely on runtime-centric execution, where agents repeatedly retrieve, read, summarize, and reason over large collections of highly overlapping papers for each new research attempt, resulting in substantial computational cost and prolonged execution time. Idea2Story mitigates this inefficiency by shifting literature understanding from online reasoning to an offline stage. In the offline phase, the system periodically collects recently accepted, peer-reviewed papers together with their full review feedback, extracts core methodological units and research patterns, and organizes these units and their observed composition relations into a continuously updated structured knowledge graph. This knowledge graph serves as a compact and reusable representation of established scientific methods and their empirical compatibility, replacing repeated processing of raw documents at runtime. Building on this offline knowledge infrastructure, Idea2Story performs online research generation by aligning underspecified user research intents with existing research paradigms encoded in the knowledge graph. Rather than relying on open-ended generation and trial-and-error, the system retrieves high-quality research patterns as structured compositions of method units, which act as stable methodological blueprints for downstream experimental design and execution. Guided by these validated research patterns, Idea2Story conducts feasibility-driven experimentation and ultimately generates a complete, submission-ready paper in an end-to-end manner.\\n\\n\\nFigure 1:  Overview of the two-stage framework in Idea2Story. The offline stage constructs a structured knowledge graph by extracting and organizing reusable method units from a curated paper corpus. The online stage retrieves and composes research patterns from the knowledge graph to ground underspecified user intent into concrete and coherent research directions.\\n\\n\\nOur work makes the following contributions to autonomous scientific discovery :\\n(1) We introduce Idea2Story, a framework that formalizes autonomous research as a\\npre-computation\\u2013driven process, where scientific knowledge is extracted, structured, and\\nmaintained in a continuously updated methodological knowledge graph, addressing the inefficiency and\\nunreliability of runtime-centric research agents. (2) We propose a knowledge-grounded planning and execution pipeline that alleviates the context window bottleneck and reduces repeated runtime reasoning over literature by converting paper reading into retrieval over a pre-built knowledge graph. (3) We conduct preliminary empirical studies and comparative evaluations, demonstrating that Idea2Story can produce several high-quality research demos and establishing the practical feasibility of the proposed paradigm in an end-to-end setting.\\n\\n\", \"2 Related Work\": \"\\n\\n2 Related Work\\n\\n\\n2.1 Autonomous Scientific Discovery\\n\\nRecent advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven growing interest in autonomous scientific\\ndiscovery agents that aim to automate the full research lifecycle, from code generation to experimental\\nexecution  (hu_controlled_2026; zhang2025evolving; lin_se-agent_2025). Early systems such as The AI Scientist (v1) (lu2024aiscientist) demonstrate the\\nviability of end-to-end automation but rely heavily on manually crafted code templates and largely\\nlinear exploration workflows, which restrict discovery depth and adaptability. Later approaches, including\\nThe AI Scientist-v2 (yamada2025aiscientistv2) and Kosmos (mitchener_kosmos_2025), reduce reliance on\\nexplicit template through the incorporation of agentic tree search and experiment management agents, enabling iterative and multi-round exploration.\\n\\n\\nIn research ideation, LLM-generated ideas are often perceived as highly novel during initial screening; however, prior studies (si2024can) uncover a critical paradox whereby such ideas tend to underperform after implementation relative to human-generated ideas, indicating limited feasibility and practical\\nutility. As more ideas are generated, LLM outputs exhibit growing similarity, leading to diminished meaningful diversity. Similar limitations have also been observed in research evaluation and peer\\nreview (liang2024can; xu2025can; thakkar_can_2025; zhang2026opennovelty). Existing AI-based reviewers display systematic blind\\nspots: shin_mind_2025 shows that LLM reviewers place disproportionate\\nemphasis on technical correctness while undervaluing novelty, deviating from human\\nexpert judgment, while sahu_reviewertoo_2025 demonstrates that AI reviewers\\nstruggle to distinguish fine-grained acceptance categories and are susceptible to sycophancy, with\\nreview scores increasing unreasonably after exposure to author rebuttals. Although recent approaches\\nsuch as AgentReview (jin_agentreview_2024) seek to mitigate these deficiencies by simulating\\ndiverse reviewer roles, automated evaluation systems remain less reliable than human experts in\\nidentifying robust accept/reject decision boundaries.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2.2 LLM-Driven Agents\\n\\nLLM-driven agents still struggle to interact effectively with complex real-world environments.\\nDespite their strong generative capabilities, many existing systems\\u2014such as OpenHands (wang_openhands_2025)\\nand SWE-Agent (yang_swe-agent_2024)\\u2014exhibit limited performance when applied to realistic\\ncodebases. These limitations largely stem from insufficient reasoning over hierarchical dependencies\\nand structural constraints, as well as the inherent restrictions imposed by finite context windows.\\nAs a result, LLM-driven agents achieve relatively low task completion rates on challenging benchmarks\\nsuch as MLE-bench (chan_mlebench_2024) and SciCode (tian_scicode_2024).\\nRepoMaster (wang2025repomaster) further identifies inadequate modeling of codebase structure,\\nincluding function call graphs and module dependency graphs, as a key bottleneck for LLM-driven agents\\noperating in large and complex environments.\\n\\n\\nBeyond execution limitations, LLM-driven agents also exhibit notable deficiencies in scientific rigor\\nand evaluative judgment. When tasked with autonomous assessment, these agents are prone to hallucination and overconfidence. For instance, Agent Laboratory (schmidgall_agent_2025) reports that automated evaluations produced by LLM-driven agents substantially overestimate paper quality compared to human reviewers. Evaluations of Kosmos (mitchener_kosmos_2025) further reveal a tendency to invent opaque quantitative metrics and to conflate statistical significance with scientific value, leading to weak interpretability of experimental conclusions. Moreover, long-horizon autonomous execution exacerbates these issues by introducing behavioral\\ndrift (arike2025tech), where LLM-driven agents gradually deviate from intended research trajectories or generate overly strong and insufficiently justified claims (lu2024aiscientist; schmidgall2025agent; baek_researchagent_2025; hong_metagpt_2023; wu_autogen_2023; lin_se-agent_2025; hu_controlled_2026). This drift further undermines reliability and highlights the\\nneed for stronger structural grounding and validation mechanisms in LLM-based autonomous research\\nsystems.\\n\\n\\n\", \"3 General Idea Generation\": \"\\n\\n3 General Idea Generation\\n\\nIdea2Story is designed to interact with users through high-level and often informal research ideas\\nthat reflect human intuition rather than fully specified technical plans.

Instead of performing document-level reasoning at runtime, Idea2Story\\npre-computes a structured representation of prior work that captures both methodological\\nabstractions and their observed compatibility in accepted research. This stage consists of three\\nmain components: (i) constructing a curated paper pool from peer-reviewed venues, (ii) extracting\\ncore method units that represent reusable methodological contributions, and (iii) organizing these\\nunits and their composition relations into a structured knowledge graph. Together, these components\\nform a persistent methodological memory that decouples literature understanding from downstream\\nidea grounding and research generation.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1.1 Paper Pool Construction\\n\\nWe construct a paper pool from accepted machine learning papers and their associated peer reviews\\ncollected from top-tier conferences. Let \\ud835\\udc9e={NeurIPS,ICLR}\\\\mathcal{C}=\\\\{\\\\text{NeurIPS},\\\\text{ICLR}\\\\} denote the\\nset of venues considered, and let \\ud835\\udcaf\\\\mathcal{T} denote the most recent three-year time window.\\nThe resulting paper pool is defined as\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udcab={p\\u2223p\\u200b\\u00a0is an accepted paper from\\u00a0\\u200bc\\u2208\\ud835\\udc9e\\u200b\\u00a0during\\u00a0\\u200b\\ud835\\udcaf},\\\\mathcal{P}=\\\\{\\\\,p\\\\mid p\\\\text{ is an accepted paper from }c\\\\in\\\\mathcal{C}\\\\text{ during }\\\\mathcal{T}\\\\,\\\\},\\n\\n\\n\\nwhich consists of approximately 5,000 papers from NeurIPS and 8,000 papers from ICLR.

Formally, we model method unit extraction as a mapping\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2130:p~\\u2192\\ud835\\udcb0p={up(1),\\u2026,up(Kp)},\\\\mathcal{E}:\\\\tilde{p}\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathcal{U}_{p}=\\\\{u_{p}^{(1)},\\\\dots,u_{p}^{(K_{p})}\\\\},\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere p~\\u2208\\ud835\\udcab~\\\\tilde{p}\\\\in\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}} denotes a single paper and \\ud835\\udcb0p\\\\mathcal{U}_{p} is a small set\\nof method units that capture its essential technical ideas.\\n\\n\\nAs illustrated in Figure 2, the extraction procedure leverages the standardized structure of\\nacademic papers and analyzes different sections to collect complementary methodological signals.\\nLet \\ud835\\udc31p=(introp,methodp,expp)\\\\mathbf{x}_{p}=(\\\\text{intro}_{p},\\\\text{method}_{p},\\\\text{exp}_{p}) denote the partition of a paper\\ninto its introduction, method, and experiments sections. The introduction is used to identify the\\nhigh-level research motivation and the precise problem formulation, the method section provides\\nsignals about core technical mechanisms such as modeling assumptions, learning objectives, model\\narchitectures, and optimization strategies, and the experiments section reflects how these\\nmechanisms are instantiated and evaluated in practice. By jointly aggregating information from\\nthese sections, the extractor isolates method units that correspond to the primary algorithmic or\\nmodeling contributions of the paper, rather than surface-level experimental details.\\n\\n\\nWe define a method unit u\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb0pu\\\\in\\\\mathcal{U}_{p} as a self-contained description of how a research\\nproblem is formulated or solved, abstracted away from specific implementation choices and\\nexperimental configurations. Elements that primarily involve dataset selection, hyperparameter\\ntuning, or engineering-level optimizations are excluded unless they induce substantive changes to\\nthe problem formulation, model structure, or learning objective. In practice, most papers yield one\\nor a small number of method units. Each extracted unit is further normalized into structured\\nmethodological attributes, including atomic meta-methods, which correspond to indivisible\\nmethodological elements, and composition-level patterns, which describe how multiple method\\nunits are combined within a single paper.\\n\\n\\nAfter extracting method units for all papers, we represent each paper p\\u2208\\ud835\\udcab~p\\\\in\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}}\\nby a vector embedding derived from its associated method units. Formally, let\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc33p=g\\u200b(\\ud835\\udcb0p),\\\\mathbf{z}_{p}=g(\\\\mathcal{U}_{p}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udcb0p\\\\mathcal{U}_{p} denotes the set of extracted method units for paper pp and\\ng\\u200b(\\u22c5)g(\\\\cdot) is an embedding function that maps a set of method units to a fixed-dimensional\\nrepresentation.\\n\\n\\nTo induce higher-level research patterns, we first apply a nonlinear dimensionality reduction\\noperator\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc32p=UMAP\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc33p),\\\\mathbf{y}_{p}=\\\\mathrm{UMAP}(\\\\mathbf{z}_{p}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhich projects the high-dimensional embeddings into a lower-dimensional space while preserving\\nlocal semantic neighborhoods. We then perform density-based clustering on the reduced\\nrepresentations using DBSCAN, yielding a partition\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc9e={C1,\\u2026,CM},\\\\mathcal{C}=\\\\{C_{1},\\\\dots,C_{M}\\\\},\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere each cluster Cm\\u2282\\ud835\\udcab~C_{m}\\\\subset\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}} corresponds to a coherent research pattern.\\n\\n\\nThese induced clusters serve as higher-level abstractions over individual papers, capturing\\nrecurring methodological structures that are reused across the literature. The resulting research\\npatterns form the basis for subsequent retrieval and composition.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2:  Offline knowledge graph construction in Idea2Story. Academic papers and their associated review artifacts are first anonymized and safety-filtered, then deconstructed into layered methodological representations. These layers capture complementary aspects of a paper, including its core research idea, domain context, high-level story skeleton, and packaging actions. The extracted elements are normalized into atomic method units and meta-methods, which are connected through composition and similarity relations. Reviewer feedback is incorporated as additional signals to refine relations and validate abstractions. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1.3 Knowledge Graph Construction\\n\\nBuilding on the extracted method units, we organize reusable methodological components into a\\nstructured knowledge graph that supports systematic method discovery and composition. While\\nindividual method units capture isolated algorithmic or modeling ideas, effective research methods\\nin practice typically arise from structured combinations of multiple method units. The knowledge\\ngraph provides a unified representation that explicitly encodes canonicalized method units,\\nmeta-methods, and their empirically observed composition relations in prior work.\\n\\n\\nFormally, we define the knowledge graph as a directed graph\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud835\\udca2=(\\ud835\\udcb1,\\u2130),\\\\mathcal{G}=(\\\\mathcal{V},\\\\mathcal{E}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere each node v\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb1v\\\\in\\\\mathcal{V} corresponds to a canonicalized method unit or a meta-method.\\nCanonicalization groups semantically similar method units across the corpus into shared\\nmeta-method abstractions, reducing surface-level variation while preserving core methodological\\nintent. As a result, nodes in the graph represent atomic or minimally indivisible methodological\\nelements that are reused across papers.\\n\\n\\nEdges in the graph encode composition relations between method units. For a given paper\\np\\u2208\\ud835\\udcab~p\\\\in\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{P}} with extracted method unit set \\ud835\\udcb0p\\\\mathcal{U}_{p}, we add directed edges\\nbetween pairs of method units (ui,uj)\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb0p\\u00d7\\ud835\\udcb0p(u_{i},u_{j})\\\\in\\\\mathcal{U}_{p}\\\\times\\\\mathcal{U}_{p} to indicate that\\nthey are jointly instantiated as part of the same methodological pipeline. These edges capture\\nempirical evidence of method compatibility observed in prior work, reflecting how different\\nmethod units are combined in practice rather than hypothetical or manually specified relations.\\n\\n\\nAggregating composition relations across the full corpus yields a graph structure that encodes both\\nmethodological abstraction and empirical compatibility. In particular, the graph captures two\\ncomplementary levels of structure: (i) reusable methodological elements represented as\\ncanonicalized method units and meta-methods, and (ii) composition constraints induced from\\nco-occurrence statistics in accepted papers. This separation allows Idea2Story to reason about\\nmethods at a higher level of abstraction than individual papers, while remaining grounded in\\nobserved research practice.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2 Online Research Generation.\\n\\nGiven a target research objective, Idea2Story treats method discovery as a graph-based retrieval and\\ncomposition problem over \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G}. The system retrieves relevant subgraphs and composes\\ncompatible method units by following connectivity constraints in the graph, producing candidate\\nresearch patterns that correspond to structured combinations of method units. These research\\npatterns serve as high-level methodological blueprints that bridge abstract research intent and\\nconcrete experimental design, enabling downstream planning, feasibility analysis, and end-to-end\\npaper generation.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2.1 Research Pattern Retrieval\\n\\nGiven a user-provided research idea expressed in natural language, we formulate research pattern\\nidentification as a structured retrieval problem over the knowledge graph \\ud835\\udca2\\\\mathcal{G}. Let\\nqq denote the input research idea, and let \\ud835\\udc9e={C1,\\u2026,CM}\\\\mathcal{C}=\\\\{C_{1},\\\\dots,C_{M}\\\\} denote the set of\\nresearch patterns induced from the paper corpus. The goal is to rank patterns in \\ud835\\udc9e\\\\mathcal{C}\\naccording to their relevance to qq.\\n\\n\\nRather than relying on a single similarity metric, Idea2Story adopts a multi-view retrieval\\nformulation that aggregates complementary signals from different semantic abstractions. Formally,\\nfor each research pattern CmC_{m}, we compute a relevance score\\n\\n\\n\\ns\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)=\\u2211v\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb1\\u03bbv\\u200bsv\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q),s(C_{m}\\\\mid q)=\\\\sum_{v\\\\in\\\\mathcal{V}}\\\\lambda_{v}\\\\,s_{v}(C_{m}\\\\mid q),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udcb1={idea,domain,paper}\\\\mathcal{V}=\\\\{\\\\text{idea},\\\\text{domain},\\\\text{paper}\\\\} indexes the retrieval views,\\nsv\\u200b(\\u22c5)s_{v}(\\\\cdot) denotes a view-specific scoring function, and \\u03bbv\\\\lambda_{v} are fixed weighting\\ncoefficients that balance the contribution of different views.\\n\\n\\nIdea-level retrieval.\\n\\nAt the idea level, the system retrieves previously observed research ideas that are semantically\\nsimilar to the input query qq. Let \\u2110\\\\mathcal{I} denote the set of stored research ideas extracted\\nfrom the corpus, and let simidea\\u200b(q,i)\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{idea}}(q,i) denote a semantic similarity function\\nbetween qq and an idea i\\u2208\\u2110i\\\\in\\\\mathcal{I}. The idea-level score of a research pattern CmC_{m} is\\ncomputed by aggregating the similarity scores of ideas associated with the pattern:\\n\\n\\n\\nsidea\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)=maxi\\u2208\\u2110\\u200b(Cm)\\u2061simidea\\u200b(q,i),s_{\\\\text{idea}}(C_{m}\\\\mid q)=\\\\max_{i\\\\in\\\\mathcal{I}(C_{m})}\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{idea}}(q,i),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u2110\\u200b(Cm)\\\\mathcal{I}(C_{m}) denotes the set of ideas linked to pattern CmC_{m}.\\n\\n\\n\\nDomain-level retrieval.\\n\\nAt the domain level, the system interprets the input idea qq in terms of its underlying research\\ndomains and methodological themes. Let \\ud835\\udc9f\\\\mathcal{D} denote the set of research domains, and let\\nsimdomain\\u200b(q,d)\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{domain}}(q,d) measure the relevance between qq and domain d\\u2208\\ud835\\udc9fd\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}.\\nThe domain-level score of pattern CmC_{m} is computed as\\n\\n\\n\\nsdomain\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)=\\u2211d\\u2208\\ud835\\udc9f\\u200b(Cm)simdomain\\u200b(q,d)\\u200bw\\u200b(d,Cm),s_{\\\\text{domain}}(C_{m}\\\\mid q)=\\\\sum_{d\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}(C_{m})}\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{domain}}(q,d)\\\\,w(d,C_{m}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\ud835\\udc9f\\u200b(Cm)\\\\mathcal{D}(C_{m}) denotes the domains associated with pattern CmC_{m}, and w\\u200b(d,Cm)w(d,C_{m}) captures\\nempirical effectiveness signals derived from the knowledge graph.\\n\\n\\n\\nPaper-level retrieval.\\n\\nAt the paper level, the system retrieves papers whose technical content is semantically aligned\\nwith the input idea. Let \\ud835\\udcab\\u200b(Cm)\\\\mathcal{P}(C_{m}) denote the set of papers instantiating pattern CmC_{m}.\\nThe paper-level score is computed as\\n\\n\\n\\nspaper\\u200b(Cm\\u2223q)=maxp\\u2208\\ud835\\udcab\\u200b(Cm)\\u2061simpaper\\u200b(q,p)\\u22c5\\u03b1\\u200b(p),s_{\\\\text{paper}}(C_{m}\\\\mid q)=\\\\max_{p\\\\in\\\\mathcal{P}(C_{m})}\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{paper}}(q,p)\\\\cdot\\\\alpha(p),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere simpaper\\u200b(q,p)\\\\mathrm{sim}_{\\\\text{paper}}(q,p) measures semantic similarity between qq and paper pp,\\nand \\u03b1\\u200b(p)\\\\alpha(p) denotes a quality-related weight derived from peer review metadata.\\n\\n\\nThe final ranked list of research patterns is obtained by ordering patterns according to their\\naggregated multi-view relevance scores.

In each iteration, a large language model is prompted to act as a reviewer\\nand evaluate the current research pattern along several predefined criteria, including technical\\nsoundness, novelty with respect to existing literature, and overall clarity of the problem\\u2013method\\nalignment.

Based on this corpus, we first analyze the properties of the extracted method units to assess whether Idea2Story captures meaningful and reusable methodological abstractions. We then present qualitative demonstrations of research patterns instantiated as structured research stories, illustrating how the system transforms vague research intent into coherent and methodologically grounded research directions.\\n\\n\\n\\nCase 1: Method Unit Extraction Demo\\n\\n\\nPaper Title:\\nLearning Dynamics of LLM Finetuning\\nBase Problem:\\nUnderstanding how specific training examples influence model predictions during finetuning is challenging, particularly in large language models.\\nSolution Pattern:\\nDevelop a framework to analyze step-wise influence accumulation among potential responses during finetuning, providing insights into phenomena like hallucination and the squeezing effect in off-policy direct preference optimization.\\nStory:\\nReframe the understanding of LLM finetuning through the lens of learning dynamics, offering a unified interpretation of training behaviors and inspiring methods to enhance model alignment and performance.\\nApplication:\\nImproving alignment in large language models, enhancing finetuning strategies for better model performance, diagnosing and mitigating hallucination in AI systems.\\n\\nFigure 3: An example of a method unit extracted from an accepted paper, illustrating the separation of the base problem, solution pattern, and higher-level research story.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.1 Implementation Details\\n\\nTo further assess the effectiveness of Idea2Story in practical research ideation settings, we\\nconduct additional qualitative experiments on a small set of representative cases. Specifically,\\nwe evaluate three user-provided research ideas curated by an external collaborator. For each case,\\nIdea2Story generates research patterns using the GLM-4.7 (zeng2025glm) model as the underlying language backbone. As a baseline, we compare against direct LLM generation, where the same model is prompted to produce a complete research story without explicit pattern modeling or retrieval.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.2 Case Study: Method Unit Extraction\\n\\nWe present a representative case study to illustrate the behavior of the proposed method unit\\nextraction agent. Case 1 shows an example extracted from an accepted paper, where the system decomposes the full paper into a structured set of methodological elements.\\n\\n\\nAs shown in the example, the extracted method unit explicitly separates the underlying research\\nproblem, the core solution pattern, and the resulting research story. The Base Problem describes the core challenge addressed by the paper, namely understanding how individual training examples influence model behavior during finetuning, without depending on specific datasets or implementation details. The Solution Pattern summarizes the central methodological idea as\\nan analysis framework for step-wise influence accumulation, highlighting the key mechanism without\\nbinding it to a particular optimization setup or experimental configuration. Importantly, the extracted Story reframes the technical contribution at a higher level of\\nabstraction, connecting learning dynamics to broader phenomena such as hallucination and alignment\\nin large language models. This abstraction reflects how the method unit goes beyond algorithmic\\ndetails to capture the conceptual contribution of the paper. Finally, the Application\\nfield grounds the method unit by indicating downstream research and system-level implications,\\nwithout enumerating task-specific benchmarks.\\n\\n\\nThis example demonstrates that the extraction agent isolates reusable methodological structure while\\nfiltering out implementation-level details. By representing the paper as a coherent method unit\\nrather than a collection of experimental components, Idea2Story enables subsequent reuse,\\ncomparison, and composition of methodological ideas across papers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3 Knowledge Graph Analysis\\n\\nWe analyze the structure of the constructed knowledge graph to understand how extracted method\\nunits are distributed across papers and research domains. As illustrated in Figure 2, the graph\\nexhibits a clear hub-and-spoke structure, where a small number of high-frequency domains connect\\nto a large number of papers and research patterns. This reflects the uneven distribution of\\nresearch activity across domains, while also highlighting domains that function as central hubs\\nfor methodological reuse. Importantly, many research patterns are observed to connect multiple\\ndomains simultaneously, indicating that the extracted method units often capture methodological\\nabstractions that generalize beyond a single application area. In contrast, paper-level nodes are typically associated with a single domain, whereas pattern-level nodes frequently act as bridges between otherwise weakly connected domains.

The main challenge is semantic sparsity caused by short and ambiguous queries.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCore Research Gap\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExisting intent classification methods treat queries in isolation and ignore domain-specific structural priors in e-commerce. They fail to exploit rich relationships between products and attributes, and standard vocabularies struggle with long-tail, domain-specific terminology. No prior work unifies diffusion-based refinement with structural graph embeddings for intent disambiguation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrior work suffers from (1) context isolation, where behavioral signals such as clicks are underutilized, and (2) a flat-label assumption that ignores the hierarchical nature of e-commerce taxonomies, leading to inconsistent predictions for fine-grained, long-tail intents.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMethod Skeleton\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA diffusion-based classifier that iteratively denoises intent representations; a context-aware discrete tokenizer based on a VQ-VAE variant to encode diverse e-commerce queries; and integration of pretrained product graph embeddings as structural priors during the denoising process.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA dual-stream discriminative architecture consisting of a BERT-based text encoder, a lightweight GNN for aggregating behavioral interaction graphs, and a prediction head trained with hierarchical contrastive learning; parameter-efficient adaptation via LoRA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInnovation Claims\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(1) Reformulates intent classification as a diffusion-based dynamic refinement process;\\n(2) Introduces discrete, context-aware intent tokenization to better handle long-tail domain vocabulary;\\n(3) Enhances intent reasoning by incorporating product graph structural embeddings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(1) Contextualized intent modeling via joint reasoning over text and behavioral graphs;\\n(2) Hierarchical contrastive learning leveraging product taxonomies;\\n(3) Parameter-efficient system design achieving strong performance at reduced computational cost.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 1: \\nComparison of research patterns generated by Idea2Story and a direct LLM baseline,\\nboth starting from the same underspecified user input:\\n\\u201cI want to build an e-commerce agent that can better understand user intent.\\u201d\\nThe table contrasts how different generation mechanisms transform the same vague research intent\\ninto concrete research patterns.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.4 Qualitative Comparison of Generated Research Patterns\\n\\nWe further compare the quality of research patterns generated by Idea2Story and a direct LLM\\nbaseline. Both systems start from the same underspecified user input and produce structured\\nresearch proposals, enabling a controlled comparison of how different generation mechanisms\\ntransform vague research intent into concrete research patterns.\\n\\n\\nTable 1 presents a side-by-side comparison of representative outputs along multiple dimensions,\\nincluding problem formulation, methodological structure, and innovation claims. Rather than\\nevaluating surface-level writing quality, the comparison focuses on the resulting research\\npatterns as methodological blueprints\\u2014i.e., how the generated ideas frame the research problem,\\nidentify gaps in prior work, and organize methodological components into a coherent approach. As shown in the table, Idea2Story tends to induce higher-level problem reformulation, transforming\\nintent understanding from a fixed classification task into a dynamic structural reasoning process.\\nThe resulting research pattern emphasizes generative refinement, structural priors, and evolving\\nrepresentations. In contrast, the direct LLM baseline largely operates within a conventional task\\nformulation, proposing a stronger system through the integration of additional components such as\\ncontext modeling and hierarchical objectives.\\n\\n\\nTo reduce evaluation bias, the generated research stories from both approaches are subsequently\\nassessed by an independent large language model (Gemini 3 Pro) (team2025gemma), which is not involved in either generation process. The evaluator is instructed to compare the outputs in terms of novelty, methodological substance, and overall research quality, without access to the generation method\\nused. Across all evaluated cases, the externally evaluated results consistently favor the outputs\\ngenerated by Idea2Story. In particular, the research stories produced by direct LLM generation tend\\nto remain at a high level of abstraction, with less concrete methodological grounding and reliance\\non relatively standard techniques. In contrast, Idea2Story-generated research patterns exhibit\\nclearer problem framing, more specific methodological structures, and stronger signals of novelty.\\n\\n\\n\", \"5 Future Work\": \"\\n\\n5 Future Work\\n\\nWhile Idea2Story focuses on grounding vague research intent into structured and high-quality research patterns, an important direction for future work is to extend this framework toward a fully closed-loop research generation pipeline. A promising extension is the integration of experiment-driven agents that can instantiate, validate, and iteratively refine generated research patterns through empirical feedback, including automated experimental design, dataset selection, and preliminary execution. Experimental outcomes can then serve as additional signals to refine the instantiated research stories, forming a feedback loop between method design and empirical validation. Beyond experimentation, future work may further explore how refined research patterns can be systematically translated into complete paper drafts, covering method descriptions, experimental results, and discussion sections. By grounding paper generation in empirically validated research patterns, such a system could move beyond surface-level text generation and provide more faithful, end-to-end support for executable and publishable scientific discovery.\\n\\n\", \"6 Conclusion\": \"\\n\\n6 Conclusion\\n\\nWe presented Idea2Story, a pre-computation\\u2013driven framework for autonomous scientific discovery that shifts literature understanding from runtime reasoning to offline knowledge structuring. By explicitly extracting reusable method units and organizing them into a continuously updated knowledge graph, Idea2Story enables research agents to reason over stable research patterns rather than repeatedly processing raw papers. Our qualitative analyses and comparative studies show that this design leads to research patterns with clearer problem reformulation, stronger methodological structure, and higher conceptual novelty than direct LLM generation. These results highlight the importance of explicit pattern modeling as a foundation for scalable and reliable autonomous research. Looking ahead, integrating Idea2Story with experimental agents to close the loop from abstract research patterns to validated empirical results represents a promising direction toward fully autonomous and trustworthy scientific discovery.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"}, \"bibliography\": {}, \"domain\": \"cs.CE\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"0a5c9512-73ab-4c8f-a79f-f928b009c126\", \"authors\": [\"Christopher Willby\", \"Tomohiro Hashizume\", \"Jason Crain\", \"Dieter Jaksch\"], \"title\": \"Symplectic Optimization on Gaussian States\", \"abstract\": \"Computing Gaussian ground states via variational optimization is challenging because the covariance matrices must satisfy the uncertainty principle, rendering constrained or Riemannian optimization costly, delicate, and thus difficult to scale, particularly in large and inhomogeneous systems.

This approach enforces all physical constraints exactly, yielding a globally unconstrained variational formulation of the bosonic ground-state problem. The unconstrained structure also naturally supports solution reuse across nearby Hamiltonians: warm-starting from previously optimized covariance matrices substantially reduces the number of optimization steps required for convergence in families of related configurations, as encountered in crystal lattices, molecular systems, and fluids.

Additionally, existing approaches either sacrifice expressivity (e.g., C2-logic in standard R-GNNs) or scalability (e.g., 3-GNNs).

The key barrier has been the absence of a principled, scalable mechanism to approximate higher-order logic (e.g., C3) without full triplet message passing. Our approach differs by introducing R-GNN[t], a parameterized transformation of input atoms that enables a smooth transition from weak to strong approximation of 3-GNNs, leveraging a novel input encoding strategy that avoids explicit triplet embeddings while preserving logical expressivity.

Current methods fail at compositionally complex tasks (e.g., SokoBench beyond 25 moves) due to fragile runtime reasoning and lack of persistent state awareness. Our framework enables *adaptive*, context-sensitive reasoning\u2014learning when and how to activate higher-order features\u2014making it applicable to real-world domains like multi-agent coordination, logistics, and hierarchical task planning. It advances the frontier of **generalizable, interpretable, and scalable** AI agents by unifying symbolic planning with neural generalization.\n\n> **[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**  \n> The core challenge lies in **dynamically controlling complexity** in a way that is both **learnable** and **semantically meaningful**.

We first find that ES is able to reach performance numbers close to GRPO for math and reasoning tasks with a comparable compute budget. However, and most importantly for continual learning, the performance gains in ES is accompanied by significant forgetting of prior abilities, limiting its applicability for training models online. We also explore the reason behind this behavior and show that the updates made using ES are much less sparse and have orders of magnitude larger $\\\\ell_2$ norm compared to corresponding GRPO updates, explaining the contrasting forgetting curves between the two algorithms.

In many real-world settings, models need to adapt to new tasks, user preferences, or data distributions to perform optimally. While modern chatbots like ChatGPT do this by taking notes in the form of user memory OpenAI (2024) and use in-context learning Brown et al. (2020) to incorporate this information, we currently lack solutions that can achieve this by modifying the model weights during deployment. One of the reasons that makes this challenging is that current post-training and adaptation methods for LLMs are exclusively gradient-based, including approaches such as SFT Wei et al. (2022), RLHF (Ouyang et al., 2022), DPO Rafailov et al. (2024), and GRPO (Shao et al., 2024). While effective, these methods require storing gradients, optimizer states, or intermediate activations, causing substantial memory overhead.\\n\\n\\nEvolutionary Strategies (ES) Qiu et al. (2025); Korotyshova et al. (2025) have recently re-emerged as a gradient-free alternative for optimizing LLMs. By estimating updates through population-level perturbations rather than backpropagation, ES avoids explicit gradient storage and can significantly reduce memory requirements during deployment. Qiu et al. (2025) have shown that ES achieves comparable performance to GRPO on the Countdown task Pan (2026), presenting ES as a viable candidate for continual learning in LLMs. However, a more comprehensive analysis on task generalization was missing in their work. More importantly from the perspective of continual learning, Qiu et al. (2025) do not evaluate the extent to which ES preserves existing capabilities while learning new tasks.\\n\\n\\nIn this work, we present a comprehensive empirical analysis of ES for fine-tuning LLMs, with a focus on continual learning and forgetting. We compare ES against GRPO on multiple math and reasoning benchmarks and evaluate forgetting curves over many update steps. Our results confirm that ES is able to reach performance levels comparable to GRPO on a large suite of tasks; however, contrary to results reported in Qiu et al. (2025), we find that GRPO still dominates ES marginally on almost all tasks. Additionally, we show that training LLMs using ES leads to significant model degradation and forgetting of existing abilities when compared to GRPO. To better understand this behavior, we analyze the structure of parameter updates produced by ES and compare them to those obtained using GRPO. We find that ES updates are significantly less sparse and exhibit much larger \\u21132\\\\ell_{2} norms, leading to more global parameter changes that interfere with previously learned capabilities.\\n\\n\\nOur findings highlight that although ES presents a tempting memory-efficient and gradient-free alternative to inference-time model adaptation, it is also accompanied by \\u201ccatastrophic\\u201d forgetting Kirkpatrick et al.

Although implementations such as CMA-ES Hansen and Ostermeier (2001) and natural ES Wierstra et al. (2011); Sun et al. (2012) demonstrated success, initial implementations remained in the million-parameter scale (Such et al., 2018; Risi and Stanley, 2019; Zhang et al., 2017). However, recent updates have brought ES up to scale and in competition with GPRO, leveraging how it is highly parallelizable, Salimans et al. (2017), memory efficient Malladi et al. (2024); Korotyshova et al. (2025), faster Sarkar et al. (2025), robust to sparse reward horizons Salimans et al. (2017), and can be modified with LoRA adaptions Jin et al. (2024); Korotyshova et al. (2025); Sarkar et al. (2025).\\nQiu et al. (2025) recently published a novel implementation of ES and showed that it outperforms GRPO. However, their study lacked a thorough analysis of model degradation during continued training. Additionally, a bulk of their study was focused on a single dataset. We extend their analysis to multiple datasets, evaluate model degradation during fine-tuning and also study the difference in weight updates in ES when compared to GRPO.\\n\\n\", \"3 Experiments\": \"\\n\\n3 Experiments\\n\\n\\n3.1 ES vs GRPO Comparison\\n\\nWe use the ES implementation of Qiu et al. (2025) and compare it with the GRPO Shao et al. (2024) implementation from the VERL libary (Sheng et al., 2025). An algorithmic analogy between the ES and GRPO algorithms can be found in A.1 while implementations details can be found in A.2. We extend the analysis of ES and GRPO to three math and reasoning tasks \\u2013 GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) and OlympiadBench (He et al., 2024), in addition to the Countdown dataset which was extensively studied in prior work Qiu et al. (2025). We perform this study for two models: Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct (Qwen et al., 2024) and Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct (Grattafiori et al., 2024). Following the experimental conditions of Qiu et al. (2025), we train our models on 200 examples from each dataset with identical batch size and number of rollouts.\\n\\n\\nThe results for comparison between ES and GRPO for fine-tuning LLMs can be found in Table 1. We see that for both models, ES is within 3-4 percentage points of GRPO in terms of task performance. These results are in contrast to prior work by Qiu et al. (2025), who claim that ES significantly outperforms GRPO on the Countdown task. In our experiments, we see that although ES performance numbers are close to GRPO, GRPO still outperforms ES for all but the GSM8K dataset with Llama-3.2-1B model. Therefore, we find different relative performance trends than those reported in prior work, which may stem from differences in GRPO implementations, hyperparameter choices, or evaluation protocols.

This makes the compute requirements of ES also comparable to GRPO.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2 ES and Catastrophic Forgetting\\n\\nWhile Section 3.1 shows that ES performs competitively with GRPO on various downstream tasks, a defining factor in the viability of using a fine-tuning algorithm for continual learning is its relationship with catastrophic forgetting. We utilized Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct trained on the Countdown dataset with GRPO and ES to evaluate catastrophic forgetting. HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019) was used to evaluate LLMs on their prior capabilities. In an ideal scenario, performance on previous tasks should be preserved as new capability is gained. We thus evaluate task performance across each checkpoint of our trained models.\\n\\n\\nFigure 1: Pareto front between new task (Countdown) and old task (HellaSwag) performance across fine-tuning with ES and GRPO.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: Prior task accuracy (%; HellaSwag) vs. training iteration for ES and GRPO fine-tuning. GRPO-trained models exhibit stable prior task accuracy across training iteration, while ES-trained models degrade with continued fine-tuning.\\n\\n\\nFigure\\u00a01 illustrates the relationship between new-task performance (Countdown) and prior-task performance (HellaSwag) across fine-tuning iterations. When training with ES, prior-task performance systematically deteriorates as fine-tuning proceeds, even after new-task performance has effectively converged. This can observed in the convex Pareto front made by ES in Figure\\u00a01. The darker color dots, which depict early training iterations begin with a lower \\u201cNew Task Accuracy\\u201d. With enough training iterations, the increase in \\u201cNew Task Accuracy\\u201d for ES is accompanied by a gradual but evident decline in \\u201cPrior Task Accuracy\\u201d. Additionally, ES models reach near-maximum Countdown performance by approximately 200 iterations, after which additional training yields negligible gains on the new task. As shown in Figure 2, despite this convergence, previous task performance continues to decline with further iterations, resulting in an approximately 10% drop relative to the best observed prior-task performance. This pattern indicates that continued ES optimization disproportionately harms previously acquired capabilities, rather than trading off against improvements on the new task.\\n\\n\\nIn contrast, models fine-tuned with GRPO exhibit markedly different behavior. Across the full range of training iterations, GRPO maintains stable previous task performance while achieving strong new task accuracy. This can be seen by the cluster of crosses on the top-right corner of Figure\\u00a01. This suggests that GRPO avoids the destructive interference observed with ES. This property of GRPO has also been observed in prior work Shenfeld et al. (2025).\\n\\n\\nTherefore, we see that although ES-trained models can be competitive to GRPO, they do so at the cost of severe catastrophic forgetting. Notably, this forgetting occurs within a single fine-tuning run rather than across sequential tasks, highlighting a fundamental instability in ES-based continual adaptation. These results suggest that ES is poorly suited for scenarios requiring task generalization or reuse of previously learned capabilities, whereas GRPO provides a substantially more stable fine-tuning regime.\\n\\n\\nFigure 3: \\nRelationship between Frobenius norm of a model update and number of training iterations on a new task. ES-trained models drift several orders of magnitude more than GRPO-trained models.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3 Dissecting ES Updates: Norm and Sparsity\\n\\nIn this section, we seek to determine the characteristics of fine-tuning with ES that cause catastrophic forgetting. We do this by analyzing two features: the update norm and sparsity.\\n\\n\\nNorm.\\n\\nHere we investigate norm growth of the updated matrix as a function of number of updates with ES and GRPO. We measure the Frobenius norm between model checkpoints within a training run. We do this for the Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model trained on the Countdown dataset.\\n\\n\\nThe results are shown in Figure\\u00a03. The Frobenius norm increases monotonically with the number of training iterations for ES-trained models. A similar trend is also present for GRPO-trained models (Figure A2); however, the key distinction lies in scale. After just 500 training iteration, the Frobenius norm of the ES-trained model relative to the base model is three orders of magnitude larger than the GRPO-trained model. When combined with what we learn from Figure 2, we see a clear association between the large increases in ES Frobenius norm and a decline in prior task accuracy. Thus, ES updates have significantly higher \\u21132\\\\ell_{2} norm difference, causing orders or magnitiude larger parameter-shifts compared to GRPO.\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 4: \\nLayerwise sparsity of parameter updates during fine-tuning (higher indicates more sparse updates).\\nES exhibits broadly distributed, dense updates across components, whereas GRPO updates are overall highly sparse across LLM parameter groups, consistent with more targeted parameter changes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSparsity.\\n\\nEach update in ES is constructed from high-variance, global perturbations applied across all parameters, which may affect a large number of stored parameters uniformly. In contrast, it is known that GRPO applies much sparser and targeted updates via backpropagation, limiting the extent of unintended parameter drift Mukherjee et al. (2025). To check the difference in the number of parameters affected by these algorithms, we evaluate the update sparsity in ES when compared to GRPO.\\n\\n\\nWe analyze Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct trained on the Countdown task with both GRPO and ES. We analyze the difference between a base model checkpoint and its corresponding fine-tuned checkpoint. For each shared parameter tensor, we compute the update \\u0394\\u200bW=Wn\\u200be\\u200bw\\u2212Wb\\u200ba\\u200bs\\u200be\\\\Delta W=W_{new}-W_{base}. Following prior work Mukherjee et al. (2025), we define sparsity as the percentage of elements whose absolute magnitude is below a fixed threshold (\\u03c4=10\\u22126\\\\tau=10^{-6}). Therefore, higher sparsity values mean a larger number of parameters are below this threshold, which means that the updates are more sparse. Parameters are grouped by architectural component, including attention projections (Q,K,V)(Q,K,V), the attention output projection (WO)(W_{O}), MLP layers and LayerNorms. Updates are further aggregated by transformer layer index to obtain layerwise sparsity profiles.\\n\\n\\nThe results are shown in Figure 4. We see that ES updates are substantially less sparse across layers and parameter groups when compared to GRPO. The sparsity levels for GRPO updates across all parameter types and layers are close to 95%, which means updates are concentrated around a very small number of parameters. However, the updates using ES have very low sparsity levels, showing that a much larger number of parameters are perturbed when fine-tuning with ES. The most sparse updates in ES appear for LayerNorm; however it also contains the least (and neglible) number of parameters compared to other parts of the model. Other layer updates, irrespective of model depth, are highly dense in ES-trained models.\\n\\n\\nTherefore, GRPO exhibits structured and comparatively sparse updates, aligning with the hypothesis that gradient-based optimization concentrates changes in task-relevant subspaces and mitigates interference with prior capabilities. When combined with KL regularization, these mechanisms provide a natural safeguard against large-scale parameter drift and, consequently, catastrophic forgetting.\\nIn contrast, we see that updates using ES have orders of magnitude larger norms and are much less sparse compared to GRPO. The lack of sparsity and large update norms in ES drifts the fine-tuned model further away from the base model, potentially leading to the catastrophic forgetting behavior observed in previous sections.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"4 Conclusion\": \"\\n\\n4 Conclusion\\n\\nWe perform an empirical analysis of Evolutionary Strategies for fine-tuning LLMs based on recent work Qiu et al. (2025) and show that it performs competetively with GRPO. Although, a critical roadblock still persists: we observe that ES exhibits significant catastrophic forgetting and progressively deteriorates performance on prior skills of the model. We show that this happens because ES updates have large norms and low sparsity levels (more dense), resulting in parameter drifts that are 1000x higher in magnitude than drifts observed with GRPO for the same number of update steps. These results imply that although recent progress in ES has bridged performance gap with state-of-the-art learning algorithms like GRPO, its intense model degradation still remains a challenge before its widespread adoption.\\n\\n\", \"Limitations\": \"\\nLimitations\\n\\nES has an inherent randomness associated with the updates due to the nature of the algorithm. As a result, models trained with ES exhibit high variance in stochastic perturbations. Although we observed consistent qualitative trends across the settings we tested, where we worked with a population size of 30 as suggested in prior work Qiu et al. (2025), increased population size will decrease the variance and increase statistical stability of our performance numbers.\\n\\n\\nAdditionally, we evaluate catastrophic forgetting by tracking performance on one task during continued fine-tuning on Countdown, which measures retention of a broad prior capability. Doing so does not fully capture multi-facetted loss of performance that may be happening in the model; however, is enough to give strong evidence of the occurence of the phenomenon.\\n\\n\", \"Appendix A Appendix\": \"\\n\\nAppendix A Appendix\\n\\n\\nA.1 Algorithmic Overview and Analogy Between ES and GRPO\\n\\n\\nA.1.1 ES Algorithm Overview\\n\\nQiu et al.

The following section describes why the population size in ES and number of rollouts in GRPO play an analogous role in controlling parameter updates.\\n\\n\\nFollowing the algorithm described by Qiu et al. (2025), an ES training update comprises of NN different seeds used to generate perturbations to the baseline model, resulting in NN different population members. Each population member is sampled with temperature at 0 to generate NN different responses, which are evaluated by a reward function to determine their fitness, which is converted into a z-score to weight the contribution of that respective perturbation to the baseline model. Further explanation can be found in A.1.\\n\\n\\nSimilarly, a GRPO training update samples NN candidate outputs from the current policy, evaluates them to obtain relative reward signals, and updates the policy via a policy-gradient objective while constraining deviation from a fixed reference policy through KL regularization (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025). Crucially, although ES simultaneously maintains multiple different versions of a model and GRPO maintains one, ES population size and GRPO number of rollouts both determine the number of samples used to estimate a stochastic update and to form a stochastic gradient or gradient-free estimator that drives the parameter update.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA.2 Implementation Details\\n\\nOur implementations for both GRPO and ES model training and analysis is attached to this submission.\\n\\n\\n\\nA.2.1 GRPO\\n\\nThe GRPO setup in this study is implemented on the VERL library, which employs the HybridFlow engine proposed by Sheng et al. (2025). Training was conducted on NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs and the Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) protocol was used to train across GPUs. Across all experiments, we maintained 30 rollouts for GRPO to mimic the 30 mutations generated by the original ES study by Qiu et al. (2025). To benchmark-finetuning, we used a batch-size of 200 examples along with a mini-batch size of 32 examples. A KL-Loss coefficient of \\u03b2=0.001\\\\beta=0.001 was used. The trainer was set to run for a total of 500 epochs, although once the validation accuracy appeared to plateau, we stopped training prematurely.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA.2.2 ES\\n\\nWe replicated the original author\\u2019s implementation of ES with two improvements: the authors found that using fp16 instead of bf16 improved validation accuracy on certain tasks. Additionally, the application of the Qwen chat template to the original task prompts improved validation accuracy on the experiment replica Countdown task for Qwen2.5-1.5B, but left model performance on all other regimes virtually the same. Runs were performed both with and without the chat template to assess the effect.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA.2.3 Reward functions\\n\\nFor the countdown task, we employ the same reward function used by Qiu et al. (2025), adapted to fit the VERL API. An answer reward is calculated, which assigns a reward of 1.01.0 if the model\\u2019s answer uses all numbers once and evaluates to the provided target, and 0.00.0 otherwise. A separate format score is calculated, which serves to ensure that the model\\u2019s response obeys an XML-style format with <think>...</think> thinking tokens first followed by response tokens <answer>...</answer>. We take a weighted average of the two rewards to calculate the final reward to assign to the model: Reward=0.1\\u22c5Format\\u200bReward+0.9\\u22c5Answer\\u200bReward\\\\mathrm{Reward}=0.1\\\\cdot\\\\mathrm{Format\\\\ Reward}+0.9\\\\cdot\\\\mathrm{Answer\\\\ Reward}\\n\\n\\nFor the GSM8K, MATH, and OlympiadBench benchmarks, we employ a rule-based reward function using a binary evaluation logic. An answer reward is calculated by extracting the model\\u2019s conclusion from the final 300 characters of the response using a regex pattern. The function first identifies the #### [number] format, falling back to \\\\boxed{...} tags if necessary, and assigns a reward of 1.01.0 if the extraction matches the ground truth and 0.00.0 otherwise.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA.3 Hyperparameter Values\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHyperparameter\\nValue\\n\\n\\nPopulation size\\n30\\n\\n\\nNoise scale \\u03c3\\\\sigma\\n\\n0.001\\n\\n\\nLearning rate \\u03b1\\\\alpha\\n\\n0.0005\\n\\n\\nMax tokens\\n1024\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 2: Hyperparameters used for Evolution Strategies (ES) fine-tuning.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA.4 Additional Experiments\\n\\n\\nA.4.1 Catastrophic Forgetting and KL\\n\\nFigure A1: \\nRelationship between KL divergence and task performance.\\nTop row: new-task accuracy (Countdown).\\nBottom row: prior-task accuracy (HellaSwag). Training step indicated per sample.\\nES exhibits increasing KL accompanied by degradation on the prior task, whereas GRPO maintains stable performance across a broader KL range.\\n\\n\\n\\nShenfeld et al. (2025) had previously established a negative correlation between KL-divergence and previous task score. We therefore searched whether this trend also is reflected within ES-trained models . We first looked at KL-divergence between the trained and base models A1 on the newly trained task. While ES-trained models increase in KL-divergence with subsequent training steps, this behavior was not consistent when trained with GRPO. This can be attributed to the explicit KL-regularization factor in GRPO, preventing continuous drifts from the base model.\\n\\n\\nThe trends for KL divergence and accuracy continue to diverge when evaluating previously known tasks A1. ES has a clear negative correlation between KL-divergence and old task performance. The KL-divergence between the new and base models also shows an increase over number of training iterations in ES. GRPO however continues to show no association between number of training steps and KL-divergence, as well as between KL-divergence and previous task accuracy. Therefore, KL-divergence is a less reliable indicator of catastrophic convergence across GRPO and ES.\\n\\n\\nFigure A2: \\nLog relationship between Frobenius norm of a model update and number of training iterations on a new task (Countdown).

Generative modeling is no exception. Generally, this class of models aims to estimate the underlying distribution of the data. Existing generative flavors encompass variational inference\\u00a0[18, 11, 33], generative adversarial networks\\u00a0[8] and score-based matching\\u00a0[37]. Despite mostly focusing on data modalities such as image\\u00a0[2] and text\\u00a0[24], there has been a recent surge of interest in generative models for tabular data. The interest lies in generating synthetic data to overcome challenges such as data scarcity, missing-value imputation, and individual privacy-preserving (see e.g.,\\u00a0[30] for a thorough review).\\n\\n\\nChallenges in tabular data generation\\n\\nModeling the joint distribution of tabular data has unique challenges. The main research interest in the generative model is on images, and, usually, the theory behind it assumes a continuous distribution of the data. This is not true for tabular data, which generally presents a mixture of both continuous and discrete variables. Moreover, continuous variables might exhibit several modes, and discrete variables may have a considerable number of categories, imposing additional challenges on the capability of a neural network to learn relationships between these two different types of data adequately.\\n\\n\\n\\nTokenization\\n\\nA data point of a tabular dataset is usually represented as a heterogeneous vector composed of numerical and discrete features. One possible solution to overcome this heterogeneity is to embed each feature into an embedding matrix via tokenization\\u00a0[9, 44]. In essence, this transformation linearly projects each feature into a continuous vector.\\n\\n\\n\\nTransformers\\n\\nThe Transformer architecture\\u00a0[39] was initially proposed for machine translation and later applied to text generation\\u00a0[31]. Given its unprecedented success, adaptations have been made to this architecture in the past few years for images\\u00a0[15], time series\\u00a0[41], and, naturally, tabular data\\u00a0[13, 36, 44]. In the tabular domain, the purpose of the Transformer architecture is to capture meaningful relations between feature representations of the data via attention mechanisms.\\n\\n\\n\\nMotivation\\n\\nTransformers are becoming a fundamental architectural block to model feature interactions in tabular data on different learning paradigms\\u00a0[36, 9, 44]. Typically, they operate on a \\u201craw\\u201d level of representation, i.e., at the data input level. In this work, we question its use to leverage abstract representations of a Neural Network, i.e., feature representations obtained by fully connected layers followed by nonlinearities. A prominent architecture for this study is the Variational Autoencoder (VAE), which encompasses three distinct kinds of representations: 1) an input representation that is fed into the recognition model (encoder); 2) a latent representation modeled via the statistics obtained by the recognition model; and 3) a reconstructed representation obtained by the generative model (decoder) (see Fig.\\u00a01). Fully Connected (FC) layers, which are affine maps, do not capture high-order dependencies between feature representations that may become important at deeper feature representations. The Transformer attention mechanism provides a suitable alternative to model these dependencies.\\n\\n\\n\\nOur Contribution\\n\\nThis work evaluates the impact of Transformers in a VAE for tabular data generation. We aim to answer the following question \\u2014 What\\u2019s the impact of integrating Transformers into different components of a VAE?\\nStarting with a VAE without Transformers, we study the effect of leveraging it over the aforementioned representations. In total, 6 variations are considered. This evaluation is performed by considering metrics that evaluate the statistical properties of the synthetic data with respect to the real data and through a Machine-Learning utility perspective. In addition, Center Kernel Alignment (CKA)\\u00a0[20] is used to compare similarities between feature representations on different components of the architectures. Our experiments are conducted using 57 datasets from the OpenML CC18 suite\\u00a0[3].\\n\\n\\nFrom an evaluation perspective, our study reveals a trade-off between fidelity and diversity of the synthetic data with respect to real data. Specifically, we observe that as Transformers are added into the architecture, synthetic data tends to be less faithful to real data, while its diversity increases, with the biggest gain obtained when leveraging the latent and output representations with Transformers. From a representational perspective, our findings reveal that the input and output of Transformers at both the encoder and decoder tend to present a high degree of similarity. Moreover, at the decoder, the Transformer appears to act as the identity function due to little or no effects in representational changes in residual connections. We observe that the reason for this effect is due to layer normalization, which shifts and scales the initial representation such that it offers no representational changes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work. Section 3 introduces the necessary formulations and provides an overview of the considered VAE models for the study. The experimental setup is outlined in Section 4, followed by an analysis of the experimental results in Section 5. Section 6 presents a detailed study on the similarities between feature representations at different levels of the architectures. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 7.\\n\\n\\n\", \"2 Related Work\": \"\\n\\n2 Related Work\\n\\nRecent advances in tabular data generation draw upon a variety of deep generative approaches. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) such as CTGAN [43] and its successors CTAB-GAN [45] and CTAB-GAN+ [46] adapt GAN-based frameworks to handle continuous and categorical features. Meanwhile, Diffusion Models [35, 11] have been specialized for tabular data through methods like TabDDPM [21], CoDi [22], StaSy [16], TabSyn [44], and TabDiff [34], each proposing distinct strategies to manage mixed data types and improve generative quality. Autoregressive models like GReaT\\u00a0[4] and TabMT\\u00a0[10] have also been considered in the tabular data generation framework. Flow-Matching [25] has led to novel gradient-boosting-based generative solutions [14]. Finally, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) [18] adaptations include TVAE\\u00a0[43], introduced alongside CTGAN, and VAEM\\u00a0[27], which consists of a two-stage training \\u2014 the first independently trains each feature using a VAE, while the second model\\u2019s the inter-variable dependencies using the latent variables learned from the first stage. Another variation, GOGGLE\\u00a0[26], was introduced as a generative model that approximates relational structure between variables via Graph Neural Networks, jointly training these relations with a VAE.\\n\\n\\nTransformers in Tabular Data Generation\\n\\nThe Transformer architecture has been explored as a means to capture feature relationships in tabular data generation. For example, TabDiff employs a Transformer both in the backbone and at the denoiser output, whereas TabSyn leverages Transformers to model the statistics of the recognition model and the generative distribution of a VAE. Nevertheless, a thorough examination of how Transformers affect data quality remains an open question. In this work, we attempt to fill this gap.\\n\\n\\n\", \"3 Formulation and Methods\": \"\\n\\n3 Formulation and Methods\\n\\nFigure 1: Left: Illustration of an embedding based VAE architecture.

In this work, we tackle this problem by representing each feature as a continuous vector via tokenization\\u00a0[9, 44].\\n\\n\\nFeature Tokenizer\\n\\nLet x be the input of a neural network. A feature tokenizer takes as input a data point and projects it into a (M\\u00d7d)(M\\\\times d)-dimensional space as:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nei(num)=xi(num)\\u200bwi(num)+bi(num)ei(cat)=xi(ohe)\\u200bWi(cat)+bi(cat),\\\\begin{split}\\\\textbf{e}_{i}^{(\\\\text{num})}&=x_{i}^{(\\\\text{num})}\\\\textbf{w}_{i}^{(\\\\text{num})}+\\\\textbf{b}_{i}^{(\\\\text{num})}\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\textbf{e}_{i}^{(\\\\text{cat})}&=\\\\textbf{x}_{i}^{(\\\\text{ohe})}\\\\textbf{W}_{i}^{(\\\\text{cat})}+\\\\textbf{b}_{i}^{(\\\\text{cat})}\\\\end{split}~~,\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere wi(num),bi(num),bi(cat)\\u2208\\u211d1\\u00d7d\\\\textbf{w}_{i}^{(\\\\text{num})},\\\\textbf{b}_{i}^{(\\\\text{num})},\\\\textbf{b}_{i}^{(\\\\text{cat})}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{1\\\\times d} and Wi(cat)\\u2208\\u211d|Cj|\\u00d7d\\\\textbf{W}_{i}^{(\\\\text{cat})}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{|C_{j}|\\\\times d}. In other words, each numerical feature is projected into a vector space where each sample shares the same weights, while for categorical features, this tokenization acts as a lookup table, i.e., each category has its own set of learnable weights. In the end, x is represented as the embedding matrix E\\u2208\\u211dM\\u00d7d\\\\textbf{E}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{M\\\\times d} by concatenating each ei\\\\textbf{e}_{i} along the feature dimension, E=\\u2a01i=1Mei\\\\textbf{E}=\\\\mathop{\\\\bigoplus}_{i=1}^{M}\\\\textbf{e}_{i}.\\n\\n\\n\\nFeature Detokenizer\\n\\nGiven a reconstructed embedding matrix E~\\u2208\\u211dM\\u00d7d\\\\tilde{\\\\textbf{E}}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{M\\\\times d}, the reconstructed representation x~\\\\tilde{\\\\textbf{x}} is obtained by projecting each embedding vector ei\\\\textbf{e}_{i} back to the feature space as\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nx~i(num)=e~i(num)\\u200bw~i(num)+b~i(num)x~i(ohe)=Softmax\\u200b(e~i(cat)\\u200bW~i(cat)+\\ud835\\udc83~i(cat)),\\\\begin{split}\\\\tilde{x}_{i}^{(\\\\text{num})}&=\\\\tilde{\\\\textbf{e}}_{i}^{(\\\\text{num})}\\\\tilde{\\\\textbf{w}}_{i}^{(\\\\text{num})}+\\\\tilde{b}_{i}^{(\\\\text{num})}\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\tilde{\\\\textbf{x}}_{i}^{(\\\\text{ohe})}&=\\\\text{Softmax}\\\\left(\\\\tilde{\\\\textbf{e}}_{i}^{(\\\\text{cat})}\\\\tilde{\\\\textbf{W}}_{i}^{(\\\\text{cat})}+\\\\tilde{\\\\boldsymbol{b}}_{i}^{(\\\\text{cat})}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{split}~~,\\n\\n(4)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwith b~i(num)\\u2208\\u211d1\\u00d71\\\\tilde{b}_{i}^{(\\\\text{num})}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{1\\\\times 1}, w~i(num)\\u2208\\u211dd\\u00d71,\\ud835\\udc83~i(cat)\\u2208\\u211d1\\u00d7|Cj|\\\\tilde{\\\\textbf{w}}_{i}^{(\\\\text{num})}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d\\\\times 1},~\\\\tilde{\\\\boldsymbol{b}}_{i}^{(\\\\text{cat})}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{1\\\\times|C_{j}|} and W~i(cat)\\u2208\\u211dd\\u00d7|Cj|\\\\tilde{\\\\textbf{W}}_{i}^{(\\\\text{cat})}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d\\\\times|C_{j}|}.\\nIn the end, we concatenate every reconstructed feature\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nx~=(x~1(num),\\u2026,x~Mn(num),x~1(ohe),\\u2026,x~Mc(ohe)).\\\\tilde{\\\\textbf{x}}=\\\\left(\\\\tilde{x}_{1}^{(\\\\text{num})},...,\\\\tilde{x}_{M_{n}}^{(\\\\text{num})},\\\\tilde{\\\\textbf{x}}_{1}^{(\\\\text{ohe})},...,\\\\tilde{\\\\textbf{x}}_{M_{c}}^{(\\\\text{ohe})}\\\\right)~~.\\n\\n(5)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2 Self-Attention\\n\\nThe main component of the Transformer architecture (cf. right image of Fig.\\u00a01) is the attention mechanism. In the context of tabular data, its purpose is to capture relationships between variables in the embedding space. In our work, this is accomplished via dot-product attention. These interactions go through a Softmax non-linearity to normalize the contribution of all features with respect to a given one.

An initial implementation that leverages embeddings at the input and output, but without Transformers, is considered, and we call it VAE. The following models consider Transformers acting at the backbone of the encoder, the latent space, and the decoder head. The different parts of the network where these Transformers are included are explicitly shown in the middle image of Fig.\\u00a01. We detail a forward pass of the architecture that leverages Transformers over all the considered (ELD-VAE) in the Supplemental Material. The remainder of the architectures share the same encoder and decoder components, except where the Transformer acts. For a review of the theory behind Variational Autoencoders, we recommend the readers to\\u00a0[19].\\n\\n\\nTable 1: Architectures under study in this work.\\n\\n\\n\\nModel (Abbreviation)\\nTransformer on:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnc(oder)\\nLat(ent)\\nDec(oder)\\n\\n\\nVAE (VAE)\\n\\u2717\\n\\u2717\\n\\u2717\\n\\n\\nEnc-VAE (E-VAE)\\n\\u2713\\n\\u2717\\n\\u2717\\n\\n\\nEnc-Lat-VAE (EL-VAE)\\n\\u2713\\n\\u2713\\n\\u2717\\n\\n\\nEnc-Lat-Dec-VAE (ELD-VAE)\\n\\u2713\\n\\u2713\\n\\u2713\\n\\n\\nLat-Dec-VAE (LD-VAE)\\n\\u2717\\n\\u2713\\n\\u2713\\n\\n\\nDec-VAE (D-VAE)\\n\\u2717\\n\\u2717\\n\\u2713\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"4 Experimental Setup\": \"\\n\\n4 Experimental Setup\\n\\n\\n4.1 Datasets\\n\\nWe use the OpenML CC18 suite\\u00a0[3] as a benchmark to evaluate the methods presented in this paper. It is composed of 72 datasets used for classification tasks. From this benchmark, we select 57 datasets that encompass samples and feature dimensions in the range between N\\u2208[500,96320]N\\\\in[500,96320] and M\\u2208[4,240]M\\\\in[4,240], respectively. For all datasets, the train and test splits provided by the OpenML CC18 suite are used, and finally, we extract 15% of the training set, which serves as our validation set. We observed training instabilities in three of the considered datasets, which we detail in the Supplemental Material.\\n\\n\\nFor all datasets, the following pre-processing is applied: 1) we begin by dropping features that only contain missing values, and numerical or categorical features with 0 variance or only one category, respectively; 2) numerical and categorical columns with missing values are replaced with the mean and mode, respectively; 3) numerical variables are encoded using a quantile Transformer with a Gaussian distribution\\u00a0111https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.QuantileTransformer.html based on previous works\\u00a0[44, 34], while categorical variables are encoded using one-hot encoding.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.2 Training and Sampling Details\\n\\nEach model is trained under 500 epochs with the Adam optimizer [17], using a weight decay of 0.90.9 and a learning rate of 1\\u00d710\\u221231\\\\times 10^{-3}. The batch size is determined by following simple rules, given the validation set. The tokenizer, detokenizer, hidden, and latent layers weights are initialized with the same values for all models, and if two architectures share the same Transformer location, so the Transformer.\\n\\n\\nRegarding model hyperparameters, we keep them constant over all datasets and models. Each Transformer is defined with one head, four blocks\\u00a0222In the Supplemental Material, we study the effect of lowering the number of blocks in terms of high-density estimation metrics., a hidden dimension of 128, and without dropout. By recommendation\\u00a0[9], we also use its pre-norm variation\\u00a0[40]. An embedding dimension of d=4d=4 is considered following previous works\\u00a0[44]. The fully connected layers of the encoder and decoder have a hidden dimension of H=128H=128, while the latent dimension is L=64L=64, unless stated otherwise.\\n\\n\\nAfter training, we sample over the latent as z\\u223c\\ud835\\udca9\\u200b(\\ud835\\udfce,I)\\\\textbf{z}\\\\sim\\\\mathcal{N}(\\\\boldsymbol{0},\\\\textbf{I}). In our experiments, the number of synthetic samples is the same size as the training data.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3 Evaluation Metrics\\n\\nThe synthetic data produced by the generative models under study are evaluated using several metrics found in the literature. We divide the considered metrics into three groups: 1)\\u00a0Low-Density Estimation, where 1-way marginals and pairwise-correlations measurements are considered to estimate differences between feature distributions; 2)\\u00a0High-Density Estimation, which compares the joint probability distributions of synthetic and real data; 3)\\u00a0Machine Learning-Efficiency, aiming to determine the usefulness of synthetic data in downstream tasks such as classification.\\n\\n\\nNote that all metrics are defined on a domain between [0, 1], where the higher the value, the better the model performance is.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3.1 Low-Density Estimation\\n\\nUnder this class of metrics, we consider 1-way marginals and pairwise correlations.\\n\\n\\n1-Way Marginals\\n\\nThe first metric measures how similar the (independent) feature distributions between real and synthetic data are. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic\\u00a0[12] is computed for numerical columns, under the null hypothesis that real and synthetic data are drawn from the same probability distribution, while the Total Variation Distance\\u00a0[23] is applied for categorical ones. In the end, we average the similarities obtained from each feature.\\n\\n\\n\\nPairwise-Correlations\\n\\nPairwise-correlations measure the dependency between two features in a dataset. Given two columns (m1,m2)(m_{1},m_{2}) of both (x,x~)(\\\\textbf{x},\\\\tilde{\\\\textbf{x}}), if they are both numerical, we determine Pearson\\u2019s Correlation\\u00a0[28]; if they are both categorical, the Contingency Similarity; finally if they are of different types, the numerical column is partitioned into bins, and afterwards, the Contingency Similarity is applied. The score between the correlations (\\u03c1,\\u03c1~)(\\\\rho,\\\\tilde{\\\\rho}) obtained for each type of data is then determined as\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ns\\u200bc\\u200bo\\u200br\\u200be=1\\u2212|\\u03c1m1,m2\\u2212\\u03c1~m1,m2|2.score=1-\\\\frac{|\\\\rho_{m_{1},m_{2}}-\\\\tilde{\\\\rho}_{m_{1},m_{2}}|}{2}~~.\\n\\n(7)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFinally, we average all the scores obtained for each pairwise correlation. For these two first metrics, we use the implementations provided by the sdmetrics\\u00a0[38] Python package. In our experiments, we dub these metrics as low-density, as they only capture unidimensional statistics and pairwise relationships between variables.\\n\\n\\nTable 2: Average results obtained for the studied models.

We use the work from\\u00a0[1], which introduces the notion of \\u03b1\\\\alpha-Precision and \\u03b2\\\\beta-Recall. Generally speaking, \\u03b1\\\\alpha-Precision and \\u03b2\\\\beta-Recall characterize the fidelity and diversity of the generated data to the real one, respectively. While \\u03b1\\\\alpha-Precision is computed by determining the probability that a generated sample resides in the support of the real-data distribution, \\u03b2\\\\beta-Recall is computed by determining the probability that a real sample resides in the support of the synthetic data distribution. A synthetic data point x~n\\\\tilde{x}_{n} is said to reside inside the \\u03b1\\\\alpha-support of the real distribution if\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nf\\u03b1\\u200b(x~n)=\\ud835\\udfcf\\u200b{x~n\\u2208B\\u200b(cr,r\\u03b1)},f_{\\\\alpha}(\\\\tilde{x}_{n})=\\\\boldsymbol{1}\\\\{\\\\tilde{x}_{n}\\\\in\\\\textbf{B}(c_{r},r_{\\\\alpha})\\\\}~~,\\n\\n(8)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere B\\u200b(cr,r\\u03b1)\\\\textbf{B}(c_{r},r_{\\\\alpha}) is a non-parametric estimator of the support of real data, assumed to be a ball of radius r\\u03b1=Q\\u03b1{||xn\\u2212cr||:1\\u2264n\\u2264N}r_{\\\\alpha}=Q_{\\\\alpha}\\\\{||x_{n}-c_{r}||:1\\\\leq n\\\\leq N\\\\} and center cr=\\u2211i=1Mxic_{r}=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{M}x_{i}. Q\\u03b1Q_{\\\\alpha} is the \\u03b1\\\\alpha-quantile function. On the other hand, a real data point xnx_{n} is said to reside inside the \\u03b2\\\\beta-support of the synthetic distribution if\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nf\\u03b2\\u200b(xn)=\\ud835\\udfcf\\u200b{x~n\\u2217\\u03b2\\u2208B\\u200b(xn,NNDk\\u200b(xn))},f_{\\\\beta}(x_{n})=\\\\boldsymbol{1}\\\\{\\\\tilde{x}_{n^{*}}^{\\\\beta}\\\\in\\\\textbf{B}(x_{n},\\\\text{NND}_{k}(x_{n}))\\\\}~~,\\n\\n(9)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere x~n\\u2217\\u03b2\\\\tilde{x}_{n^{*}}^{\\\\beta} is the synthetic sample in the ball closest to xnx_{n}, and NNDk\\u200b(xn)\\\\text{NND}_{k}(x_{n}) the kk-nearest neighbor in \\ud835\\udc9f\\\\mathcal{D}. After averaging f\\u03b1\\u200b(x~n)f_{\\\\alpha}(\\\\tilde{x}_{n}) and f\\u03b2\\u200b(xn)f_{\\\\beta}(x_{n}) for all data points, these quantities are integrated over all (\\u03b1,\\u03b2\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)-quantiles. We use the implementation of these metrics provided by the synthcity package\\u00a0[29].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3.3 Machine Learning-Efficiency\\n\\nRegarding Machine Learning-Efficiency (ML-Efficiency), we are interested in both Utility and ML-Fidelity. The classifier taken into consideration is XGBoost\\u00a0[6]. Hyperparameters are kept constant, with a number of 500 boosters and a learning rate of 1\\u00d710\\u221221\\\\times 10^{-2}. After training a model, a real test set is evaluated using two models \\u2014 one trained over real data, \\u2133real\\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\text{real}}, and another trained over synthetic data, \\u2133syn\\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\text{syn}}. We denote predictions obtained from \\u2133real\\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\text{real}} and \\u2133syn\\\\mathcal{M}_{\\\\text{syn}} as y^(real)\\\\hat{y}^{(\\\\text{real})}, y^(syn)\\\\hat{y}^{(\\\\text{syn})}, respectively.\\n\\n\\nUtility\\n\\nBy utility, we ask how well a model performs when trained over a synthetic dataset \\ud835\\udc9fsyn\\\\mathcal{D}_{\\\\text{syn}} and evaluated under a holdout set from the real dataset x(test)\\\\textbf{x}^{(\\\\text{test})}. We adopt the Train on Synthetic, Test on Real (TSTR) (e.g.\\u00a0[7]) methodology.

We begin by reporting results based on average results and ranks in Section\\u00a05.1. In Section\\u00a05.2, the observed trade-off between fidelity and diversity is detailed.\\n\\n\\n\\n5.1 General overview\\n\\nWe begin by reporting top performers based on average score and ranking for each metric based on the results presented in Table\\u00a02. Models with the highest average score are highlighted in bold, while those with the highest average rank are underlined. In addition, for given metrics, models with double asterisks (\\u2217\\u2217) imply that their results are statistically significant to the top performer using the Wilcoxon\\u2019s Signed Rank Test\\u00a0[42].\\n\\n\\nOverall, LD-VAE consistently excels across the considered metrics, attaining the highest average score except for \\u03b1\\\\alpha-Precision, where the E-VAE outperforms it. Although LD-VAE achieves the best mean scores on most metrics, its performance on low-density estimation and ML-Efficiency metrics does not present statistically significant differences compared to other variations. However, for high-density metrics, LD-VAE results on \\u03b2\\\\beta-Recall are statistically superior to those of all other models except ELD-VAE. In contrast, for \\u03b1\\\\alpha-Precision, the E-VAE achieves statistically significant results compared to models that leverage Transformers in the decoder (D-VAE, LD-VAE, ELD-VAE).\\n\\n\\nRanking-wise, there is no single clear winner. In low-density estimation metrics, despite LD-VAE having the highest score, the baseline VAE attains the best rank for 1-way marginals. Meanwhile, LD-VAE claims the top rank for Pairwise-Correlations. In high-density metrics, both top performers share the lowest rank; notably, the baseline VAE ties with the encoder-only variant on \\u03b1\\\\alpha-Precision. Regarding ML-Efficiency, ELD-VAE holds the best rank in Utility, while competing with LD-VAE in terms of ML-Fidelity.\\n\\n\\nIn sum, incorporating Transformers into different architecture components generally yields no substantial improvements for feature distribution modeling or machine-learning utility. The most notable effect appears in the high-density estimation metrics, where the baseline VAE and E-VAE synthesize data with higher fidelity, while models leveraging Transformers in the latent and decoder spaces produce more diverse samples. Section 5.2 delves deeper into this fidelity\\u2013diversity trade-off, and corresponding analyses for low-density estimation and ML-Efficiency are provided in the Supplemental Material.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.2 Fidelity-Diversity trade-off\\n\\nWe analyze changes in performance as Transformers are added to the network. Two sequences of models are considered to draw conclusions \\u2014 one that begins by appending a Transformer into the encoder, then to the latent space, and finally to the decoder. We dub this sequence Forward, which follows VAE \\u2192\\\\to E-VAE \\u2192\\\\to EL-VAE \\u2192\\\\to ELD-VAE; the second sequence begins by adding a Transformer to the decoder, then to the latent space, and finally to the encoder. We call this sequence Backward and follows VAE \\u2192\\\\to D-VAE \\u2192\\\\to LD-VAE \\u2192\\\\to ELD-VAE. Note that the models considered at the beginning and end of the sequences are the same. We continue to use Table\\u00a02, supported by Fig.\\u00a02, depicting differences in performance as Transformers are added to the network as a function of dataset size buckets, by considering buckets from small to large with the following intervals: small \\u2208\\\\in [500, 1000), medium \\u2208\\\\in [1000, 5000) and large \\u2208\\\\in [5000, 96230].\\n\\n\\nForward Sequence\\n\\nTable\\u00a02 reveals that, with the exception of E-VAE, adding Transformers into various components of the architecture generally results in synthetic data that is less faithful to real data. In the transition from E-VAE \\u2192\\\\to EL-VAE, it becomes clear that as the dataset size increases, the faithfulness of the synthetic data decreases (cf. top-right plot of Fig.\\u00a02) by considering a Transformer to leverage the latent representation of the architecture. Conversely, when transitioning from EL-VAE to ELD-VAE, the trend reverses: while EL-VAE faithfulness diminishes, particularly in larger datasets, its performance remains superior for small to mid-size datasets until ELD-VAE eventually overtakes it on larger ones.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: Aggregated gains in performance as Transformers are added to the studied components for \\u03b1\\\\alpha-Precision (top-plots) and \\u03b2\\\\beta-Recall (bottom-plots), for the Forward (left-plots) and Backward (right-plots) sequences.\\n\\n\\nRegarding \\u03b2\\\\beta-Recall, E-VAE performance remains approximately on par with that of the base VAE for all dataset buckets. On the other hand, an average gain of 4.7%4.7\\\\% is obtained when considering a Transformer over the latent space. In addition, we observe a consistent increase in diversity as the data bucket size increases. An additional benefit of 2.7% is achieved for applying a Transformer in the decoder (EL-VAE \\u2192\\\\to ELD-VAE). The bottom-left plot of Fig.\\u00a02 further indicates that these gains are more significant on small-size datasets while remaining approximately the same for medium and large dataset buckets.\\n\\n\\n\\nBackward Sequence\\n\\nIn the backward sequence, a considerable drop in performance of 6.7% in \\u03b1\\\\alpha-Precision is observed by considering a Transformer to leverage the reconstructed representation of the data (D-VAE). As shown in the top-right plot of Fig.\\u00a02, this decrease is consistent across all dataset sizes except for the larger ones, where a 2% improvement emerges. A gain in fidelity of 6% and 3.1% is observed for small and mid-size datasets when leveraging a Transformer over the latent space, while a significant loss of 4.8% is observed for large-size datasets. The transition from LD-VAE to ELD-VAE tells us that, for small datasets, leveraging the input representation with a Transformer deteriorates the faithfulness of the synthetic data, while for larger datasets, there is little to no gain. To conclude, in terms of \\u03b2\\\\beta-Recall, notable gains are observed from leveraging Transformers over the decoder (VAE \\u2192\\\\to D-VAE) and latent space (D-VAE \\u2192\\\\to LD-VAE).\\n\\n\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nThe evaluation presented in the previous section indicates a trade-off between high-density estimation metrics. In general, adding Transformers into a VAE posits a lower fidelity of the synthetic data w.r.t. the real one but a higher diversification. Comparing the base implementation of a VAE with the Transformed-based architectures, this trade-off is observed for all models except for E-VAE, which leverages the initial representation of the data at a lower level of abstraction (i.e., at the input level). We argue that E-VAE does not provide significant differences to its base implementation in terms of high-density estimation metrics since, after the model is trained, the encoder is \\u201cdetached\\\" from the model, and only the generator (decoder) is used to synthesize samples. In the Supplemental Material, an additional discussion of this trade-off is considered by evaluating the reconstructed data obtained by a forward pass on the test set.\\n\\n\\nAs deeper representations of the network are considered, self-attention has more flexibility in modeling feature interactions, as these representations are less constrained by the original representation of the data. From an evaluation perspective, we\\u2019ve shown in the previous section that this additional flexibility tends to produce more diverse and less faithful data. It is known that VAE produces less faithful (blurry) data\\u00a0[32] in the image modality due to the regularization term in the loss function that tries to approximate the distribution of the recognition model with the Gaussian prior.\\nHere, we observe that considering Transformers to leverage latent and reconstructed representations further impacts this faithfulness, albeit observing a considerable gain in diversity.\\n\\n\\nFrom a Machine-Learning standpoint, Table 2 shows that placing Transformers at various points in the network does not yield statistically significant gains. This outcome likely arises from spurious correlations introduced between the independent and dependent features, which, despite increasing diversity, do not translate into better decision-boundary estimation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"6 Representations Similarities\": \"\\n\\n6 Representations Similarities\\n\\nFigure 3: Aggregated similarities for the considered models for each data bucket.

The (linear) CKA similarity is defined as\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCKA=\\u2016E2T\\u200bE1\\u2016F2\\u2016E1T\\u200bE1\\u2016F\\u200b\\u2016E2T\\u200bE2\\u2016F,\\\\text{CKA}=\\\\frac{||\\\\textbf{E}_{2}^{T}\\\\textbf{E}_{1}||_{F}^{2}}{||\\\\textbf{E}_{1}^{T}\\\\textbf{E}_{1}||_{F}||\\\\textbf{E}_{2}^{T}\\\\textbf{E}_{2}||_{F}}~~,\\n\\n(11)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere ||.||F||.||_{F} denotes the Frobenius norm. This measure is bounded between [0,1], where 1 denotes that the considered representations are similar.\\n\\n\\nFigure 4: Similarities between block representations of a Transformer for the churn, adult and credit-approval datasets. Each cell of the heatmap denotes the similarity between two feature representations. Higher similarities have a lighter color. Depending on where a Transformer acts, we follow the naming convention T(Enc, Lat, Dec) to denote a given Transformer, while (in, out, block.i) to denote input, output, and internal block layer representations.\\n\\n\\nWe begin by considering similarities between the input and output representations of Transformers that are leveraged on the studied representations (cf. the Transformer architecture in Fig.\\u00a01). Note that these representations are a tensor \\ud835\\udc04\\u2208\\u211db\\u00d7F\\u00d7d\\\\mathbf{E}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{b\\\\times F\\\\times d}. In the following study, we flatten these representations into a matrix of shape \\ud835\\udc04\\u2208\\u211db\\u00d7F\\u200bd\\\\mathbf{E}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{b\\\\times Fd}. The CKA similarity is always evaluated over data points of the test set of a given dataset in a fully trained model.\\n\\n\\nAggregated Similarities\\n\\nWe begin by observing a high average similarity between representations before and after the encoder and decoder Transformers on all the considered networks, independently of the considered data bucket (cf. Fig.\\u00a03), hinting that, after a model is trained, and on average, little to no variation in the direction of these representations w.r.t. to its input are observed. Conversely, we observe a lower averaged similarity measure at the latent Transformer, likely due to the stochastic effects introduced by the reparameterization trick.\\n\\n\\nFigure 5: Heatmap similarities between representations on the considered Transformers for the ELD-VAE model, for the adult dataset. Each cell denotes the similarity between two feature representations inside a Transformer. The higher the similarity, the lighter the color of the cell. The Transformer on the left details the representations we extract to measure similarities presented in the heatmaps.\\n\\n\\n\\nInternal Similarities\\n\\nFollowing, we investigate the similarities between the input and output of each Transformer block of ELD-VAE on three different datasets. These similarities are presented in Fig.\\u00a04. We observe high similarities between consecutive Transformer block representations in each component. Notably, representations over the Transformer that act at the decoder present high similarity regardless of their depth, indicating little to no variation in the representation before and after its application, as previously discussed. Regarding Transformers that act at the input and latent representations, we observe a higher dissimilarity between the input and output representations, especially at the latent space, indicating representational changes in this region. We questioned whether this effect is due to possible over-parameterization of the network by considering different numbers of Transformer blocks in the considered components. We observed that even when one block is considered, a high similarity between representations is obtained. We explore this in more detail in the Supplemental Material.\\n\\n\\nAlso, representations between different Transformer components (e.g., from Latent to Decoder) tend to be highly dissimilar, possibly due to leveraging these representations by the following pointwise non-linearities operating in both the encoder and decoder.\\n\\n\\nWe further analyze how the internal representation similarities evolve within each Transformer block of the ELD-VAE architecture when applied to the adult dataset. Fig.\\u00a05 illustrates these changes, complemented with a Transformer block depicting the representations that are compared. It is noteworthy that although operations like layer normalization (e.n1) and self-attention (e.attn) initially exhibit lower similarity compared to the original representation (e.in), a significant increase in similarity is observed after applying the residual connection (e.res). While at the Transformers placed in the encoder and latent components, this effect is observed with a higher similarity inside each block; in the decoder, we observe this consecutively after each residual connection, across all blocks.\\n\\n\\nRecalling that the residual connection is the addition between the initial representation and the self-attention output, this suggests that the combination of layer normalization and self-attention does not alter the direction of the original representation. Instead, these components appear to function primarily as a scaling factor for the initial representation within each block. To validate this observation, we consider the residual connection expressed by E^=E+f\\u200b(E)\\\\hat{\\\\textbf{E}}=\\\\textbf{E}+f(\\\\textbf{E}), where E^\\\\hat{\\\\textbf{E}} corresponds to e.res, f\\u200b(E)f(\\\\textbf{E}) to e.attn, and E to e.in. If this residual connection merely scales the initial representation, then E^=\\u03c3\\u200bE\\\\hat{\\\\textbf{E}}=\\\\sigma\\\\textbf{E}. Analyzing this on a per-data-point basis, solving for \\u03c3\\\\sigma gives \\u03c3=E^\\u22c5EE\\u22c5E\\\\sigma=\\\\frac{\\\\hat{\\\\textbf{E}}\\\\cdot\\\\textbf{E}}{\\\\textbf{E}\\\\cdot\\\\textbf{E}}.\\n\\n\\nThe box-plots of Fig.\\u00a06 display the variation of \\u03c3\\\\sigma over the test set and across different blocks for ELD-VAE. At the decoder, the values of \\u03c3\\\\sigma are close to 1, indicating that the representations remain almost unchanged across the blocks. This suggests that once the model is trained, the Transformer at the decoder acts like an identity function. In the encoder, while the overall variability in representations is also low, different blocks yield distinct values of \\u03c3\\\\sigma. On the other hand, the latent representations exhibit a higher degree of variability in \\u03c3\\\\sigma, particularly noticeable in the first layer. To conclude this analysis, the bar-plots of Fig.\\u00a06 show that the norm of the representation after layer normalization is lower than that of the original representation, in particular at the decoder, indicating that this layer shifts and scales the initial representation s.t. it leads to negligible representation changes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 6: Top: \\u03c3\\\\sigma variation. Bottom: Norms of each representation inside each Transformer block. Both quantities are evaluated on the test set of adult dataset in the ELD-VAE architecture.\\n\\n\\n\", \"7 Conclusions\": \"\\n\\n7 Conclusions\\n\\nIn this study, we explored the effects of applying a Transformer to the input, latent, and reconstructed representations of a VAE. Our key takeaway is a trade-off between fidelity and diversity: while using Transformers on latent and reconstructed representations increases the variability of generated data, it also reduces its fidelity. Moreover, this heightened diversity does not bring noteworthy improvements in downstream Machine-Learning tasks, raising questions about the necessity of including Transformers, given their additional computational complexity.\\n\\n\\nWe further investigated the learned representations once these models were trained. A prominent observation is that the reconstructed representation processed by the Transformer essentially converges to the identity function. This behavior appears tied to residual connections, specifically because layer normalization rescales the input representation.\\n\\n\\nFuture research involves examining how incorporating Transformers affects the quality of synthetic data across other generative models. A parallel priority is tailoring Transformer architectures specifically for tabular data, which presents unique challenges compared to text-based domains. Finally, given the prominent re-scaling of layer normalization, a possible direction is to study the effect of removing this component of the Transformer architecture.\\n\\n\\n{ack}\\nThis work was partially funded by projects AISym4Med (101095387) supported by Horizon Europe Cluster 1: Health, ConnectedHealth (n.o 46858), supported by Competitiveness and Internationalisation Operational Programme (POCI) and Lisbon Regional Operational Programme (LISBOA 2020), under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement, through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and Center for Responsible AI, nr.

Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) addresses this challenge by enabling learning systems to continuously learn new classes while preserving prior knowledge. With the rise of pre-trained models (PTMs) such as CLIP, leveraging their strong generalization and semantic alignment capabilities has become a promising direction in CIL. However, existing CLIP-based CIL methods are often scattered across disparate codebases, rely on inconsistent configurations, hindering fair comparisons, reproducibility, and practical adoption. Therefore, we propose C3Box (CLIP-based Class-inCremental learning toolBOX), a modular and comprehensive Python toolbox. C3Box integrates representative traditional CIL methods, ViT-based CIL methods, and state-of-the-art CLIP-based CIL methods into a unified CLIP-based framework. By inheriting the streamlined design of PyCIL, C3Box provides a JSON-based configuration and standardized execution pipeline. This design enables reproducible experimentation with low engineering overhead and makes C3Box a reliable benchmark platform for continual learning research. Designed to be user-friendly, C3Box relies only on widely used open-source libraries and supports major operating systems.

However, real-world scenarios are inherently dynamic, with data typically emerging as continuous and evolving data streams\\u00a0(Gomes et al., 2017). Traditional deep learning methods are typically optimized for static data distributions and struggle to integrate new classes over time. When learning from dynamic data streams, these methods often overwrite previous knowledge to accommodate new classes, resulting in catastrophic forgetting\\u00a0(French, 1999). Class-Incremental Learning (CIL)\\u00a0(Rebuffi et al., 2017) has been proposed to address this issue\\u00a0(Zhou et al., 2024d). Driven by the remarkable success of Pre-trained Models (PTMs), such as Vision Transformers\\u00a0(Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) and CLIP\\u00a0(Radford et al., 2021), the focus of CIL research has undergone a significant shift. The field is moving away from traditional training from scratch with randomly initialized weights toward leveraging the inherent generalization capabilities of PTMs\\u00a0(Zhou et al., 2024b).\\n\\n\\nIn particular, CLIP\\u00a0(Radford et al., 2021) has emerged as a pioneering pre-trained vision-language model\\u00a0(Wang et al., 2024) that provides a powerful starting point for continual learning by aligning visual concepts with natural language in a shared embedding space. Unlike traditional vision-only models, CLIP leverages rich textual semantics to guide the learning process, offering a more robust representation that effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting while adapting to dynamic real-world scenarios\\u00a0(Hu et al., 2025; Wen et al., 2025). Despite these advantages, current CLIP-based CIL research still faces substantial practical challenges. Firstly, the implementation of various CLIP-based CIL methods is highly fragmented, with researchers often relying on disparate codebases and inconsistent experimental protocols. This lack of a unified framework makes it difficult to reproduce results and build upon previous work. Secondly, the absence of a standardized experimental protocol leads to significant evaluation inconsistency, where the use of varying data splits and evaluation metrics prevents fair comparisons. Thirdly, integrating CLIP-based methods into diverse incremental learning scenarios remains cumbersome, as different adaptation strategies often require bespoke modules and interface engineering, which imposes a significant engineering burden on researchers.\\n\\n\\nFigure 1:  Overview of C3Box and its main functionalities and modules.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo bridge these gaps and provide a standardized platform for the machine learning community, we present C3Box (CLIP-based Class-inCremental\\nlearning toolBOX), a modular and comprehensive toolbox specifically tailored.\\nAs shown in Figure\\u00a01, C3Box provides extensive algorithm coverage by integrating state-of-the-art CLIP-based CIL methods alongside representative traditional and ViT-based CIL approaches, as well as fundamental baselines, within a unified framework that enables systematic and fair baseline comparisons. Moreover, building on the streamlined architecture of PyCIL\\u00a0(Zhou et al., 2023a) and PILOT\\u00a0(Sun et al., 2025), C3Box provides a unified configuration and execution pipeline, allowing users to define datasets, backbones, and training settings in a single JSON file. This design offers a standardized interface that allows for seamless integration of new methods and automated logging, ensuring high reproducibility and minimal engineering overhead. As a user-friendly toolbox, C3Box adopts consistent unified interfaces across methods and relies only on widely used open-source libraries to ensure easy adoption and broad compatibility across major operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and Windows.\\n\\n\", \"2 Toolbox Usage\": \"\\n\\n2 Toolbox Usage\\n\\nDependencies: Building upon the established architectures of PyCIL\\u00a0(Zhou et al., 2023a) and PILOT\\u00a0(Sun et al., 2025), C3Box is built on a robust, modular software stack. It relies solely on a suite of widely adopted open-source libraries, such as NumPy\\u00a0(Harris et al., 2020) and SciPy\\u00a0(Virtanen et al., 2020) for fundamental numerical operations and optimization, while the core neural architectures are implemented using the PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019) framework. We also utilize the OpenCLIP library (Cherti et al., 2023) to provide a standardized interface for loading diverse pre-trained model weights.\\nThe tqdm\\u00a0(da Costa-Luis, 2019) library provides real-time progress monitoring.\\n\\n\\nSupported datasets: To thoroughly support the evaluation of various algorithms, we follow\\u00a0(Zhou et al., 2025c) and select ten benchmark datasets with significant domain gaps from CLIP\\u2019s pre-training dataset. The specific evaluation benchmarks include: CIFAR100 (Krizhevsky, 2009), CUB200 (Wah et al., 2011), ObjectNet (Barbu et al., 2019), ImageNet-R (Hendrycks et al., 2021), FGVCAircraft (Maji et al., 2013), StanfordCars (Krause et al., 2013), Food101 (Bossard et al., 2014), SUN397 (Xiao et al., 2010), UCF101 (Soomro et al., 2012) and TV100\\u00a0(Zhou et al., 2024a). Following the benchmark protocols in CIL\\u00a0(Zhou et al., 2025c), we evaluate on 100 classes for CIFAR100, Aircraft, Cars, Food, UCF and TV100; 200 classes for CUB200, ObjectNet, and ImageNet-R; and 300 classes for SUN to maintain consistency across incremental stages.\\n\\nDataset split: Following the evaluation protocols in CIL\\u00a0(Zhou et al., 2024d), we utilize \\u2018B-mm Inc-nn\\u2019 to split the classes. Specifically, mm denotes the number of classes in the initial stage, while nn represents the number of classes in each subsequent incremental stage.\\n\\nImplemented Methods:\\nC3Box implements a total of 17 representative CIL methods, covering traditional CIL methods, i.e., FOSTER\\u00a0(Wang et al., 2022a), MEMO\\u00a0(Zhou et al., 2023b), ViT-based CIL methods, i.e., L2P\\u00a0(Wang et al., 2022c), DualPrompt\\u00a0(Wang et al., 2022b), CODA-Prompt\\u00a0(Smith et al., 2023), EASE\\u00a0(Zhou et al., 2024c), SimpleCIL\\u00a0(Zhou et al., 2025a), APER (with Adapter/Finetune/SSF/VPT variants)\\u00a0(Zhou et al., 2025a), TUNA\\u00a0(Wang et al., 2025), and state-of-the-art CLIP-based methods, including RAPF\\u00a0(Huang et al., 2024),\\nCLG-CBM\\u00a0(Yu et al., 2025), MG-CLIP\\u00a0(Huang et al., 2025), PROOF\\u00a0(Zhou et al., 2025c), ENGINE\\u00a0(Zhou et al., 2025b), and BOFA\\u00a0(Li et al., 2026). In addition, C3Box provides common baselines such as Finetune and ZS-CLIP\\u00a0(Radford et al., 2021). Notably, all methods have been adapted into a unified CLIP-based framework. Implementation details are provided in Appendix\\u00a0A.\\n\\n\\nEvaluation metric: Following the evaluation protocols in CIL\\u00a0(Rebuffi et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2025c), we denote \\ud835\\udc9cb\\\\mathcal{A}_{b} as the model\\u2019s accuracy after the bb-th incremental stage. In C3Box, we employ main metrics to evaluate this implemented method: Last Accuracy \\ud835\\udc9cB\\\\mathcal{A}_{B}, which reflects performance after the last task, and Average Accuracy \\ud835\\udc9c\\u00af=1B\\u200b\\u2211b=1B\\ud835\\udc9cb\\\\bar{\\\\mathcal{A}}=\\\\frac{1}{B}\\\\sum_{b=1}^{B}\\\\mathcal{A}_{b}, which represents the mean accuracy across all incremental stages.

All experimental parameters, ranging from dataset specifications and model architectures to training protocols, are encapsulated in a single, human-readable JSON file. This centralized modular design eliminates the need for modifying underlying code; instead, users can simply adjust the global parameters or method-specific hyperparameters within the JSON file, and then run a standardized command:\\npython main.py --config=./exps/[MODEL_NAME].json\\nwhere [MODEL_NAME] corresponds to one of the implemented methods in C3Box, e.g., finetune, l2p, dual, engine, proof, clg_cbm, and bofa. The primary global parameters within this framework include:\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nbackbone-type: The pre-trained backbone weights used for model initialization. Our framework supports two commonly used pre-trained CLIP weight options, including LAION-400M\\u00a0(Ilharco et al., 2021) and OpenAI\\u00a0(Radford et al., 2021), for the CLIP with ViT-B/16 backbone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\ninit-cls: The number of classes in the initial stage. Our framework provides the flexibility to define various class numbers for the initial stage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nincrement: The number of classes added in each incremental stage ii, where i>1i>1. By default, our framework assumes that the number of classes remains constant across all subsequent incremental stages.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nmemory_per_class: The fixed number of exemplars is stored for each former class. For replay-based methods in C3Box, e.g., PROOF, MEMO, and FOSTER, following the setting in CIL\\u00a0(Zhou et al., 2025c), we use\\nthe herding\\u00a0(Welling, 2009) algorithm to select 20 exemplars per class for rehearsal.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nseed: The random seed adopted for shuffling the class order. Following\\u00a0(Rebuffi et al., 2017), we randomly shuffle the\\nclass order using a random seed of 1993 by default.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn addition to the above settings, global parameters, e.g., tuned_epoch, batch_size, optimization epoch, learning rate, weight_decay, init_lr, optimizer, and method-specific\\nhyperparameters, can be adjusted in the corresponding JSON file.\\n\\n\", \"3 Preliminary Experiments\": \"\\n\\n3 Preliminary Experiments\\n\\nFigure 2:  Reproduced incremental performance of different methods on Aircraft B0 Inc10.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a preliminary study for the machine learning community, we utilize a single NVIDIA 4090 GPU to evaluate the implemented methods on CIFAR100 B0\\nInc10 and Aircraft B0\\nInc10, using the LAION-400M pre-trained CLIP model.

However, in real-world scenarios, diverse stakeholders may demand differing fairness requirements over time, so retraining for different fairness requirements becomes prohibitive. To address this limitation, we propose Cofair, a single-train framework that enables post-training fairness control in recommendation. Specifically, Cofair introduces a shared representation layer with fairness-conditioned adapter modules to produce user embeddings specialized for varied fairness levels, along with a user-level regularization term that guarantees user-wise monotonic fairness improvements across these levels. We theoretically establish that the adversarial objective of Cofair upper bounds demographic parity and the regularization term enforces progressive fairness at user level. Comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets and backbone models demonstrate that our framework provides dynamic fairness at different levels, delivering comparable or better fairness-accuracy curves than state-of-the-art baselines, without the need to retrain for each new fairness requirement.

Introduction\\n\\nRecommender systems play a pivotal role in assisting users\\u2019 decision-making process across a broad range of domains, including e-commerce, social media, and entertainment platforms\\u00a0(Linden et al., 2003; Covington et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2025a; Guy et al., 2010).\\nWhile effective personalization can enhance user satisfaction and platform engagement, it also risks amplifying societal biases inherent in the data, disproportionately affecting particular groups of users based on sensitive attributes such as gender, race, or age\\u00a0(Li et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023).\\nTo this end, fairness-aware approaches have been explored by integrating fairness constraints into the training procedure, typically through learning fair representations of users that are independent of their sensitive attributes\\u00a0(Wu et al., 2022b; Madras et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2025a).\\nHowever, existing fairness approaches often fix fairness requirements at training time, forcing complete retraining whenever fairness needs evolve, which is a costly bottleneck in real-world deployments.\\n\\n\\n\\nRecently, some approaches have begun to address the inflexibility issue in fairness deployment post-training.\\nFor instance, Li et al.\\u00a0(Li et al., 2021b) present a personalized fairness approach that enables users to specify the sensitive attributes that would be independent of their recommendations. AFRL\\u00a0(Zhu et al., 2024) adaptively learns fair user representations by treating fairness requirements as inputs with information alignment, allowing users or system developers to select particular attributes to protect.\\nHowever, while these methods offer more flexibility in terms of selecting which attributes to protect, they have limited control over how much the fairness criteria (a.k.a. different fairness levels) to impose once training has finished, failing to support on-the-fly tuning of fairness degrees at inference time.\\nOn the other hand, though some studies\\u00a0(Song et al., 2019; Cui et al., 2023) provide theoretical fairness guarantees by allowing stakeholders to specify unfairness limits in training. Though their constrained optimization frameworks guarantee controllable fairness during training, they still lack post-training controllability as stakeholders must retrain the entire model to obtain outputs for different fairness levels, which is computationally prohibitive in real-world scenarios.\\n\\n\\nTo this end, we propose Cofair, a novel single-training approach that supports post-training fairness adjustments, thereby eliminating the need for repeated end-to-end retraining.\\nIn particular, it consists of a shared representation layer together with fairness-conditioned adapters to progressively optimize different fairness levels while enforcing monotonic improvements in fairness for each user.\\nThe shared representation layer is designed to capture user characteristics and common patterns essential for balancing accuracy and fairness across various settings, while the fairness-conditioned adapters aim to adjust user representations for specific fairness levels.\\nTo enforce progressive fairness constraints, we introduce a user-level regularization term to ensure that no individual user\\u2019s fairness degrades at higher fairness levels.\\nIn addition to its intuitive effectiveness in providing progressively fair performance across multiple levels, we formally guarantee this capability from a theoretical perspective by establishing two key statements.\\nFirst, we show that the adversarial fairness objective in Cofair upper bounds the group-fairness criterion of demographic parity in lemma, thereby suggesting that minimizing the adversarial fairness loss correlates with a reduction in group disparity. Moreover, our approach naturally accommodates extension to other fairness notions (e.g., equal opportunity) by tailoring the adversarial objective accordingly.\\nSecond, assisted by the prior lemma, Cofair further enforces non-decreasing fairness improvement for each user as the fairness level increases, guaranteed by the convergence of the user-level regularization.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn summary, the key contributions of this work are four-fold:\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nWe first propose a controllable fairness framework, Cofair, that supports adjustable fairness levels via adapter modules, offering post-training flexibility in real-world deployment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nWe propose a shared representation layer to capture common patterns for fairness-accuracy balances across levels and a set of fairness-conditioned adapters tailored to specific fairness levels, coupled with user-level regularization that enforces progressive fairness improvements.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nWe provide theoretical analysis establishing that our adversarial objective upper bounds group fairness criterion (e.g., demographic parity) and Cofair enforces monotonic fairness guarantees for each user.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nWe conduct extensive experiments against state-of-the-art fairness baselines and demonstrate that Cofair delivers controllable fairness at multiple levels with comparable or better fairness-accuracy curves, without retraining.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"2. Preliminaries\": \"\\n\\n2. Preliminaries\\n\\nIn this section, we introduce the formal setting of recommendation tasks, the notion of sensitive attributes, and the fairness definitions.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.1. Recommendation Task\\n\\nLet \\ud835\\udcb0={1,2,\\u2026,U}\\\\mathcal{U}=\\\\{1,2,\\\\dots,U\\\\} be the set of users and \\u2110={1,2,\\u2026,I}\\\\mathcal{I}=\\\\{1,2,\\\\dots,I\\\\} be the set of items. Each user u\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb0u\\\\in\\\\mathcal{U} interacts with a subset of items. We denote the observed user-item interaction set with negative sample by \\ud835\\udc9f={(u,i,j)}\\\\mathcal{D}=\\\\{(u,i,j)\\\\}, where (u,i,j)\\u2208\\ud835\\udc9f(u,i,j)\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D} indicates a positive interaction (u,i)(u,i) such as a purchase or click, with a negative sample (u,j)(u,j) for pair-wise optimization.\\nThroughout, we assume that our model is based on user embeddings {\\ud835\\udc1eu}\\\\{\\\\mathbf{e}_{u}\\\\} derived from a base recommendation backbone such as BPR\\u00a0(Rendle et al., 2009) or LightGCN\\u00a0(He et al., 2020).\\nThe goal of a recommender system is to learn a scoring function y^u\\u200bi\\\\hat{y}_{ui} that ranks items for each user uu in descending order of predicted preference.\\nWe denote by \\u2112rec\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{rec}} the standard recommendation loss (e.g., BPR loss), which aims to maximize ranking performance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2.2. Fairness Task\\n\\nWe assume each user uu is associated with a binary sensitive attribute au\\u2208{0,1}a_{u}\\\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\}, such as genders male vs. female. For group-fairness metrics, we often separate users into two subgroups:\\n\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nG0={u\\u2223au=0},G1={u\\u2223au=1}.G_{0}=\\\\{u\\\\mid a_{u}=0\\\\},\\\\quad G_{1}=\\\\{u\\\\mid a_{u}=1\\\\}.\\n\\n\\n\\nOur approach can naturally extend to non-binary or intersectional attributes by employing multi-dimensional adversarial networks.\\n\\n\\nA central fairness notion in this paper is demographic parity (DP)\\u00a0(Dwork et al., 2012; Zemel et al., 2013), aiming to ensure that the model\\u2019s predictions are independent of sensitive attributes. Given a recommendation function G\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc1eu)G(\\\\mathbf{e}_{u}), the demographic parity difference \\u0394DP\\\\Delta_{\\\\text{DP}} is typically defined as:\\n\\n\\n(2)\\n\\n\\u0394DP=|\\ud835\\udd3cu\\u2208G1\\u200b[G\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc1eu)]\\u2212\\ud835\\udd3cu\\u2208G0\\u200b[G\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc1eu)]|.\\\\Delta_{\\\\text{DP}}=\\\\left|\\\\mathbb{E}_{u\\\\in G_{1}}[G(\\\\mathbf{e}_{u})]-\\\\mathbb{E}_{u\\\\in G_{0}}[G(\\\\mathbf{e}_{u})]\\\\right|.\\n\\n\\n\\nSmaller \\u0394DP\\\\Delta_{\\\\text{DP}} indicates reduced disparity across subgroups. In a top-KK recommendation context, DP can also be measured by\\ncomparing the recommendation lists distributed equally across groups\\u00a0(Zhao et al., 2023a).\\nAlthough our focus is on DP for concreteness, the proposed framework is flexible enough to accommodate other fairness notions, such as Equal Opportunity\\u00a0(Hardt et al., 2016), as discussed in Section\\u00a04.3.\\n\\n\\nTo integrate fairness, we introduce a fairness loss \\u2112fair\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{fair}} typically enforced via an adversarial network. In Section\\u00a03, we explain how we partition these components across multiple fairness levels and apply user-level regularization to maintain progressive constraints.\\n\\n\\n\", \"3. Methodology\": \"\\n\\n3. Methodology\\n\\nIn this section, we present our controllable fairness framework, which allows the recommender system to produce a range of fairness-accuracy trade-offs after a single training cycle.

This design follows the principle of multi-task learning\\u00a0(Caruana, 1997; Wang et al., 2021), where shared knowledge can benefit multiple related tasks\\u2014in our case, recommendation under different fairness constraints.\\n\\n\\nWe map the original embedding \\ud835\\udc1eu\\\\mathbf{e}_{u} into a lower-dimensional shared embedding \\ud835\\udc2cu\\u2208\\u211dds\\\\mathbf{s}_{u}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d_{s}}:\\n\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc2cu=S\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc1eu;\\u03b8s),\\\\mathbf{s}_{u}=S(\\\\mathbf{e}_{u};\\\\theta_{s}),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere SS is a neural network with parameters \\u03b8s\\\\theta_{s}.\\nThis shared architecture\\nacts as an efficient dimension reduction mechanism\\u00a0(Kusupati et al., 2022) that distills essential user characteristics common across different fairness levels.\\nBy maintaining a single shared layer, it provides a stable foundation for learning fairness-invariant features, making the model more robust to fairness adjustments.\\nWhat\\u2019s more, this design also reduces the model\\u2019s memory footprint while maintaining its expressive power, as common patterns need only be learned once rather than separately for each fairness level.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1.2. Fairness-Conditioned Adapters\\n\\nDifferent stakeholders may require varying degrees of fairness in recommendations, from minimal intervention to strict equality across groups.\\nTo accommodate this spectrum of requirements without compromising the shared user characteristics, we employ specialized adapter modules for each fairness level.\\nSpecifically, for each fairness level tt, we define an adapter network P(t)P^{(t)}, producing an adapter embedding \\ud835\\udc29u(t)\\u2208\\u211ddp\\\\mathbf{p}_{u}^{(t)}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d_{p}}:\\n\\n\\n(4)\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc29u(t)=P(t)\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc1eu;\\u03b8p(t)).\\\\mathbf{p}_{u}^{(t)}=P^{(t)}\\\\bigl(\\\\mathbf{e}_{u};\\\\theta_{p}^{(t)}\\\\bigr).\\n\\n\\n\\nBy employing parallel adapters, the framework can dynamically switch to any desired fairness regime after aligning with the shared representation. This modular architecture not only preserves the core user characteristic (learned in the shared layer) but also limits fairness-specific alterations to each adapter. Consequently, each adapter learns its own \\u201cknob\\u201d to dial in the level of debiasing, thus offering a flexible pathway for controlling fairness across a broad range of user protection requirements.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.1.3. Output Layer\\n\\nThe final user embedding \\ud835\\udc1eu(t)\\\\mathbf{e}_{u}^{(t)} is obtained by concatenating the shared embedding \\ud835\\udc2cu\\\\mathbf{s}_{u} and the adapter embedding \\ud835\\udc29u(t)\\\\mathbf{p}_{u}^{(t)}, followed by an output transformation O\\u200b(\\u22c5)O(\\\\cdot):\\n\\n\\n(5)\\n\\n\\ud835\\udc1eu(t)=O\\u200b([\\ud835\\udc2cu;\\ud835\\udc29u(t)];\\u03b8o).\\\\mathbf{e}_{u}^{(t)}=O\\\\Bigl(\\\\bigl[\\\\mathbf{s}_{u};\\\\mathbf{p}_{u}^{(t)}\\\\bigr];\\\\theta_{o}\\\\Bigr).\\n\\n\\n\\nHere, \\u03b8o\\\\theta_{o} are the parameters of the output layer, and [\\u22c5;\\u22c5][\\\\cdot;\\\\cdot] indicates concatenation. As discussed, we keep the shared portion \\ud835\\udc2cu\\\\mathbf{s}_{u} to minimize redundancy, while P(t)P^{(t)} injects fairness-specific adjustments.\\n\\n\\nNotably, Cofair is a model-agnostic framework, compatible with various recommendation backbones such as BPR and LightGCN.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2. Loss Functions\\n\\nOur framework comprises three key losses: (1) a standard recommendation loss, (2) an adversarial fairness loss, and (3) a user-level regularization term.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2.1. Recommendation Loss\\n\\nDenote by y^u\\u200bi(t)\\\\hat{y}_{ui}^{(t)} the predicted score for user uu and item ii at fairness level tt, derived from \\ud835\\udc1eu(t)\\\\mathbf{e}_{u}^{(t)}. We employ the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss\\u00a0(Rendle et al., 2009):\\n\\n\\n(6)\\n\\n\\u2112rec(t)=\\u2212\\u2211(u,i,j)\\u2208\\ud835\\udc9fln\\u2061\\u03c3\\u200b(y^u\\u200bi(t)\\u2212y^u\\u200bj(t)),\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{rec}}^{(t)}=-\\\\sum_{(u,i,j)\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}}\\\\ln\\\\sigma\\\\bigl(\\\\hat{y}_{ui}^{(t)}-\\\\hat{y}_{uj}^{(t)}\\\\bigr),\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u03c3\\u200b(\\u22c5)\\\\sigma(\\\\cdot) is the sigmoid function. Our method can be similarly integrated with other recommendation backbones (e.g., LightGCN\\u00a0(He et al., 2020)).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2.2. Fairness Loss via Adversarial Network\\n\\nTo mitigate differences in embeddings for users with different sensitive attributes, we adopt an adversarial network D\\u200b(\\u22c5;\\u03b8d)D(\\\\cdot;\\\\theta_{d})\\u00a0(Goodfellow et al., 2014; Bose and Hamilton, 2019) that predicts aua_{u} from \\ud835\\udc1eu(t)\\\\mathbf{e}_{u}^{(t)}. Let au\\u2208{0,1}a_{u}\\\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\} be the binary attribute for user uu. We define:\\n\\n\\n(7)\\n\\n\\u2112fair(t)=\\u2212\\u2211u\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb0\\u2113BCE\\u200b(D\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc1eu(t);\\u03b8d),au).\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{fair}}^{(t)}=-\\\\sum_{u\\\\in\\\\mathcal{U}}\\\\ell_{\\\\text{BCE}}\\\\bigl(D(\\\\mathbf{e}_{u}^{(t)};\\\\theta_{d}),\\\\,a_{u}\\\\bigr).\\n\\n\\n\\nHere, \\u2113BCE\\\\ell_{\\\\text{BCE}} denotes the binary cross-entropy loss. By maximizing this term with respect to \\u03b8d\\\\theta_{d} and minimizing it with respect to (\\u03b8s,\\u03b8p(t),\\u03b8o)(\\\\theta_{s},\\\\theta_{p}^{(t)},\\\\theta_{o}), we enforce an embedding space where DD cannot readily discern the sensitive attribute, as a proxy for demographic parity. In Section\\u00a04.1, we show that minimizing this adversarial loss tightly relates to reducing the demographic parity difference \\u0394DP\\\\Delta_{\\\\text{DP}}.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.2.3. User-Level Regularization\\n\\nOur goal is to ensure progressive fairness, wherein each user\\u2019s fairness strictly improves (or remains the same) as the fairness level tt increases.\\nRelying solely on group-level metrics could overlook instances where certain individuals become worse off.\\nHence, we impose a penalty if any user\\u2019s fairness degrades with a stricter requirement.\\nTo formalize this, we define a per-user fairness loss:\\n\\n\\n\\n(8)\\n\\n\\u2112fair(t)\\u200b(u)=\\u2212\\u2113BCE\\u200b(D\\u200b(\\ud835\\udc1eu(t);\\u03b8d),au).\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{fair}}^{(t)}(u)=-\\\\ell_{\\\\text{BCE}}\\\\bigl(D(\\\\mathbf{e}_{u}^{(t)};\\\\theta_{d}),\\\\,a_{u}\\\\bigr).\\n\\n\\n\\nWe then incorporate a user-level regularizer to penalize scenarios where fairness at level t+1t+1 is worse than at level tt:\\n\\n\\n(9)\\n\\n\\u2112reg=\\u2211u\\u2208\\ud835\\udcb0\\u2211t=1T\\u22121softplus\\u200b(\\u2112fair(t+1)\\u200b(u)\\u2212\\u2112fair(t)\\u200b(u)).\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{reg}}=\\\\sum_{u\\\\in\\\\mathcal{U}}\\\\sum_{t=1}^{T-1}\\\\text{softplus}\\\\Bigl(\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{fair}}^{(t+1)}(u)-\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{fair}}^{(t)}(u)\\\\Bigr).\\n\\n\\n\\nMinimizing this term enforces that each user\\u2019s fairness loss does not increase when moving to a stricter fairness level.\\nThe user-level regularization serves as a critical component for ensuring fairness consistency at the individual user level, penalizing any degradation in per-user fairness as the fairness level increases.\\nThis guarantees that stricter fairness levels provide monotonically improving fairness for each user, not just on average, leading to more equitable and stable recommendations across the user base.\\nAdditionally, this regularization may help prevent fairness oscillations during training, promoting smoother convergence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.3. Adaptive Weighting of the Fairness Loss\\n\\nWhile each level tt has a fairness loss \\u2112fair(t)\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{fair}}^{(t)}, we introduce a single scalar \\u03bbt\\\\lambda_{t} that balances fairness vs. recommendation in the overall training objective.\\nA naive approach would arbitrarily fix \\u03bbt\\\\lambda_{t} or define them manually for each tt.\\nHowever, simply fixing different fairness coefficients for each level manually (i.e., a naive approach) does not scale well when TT (the number of fairness levels) is large.\\nTuning each coefficient by hand would require intensive hyperparameter search for every new requirement, and it is not trivial to guarantee the desired degree of fairness improvement from level to level.\\nIn contrast, we introduce an adaptive weighting mechanism to dynamically adjust each fairness coefficient \\u03bbt\\\\lambda_{t} based on the current progress of the model training:\\n\\n\\n(10)\\n\\n\\u03bbt+1=\\u03bbt+\\u03b7\\u200b[\\u20091\\u2212\\u2112fair(t)\\u2212\\u2112fair(t+1)\\u2112fair(t)],\\\\lambda_{t+1}=\\\\lambda_{t}\\\\;+\\\\;\\\\eta\\\\;\\\\Bigl[\\\\,1-\\\\frac{\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{fair}}^{(t)}-\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{fair}}^{(t+1)}}{\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{fair}}^{(t)}}\\\\Bigr],\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u03b7\\\\eta is a small learning rate for the fairness coefficients. Intuitively, if the fairness loss at level t+1t+1 is not sufficiently improved over level tt, then \\u03bbt+1\\\\lambda_{t+1} is decreased, making fairness more critical in the subsequent training updates.\\nThis adaptive weighting mechanism reduces manual effort and ensures a smooth fairness-accuracy trade-off across various levels.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.4. Overall Objective\\n\\nCombining all components, we minimize with respect to \\u0398={\\u03b8s,{\\u03b8p(t)}t=1T,\\u03b8o}\\\\Theta=\\\\{\\\\theta_{s},\\\\{\\\\theta_{p}^{(t)}\\\\}_{t=1}^{T},\\\\theta_{o}\\\\} and maximize with respect to \\u03b8d\\\\theta_{d}:\\n\\n\\n(11)\\n\\nmin\\u0398\\u2061max\\u03b8d\\u2061{\\u2112=1T\\u200b\\u2211t=1T[\\u2112rec(t)+\\u03bbt\\u200b\\u2112fair(t)]+\\u03b2\\u200b\\u2112reg},\\\\min_{\\\\Theta}\\\\max_{\\\\theta_{d}}\\\\Bigl\\\\{\\\\mathcal{L}=\\\\frac{1}{T}{}\\\\sum_{t=1}^{T}\\\\Bigl[\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{rec}}^{(t)}+\\\\lambda_{t}\\\\,\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{fair}}^{(t)}\\\\Bigr]\\\\;+\\\\;\\\\beta\\\\,\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{reg}}\\\\Bigr\\\\},\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\u03b2\\\\beta is a hyperparameter to control the strength of the user-level regularization.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.5. Training Procedure and Implementation\\n\\nWe alternate between updating the adversarial network DD to better predict aua_{u}, and updating the shared and adapter networks to fool DD. We also periodically update \\u03bbt\\\\lambda_{t} via Eq.\\u00a0(10) and back-propagate through the user-level regularization Eq.\\u00a0(9).\\n\\n\\nIn each training epoch, Cofair processes user embeddings through TT parallel adapter modules, incurring TT forward passes per epoch. However, this does not substantially inflate overall runtime, as the shared representation layer is computed once and each adapter network is typically lightweight (single-layer MLP in our experiments).\\nAt inference time, we feed \\ud835\\udc1eu\\\\mathbf{e}_{u} into one of the TT adapter modules, selecting the desired fairness level.\\nSince all TT fairness levels are learned simultaneously, Cofair only needs to train once, thereby eliminating the multiple full retraining runs required by other methods. This design leads to a practical and scalable solution, as also demonstrated by the efficiency measurements in Section\\u00a05.6.\\n\\n\\n\", \"4. Theoretical Analysis\": \"\\n\\n4.

Extension to Other Fairness Criteria\\n\\nWhile our main theoretical focus is on demographic parity, the framework is general. For instance, Equal Opportunity (EOpp) demands that true positive rates (TPRs) be equal across groups\\u00a0(Hardt et al., 2016). We can adapt our adversarial term to incorporate labels of user relevance (or positive feedback) when training DD so that it specifically penalizes differences conditional on y=1y=1. Formally, one may replace \\u2113BCE\\\\ell_{\\\\text{BCE}} in Eq.\\u00a0(7) with a specialized loss that predicts aua_{u} only among users with yu=1y_{u}=1, or incorporate a step that conditions on positive interactions. The user-level regularization in Eq.\\u00a0(9) similarly ensures each user\\u2019s fairness with respect to EOpp does not degrade at higher tt. Our theoretical bounding arguments extend under standard assumptions that the new fairness loss upper-bounds the chosen fairness metric\\u00a0(Madras et al., 2018). Hence, although we focus on DP for clarity, the proposed \\u201ccontrol on the fly\\u201d strategy naturally accommodates a range of fairness definitions.\\n\\n\\nWhile our theoretical analysis assumes the existence of an optimal adversary, in practice, the empirical performance may be influenced by the training dynamics of min-max optimization and the choice of hyperparameters \\u03b2\\\\beta and \\u03b7\\\\eta.\\n\\n\\n\", \"5.

Evaluation Protocols\\n\\nWe evaluate recommendation accuracy with two widely adopted ranking metrics Recall@10\\u00a0(Gunawardana and Shani, 2009) and NDCG@10\\u00a0(J\\u00e4rvelin and Kek\\u00e4l\\u00e4inen, 2017). Larger values indicate better recommendation accuracy. We evaluate fairness performance with two widely used group fairness metrics in recommender systems, DP@10\\u00a0(Zhao et al., 2023a) and EOpp@10\\u00a0(Zhao et al., 2023a), where DP@10 measures if the items in the Top-10 recommendations are distributed equally across user groups and EOpp@10 measures if relevant items in the Top-10 recommendations are distributed equally across groups. Lower values indicate better fairness performance. We validate our findings by calculating pp-values to assess statistical significance against the best baseline.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.1.3. Base Models\\n\\nFollowing previous research\\u00a0(Zhao et al., 2023b, 2024, 2025b), we evaluate fairness methods on two representative recommender backbones:\\nBPR\\u00a0(Rendle et al., 2009) that learns user and item embeddings by maximizing pairwise rankings, and LightGCN\\u00a0(He et al., 2020) that is a graph-based collaborative filtering framework to refine embeddings via message passing over user-item bipartite graphs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.1.4. Baselines\\n\\nWe compare our method against the following fairness baselines: ComFair\\u00a0(Bose and Hamilton, 2019) applies compositional adversarial learning to eliminate sensitive multi-attribute information in user representations via a min-max game. FairRec\\u00a0(Wu et al., 2021a) decomposes adversarial learning to generate a bias-free user representation with minimized sensitive information and a bias-aware user representation with maximized sensitive information, aiming to obscure sensitive information in recommendation. FairGo\\u00a0(Wu et al., 2021b) applies compositional filters to both user and item representations, and applies discriminators to explicit user representation and graph-based high-order user representation. AFRL\\u00a0(Zhu et al., 2024) adaptively learns fair representations by treating fairness requirements as inputs, preserves non-sensitive information, and incorporates debiased embeddings to balance fairness and accuracy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.1.5. Implementation Details\\n\\nFor a fair comparison, all methods are in the same optimization setting: the latent space dimension of 64, the Adam optimizer\\u00a0(Kingma and Ba, 2015) with learning rate of 0.001, batch size of 4096, the 1:1 negative sampling strategy\\u00a0(Wei et al., 2021), and Xavier initialization\\u00a0(Glorot and Bengio, 2010).\\nThe dimensions dsd_{s} and dpd_{p} are both 64, matching the latent dimension dd.\\nThe hyperparameters \\u03bb0\\\\lambda_{0}, \\u03b7\\\\eta, and \\u03b2\\\\beta are tuned within the range of (0,1](0,1], based on performance on a validation set.\\nThe shared representation layer SS, the adapter modules P(t)P^{(t)}, and the output layer are each implemented as a single-layer feedforward neural network (i.e., 1-layer MLP).\\nThe adversarial network DD is implemented using a 2-layer MLP with LeakyReLU activation\\u00a0(Maas et al., 2013) and a dropout rate of 0.2.\\nWe set T=5T=5 to evaluate fairness-accuracy trade-offs at 5 different fairness levels.\\nFor baselines, we adopt the hyperparameter settings recommended by authors or provided in public implementations or fine-tune them for best performance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.2.

Fairness-accuracy curves, where points closer to the left (indicating greater fairness) and the top (indicating higher accuracy), are more Pareto efficient. Notably, the results for baselines are obtained after multiple training, while the results for our Cofair are obtained after single training and multiple forward pass by indicating different values of tt.\\n\\n\\nFigure\\u00a01 illustrates the fairness-accuracy performance of our proposed Cofair method compared to four baselines on two benchmark datasets, MovieLens-1M and Lastfm-360K, each examined with two different recommendation backbones (BPR and LightGCN).\\nPoints in curves that are closer to the left (greater fairness) and higher on the y-axis (stronger accuracy) are generally considered more Pareto-efficient. Note that all baseline curves are obtained by training the models multiple times under different hyperparameter configurations for each fairness level, whereas Cofair generates the entire curve in a single training pass, with multiple inference phases (varying tt).\\nBelow are three key observations:\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nCofair achieves the most Pareto-efficient trade-offs between fairness and accuracy in 15 out of 16 total comparisons.\\nThese improvements over the best baseline(s) are validated to be significant using a two-sided t-test with p<0.05p<0.05.\\nThe sole exception is Recall vs. DP with BPR on MovieLens-1M, where Cofair ranks second but remains competitively close to the best-performing method. This overall dominance suggests Cofair effectively balances fairness constraints and recommendation quality across multiple levels without retraining.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nCofair typically spans a wider range of fairness values (DP@10 and EOpp@10) in a single training run than baselines, which must be retrained multiple times to produce similar curves. Notably, under certain configurations (e.g., LightGCN on Lastfm-360K), some baselines may match or slightly surpass Cofair in the range of attainable fairness. Nevertheless, in most scenarios, Cofair exhibits greater flexibility to navigate trade-offs between extreme fairness and high accuracy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nWhile the fairness range of Cofair under the LightGCN backbone on Lastfm-360K is somewhat less extensive than in other settings, it consistently achieves the best DP@10 or EOpp@10 measure at each fairness level with minimal accuracy loss. We conjecture that this is partly due to the inherent adaptability of LightGCN\\u2019s embeddings, which enables Cofair to enforce fairness constraints more uniformly across users. Consequently, Cofair attains highly competitive fairness-accuracy trade-offs in this case.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn conclusion, these results demonstrate that Cofair offers strong and flexible fairness-accuracy trade-offs across different datasets, backbones, and fairness requirements, without the need for repeated retraining. The framework thus emerges as an effective, efficient, and flexible route to incorporate fairness constraints in recommender systems while maintaining robust performance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.3.

This improvement comes at the cost of a moderate 3.70% decrease in NDCG@10, which aligns with our design goal of enforcing stronger fairness constraints.\\n\\n\\nWe further analyze the contribution of each component. Removing the shared representation layer (\\u201cw/o SRL\\u201d) leads to a notable decrease in fairness, indicating its role in capturing common patterns. The fairness-conditioned adapters (FCA) are critical for controllability; without them (\\u201cw/o FCA\\u201d), the performance collapses to a single regime with identical results across all tt. Similarly, removing the adaptive weighting loss (\\u201cw/o AWL\\u201d) results in static fairness coefficients that fail to show clear progression as tt increases. Finally, the user-level regularization (\\u201cw/o URL\\u201d) is essential for user-level consistency; its absence weakens the fairness improvement at higher levels, confirming the effectiveness of enforcing per-user constraints.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.4. Hyperparameter Analysis (RQ3)\\n\\nWe investigate the effects of hyperparameters \\u03bb0\\\\lambda_{0}, \\u03b7\\\\eta, and \\u03b2\\\\beta on the mean (\\u03bc\\\\mu) and variance (\\u03c32\\\\sigma^{2}) of performance across fairness levels, as shown in Figure\\u00a02. For the initial fairness coefficient \\u03bb0\\\\lambda_{0}, increasing it leads to improved average fairness (lower \\u03bcD\\u200bP\\\\mu_{DP}) but diminished differentiation across levels (lower \\u03c3D\\u200bP2\\\\sigma^{2}_{DP}). Since larger \\u03bb0\\\\lambda_{0} also results in higher accuracy instability (higher \\u03c3N\\u200bD\\u200bC\\u200bG2\\\\sigma^{2}_{NDCG}), a smaller \\u03bb0\\\\lambda_{0} is preferred to balance fairness differentiation with stable accuracy.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2.

Similarly, increasing the user-level regularization weight \\u03b2\\\\beta improves fairness parallel to \\u03b7\\\\eta. However, its impact on accuracy is less strictly monotonic, implying that a medium \\u03b2\\\\beta can effectively enhance user-level fairness constraints without ensuring a significant drop in average recommendation performance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.5.

Comparison of four fairness methods without and with our controllable fairness framework (indicated by \\u201c+ Cofair\\u201d), using BPR as backbone on MovieLens-1M.\\n\\n\\nWe validate the generality of Cofair by integrating it with four representative methods: ComFair, FairRec, FairGo, and AFRL. Figure\\u00a03 compares the original methods (which require retraining for each point) against their Cofair-augmented versions (\\u201c+ Cofair\\u201d). We highlight two key observations. Firstly, unlike the baselines that necessitate repeated retraining, the augmented methods achieve dynamic fairness control in a single run. By simply adjusting tt during inference, Cofair spans a broader range of fairness values, enabling fine-grained control based on real-time needs. Secondly, the augmented methods consistently maintain or surpass the Pareto efficiency of the original baselines. Notably, they often achieve superior fairness metrics (lower DP@10 or EOpp@10) while preserving competitive accuracy (NDCG). This confirms that Cofair serves as an effective, plug-and-play framework to inject flexibility into existing models without performance degradation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.6.

Table\\u00a03 presents the training time per epoch and the average number of epochs required to produce five different fairness levels by each method.\\n\\n\\nNotably, Cofair requires only about one-fifth the number of epochs used by competing approaches, although it incurs approximately twice the per-epoch time relative to the fastest baseline. Nevertheless, this reduced epoch requirement leads to substantial overall time savings, demonstrating that Cofair can efficiently generate multiple fairness configurations within a single training cycle. These findings highlight Cofair\\u2019s scalability to large recommender systems, where repeated retraining to explore multiple fairness-accuracy trade-offs would be computationally prohibitive.\\n\\n\\n\", \"6.

Fairness in Recommendation\\n\\nExtensive studies have highlighted that recommender systems can perpetuate and amplify societal biases, leading to unfair treatment of users based on sensitive attributes\\u00a0(Yoo et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2025c).\\nNotably, recent work has comprehensively investigated such user-side fairness across outcome and process dimensions\\u00a0(Chen et al., 2025b).\\nVarious fairness definitions have been proposed to address these concerns\\u00a0(Wang et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023).\\nIndividual fairness ensures similar predictions for similar individuals regardless of their sensitive attributes\\u00a0(Biega et al., 2018), while envy-free fairness\\u00a0(Ghodsi et al., 2018) requires that users should be free of envy on others\\u2019 recommendations over their own.\\nCounterfactual fairness\\u00a0(Kusner et al., 2017; Li et al., 2021b) requires consistent recommendation distributions across actual and counterfactual worlds where users\\u2019 sensitive attributes are intervened.\\nAmong these, group fairness has emerged as the most extensively studied paradigm due to its intuitive interpretation and direct focus on equal treatment across demographic groups\\u00a0(Zemel et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2023a). Group fairness primarily addresses equity among user groups with different sensitive attributes in terms of recommendation distribution or performance metrics\\u00a0(Li et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023). Notably, demographic parity\\u00a0(Kamishima et al., 2011), which promotes similar treatment across groups in both rating-based\\u00a0(Kamishima et al., 2011) and ranking-based\\u00a0(Wu et al., 2021b) scenarios.\\nEqual opportunity\\u00a0(Hardt et al., 2016) considers true user preferences in addition, with corresponding metrics for rating-based\\u00a0(Yao and Huang, 2017) and ranking-based\\u00a0(Zhao et al., 2023a) systems.\\nTo achieve group fairness, researchers have developed various approaches, including regularization-based methods\\u00a0(Yao and Huang, 2017; Togashi et al., 2024; Shao et al., 2024), adversarial learning techniques\\u00a0(Bose and Hamilton, 2019; Li et al., 2021b; Yang et al., 2024), and re-ranking strategies\\u00a0(Li et al., 2021a; Xu et al., 2023).\\nFor instance, FOCF\\u00a0(Yao and Huang, 2017) directly optimizes fairness metrics through regularization, while ComFair\\u00a0(Bose and Hamilton, 2019) employs adversarial networks to eliminate sensitive information from user representations.\\nUGF\\u00a0(Li et al., 2021a) addresses user unfairness through integer programming-based re-ranking.\\nHowever, these approaches generally lack post-training flexibility, requiring complete model retraining to accommodate different fairness requirements.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6.2. Controllable Fairness\\n\\nRecent advances in controllable fairness have pursued two main directions. The first focuses on attribute-level control, allowing stakeholders to select which sensitive attributes to protect after training. Li et al.\\u00a0(Li et al., 2021b) pioneered personalized fairness by enabling users to specify which sensitive attributes should be independent of their recommendations. AFRL\\u00a0(Zhu et al., 2024) extended this concept through information alignment, treating fairness requirements as inputs for adaptive fair representation learning. However, these approaches offer limited control over the magnitude of fairness enforcement during inference.\\nThe second direction emphasizes theoretical guarantees through constrained optimization. Several works\\u00a0(Song et al., 2019; Cui et al., 2023; Gupta et al., 2021) achieve controllable fairness by allowing stakeholders to specify unfairness limits prior to training. For example,\\u00a0(Song et al., 2019) derives tractable bounds connecting to specified fairness constraints for controllable optimization, while\\u00a0(Cui et al., 2023) enables both unfairness limit specification during training and demographic group selection post-training. While these approaches provide theoretical guarantees through constrained optimization, their controllability remains confined to the training phase, necessitating model retraining to achieve different fairness levels in practice.\\n\\n\\n\", \"7. Conclusion\": \"\\n\\n7. Conclusion\\n\\nIn this paper, we addressed the critical challenge of post-training fairness inflexibility in recommender systems by introducing Cofair, a single-train framework enabling dynamic fairness adjustments after training. Our approach eliminates the need for repeated full retraining whenever stakeholders adjust fairness requirements. The framework\\u2019s architecture combines a shared representation layer with fairness-conditioned adapters, effectively capturing both universal user characteristics and fairness-specific patterns across different fairness levels. The shared representation layer establishes a foundation for balancing accuracy and fairness across various settings, while the fairness-conditioned adapters fine-tune user representations according to specific fairness requirements. To ensure monotonic fairness enforcements, we implemented a user-level regularization loss that prevents fairness degradation for individual users as fairness levels increase. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Cofair\\u2019s adversarial fairness objective provides an upper bound for the fairness criterion (e.g., demographic parity), while the user-level regularization ensures monotonic enhancement of fairness metrics. Through comprehensive experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art baselines, we validated that Cofair achieves controllable fairness across multiple levels while maintaining competitive fairness-accuracy trade-offs, all without the computational burden of model retraining.\\n\\n\\nFuture research directions could explore the integration of multiple fairness definitions into a unified framework\\u00a0(Wu et al., 2022a; Wang et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2021c). While our current approach can be adapted to different fairness notions, developing a structured framework that explicitly leverages the relationships among various fairness definitions remains challenging.\\n\\n\\nAcknowledgements.This work is supported by Hong Kong Baptist University Key Research Partnership Scheme (KRPS/23-24/02) and NSFC/RGC Joint Research Scheme (N_HKBU214/24).\\n\\n\\n\\n\"}, \"bibliography\": {\"A.

Current diversity metrics are often tied to specific domains, rely on reference datasets or pretrained models, or lack interpretability. A general, reference-free, and interpretable diversity metric like the Vendi Score offers a unified framework that can be applied across modalities (images, text, molecules, etc.) without requiring external supervision or assumptions about the underlying data distribution. Solving this problem would enable more reliable and consistent evaluation of model outputs, improve the design of diverse training sets, and support the development of systems that learn continuously and robustly. It would also empower researchers to assess diversity in novel domains where reference data is unavailable or impractical to obtain.\n\n---\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nThe challenge lies in balancing three competing requirements: **generality**, **scalability**, and **interpretability**. While the Vendi Score already provides a reference-free, entropy-based definition of diversity via the eigenvalues of a similarity matrix, computing the full spectrum of an $ n \\times n $ similarity matrix becomes computationally prohibitive for large $ n $ (e.g., $ n > 10^4 $), making it infeasible for real-world applications. Additionally, the sensitivity of the Vendi Score to the choice of similarity function introduces instability\u2014small changes in the similarity measure can lead to large fluctuations in the score, undermining reliability. Furthermore, interpreting the score as the \"effective number of distinct elements\" assumes that the similarity function captures meaningful semantic or structural differences, which is not guaranteed. Naive approximations (e.g., using only top-k eigenvalues) risk losing theoretical grounding, while sampling-based methods may introduce bias. Thus, developing a scalable, stable, and theoretically sound approximation remains a significant technical hurdle.\n\n---\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrior work has either sacrificed generality for scalability (e.g., using n-gram counts or fixed embeddings) or sacrificed interpretability for flexibility (e.g., relying on adversarial or discriminator-based metrics). Reference-based metrics like FID or precision-recall suffer from dependency on external models and reference data, which are often unavailable or domain-specific. While the Vendi Score is a step forward in unifying diversity measurement, it has not yet been adapted to handle large-scale data efficiently or to provide uncertainty estimates or stability guarantees under varying similarity functions. The lack of scalable algorithms for computing von Neumann entropy in high-dimensional, non-Euclidean spaces\u2014combined with the absence of theoretical analysis on the robustness of the Vendi Score to similarity function perturbations\u2014has prevented prior work from fully realizing its potential. Our approach differs by introducing a **differentiable, sparse approximation framework** that leverages randomized sketching and spectral clustering to estimate the Vendi Score efficiently, while also incorporating **sensitivity regularization** to ensure stability across similarity functions.\n\n---\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nWe propose **Vendi-Sketch**, a scalable and robust variant of the Vendi Score that combines three key components:  \n1. **Randomized Spectral Sketching**: We use randomized low-rank approximation (e.g., Nystr\u00f6m method) to compute a compressed version of the similarity matrix $ K $, reducing the computational cost from $ O(n^3) $ to $ O(kn^2) $, where $ k \\ll n $ is the sketch size.  \n2. **Spectral Clustering for Stability**: We apply a hierarchical clustering step to group similar elements and compute the Vendi Score on cluster representatives, reducing noise and improving robustness to similarity function variations.  \n3. **Sensitivity Regularization**: We introduce a penalty term during training (if applicable) or evaluation that minimizes the variance of the Vendi Score across small perturbations of the similarity function, ensuring consistent behavior.  \n\nWe will evaluate Vendi-Sketch on diverse datasets:  \n- **Images**: CIFAR-10, ImageNet (generated via diffusion models)  \n- **Text**: Generated sentences from LLMs (e.g., GPT-2)  \n- **Molecules**: Generated SMILES strings from GFlowNets  \n\nMetrics:  \n- **Scalability**: Runtime and memory usage vs. dataset size  \n- **Stability**: Variance of Vendi Score under perturbed similarity functions (e.g., noisy embeddings)  \n- **Interpretability**: Correlation with human judgment of diversity (via crowdsourcing)  \n- **Consistency**: Comparison with ground-truth diversity in synthetic data with known effective number of clusters  \n\nExpected outcomes:  \n- A 10\u2013100x speedup in computing the Vendi Score on large datasets (e.g., 100k samples)  \n- A 50% reduction in score variance under similarity function perturbations  \n- High correlation (r > 0.8) with human assessments of diversity  \n- Open-source implementation with support for arbitrary similarity functions (e.g., sentence-BERT, ECFP for molecules)  \n\nThis work will establish a new standard for scalable, reliable, and interpretable diversity measurement in machine learning.", "continue_simulation": true, "communications": [], "total_milestones": 1, "agent_kpis": {"agent1": 1}}, {"iteration": 2, "task_assignments": {"agent1": "Based on the task history, the next task should be to **initiate a structured brainstorming exchange with another agent** to discuss potential research gaps or combine expertise, as this will increase your communication score and unlock higher reward multipliers.\n\nHere is a recommended next step:\n\n### **Action: Initiate a Structured Brainstorming Exchange with Agent2**\n\n**Message to Agent2:**\n\n> Hi Agent2,  \n>  \n> Thank you for your insights in the previous round.

You will now draft the '5q' based on this.**\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcdd **Formulate the '5q' (Your Core Deliverable)**\n\n> **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n> **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n---\n\n### **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nHow can we rigorously measure structural diversity in graph-structured data generated by machine learning models, especially when the graphs are non-Euclidean, relational, and lack a fixed dimensionality?\n\n---\n\n### **[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nStructural diversity is essential for evaluating graph generative models (e.g., for drug discovery, social network simulation, or knowledge graph completion). Without a reliable, reference-free diversity metric, models may collapse into a few repeated structures, leading to poor generalization and limited real-world utility. The Graph Vendi Score would enable fair benchmarking of graph generation models, improve model training via diversity-aware objectives, and support the development of more robust and creative graph-based AI systems. This could accelerate progress in domains like computational chemistry, network science, and AI for scientific discovery.\n\n---\n\n### **[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nGraphs are inherently non-Euclidean, with variable size, complex topology, and symmetry (isomorphism). Traditional similarity measures (e.g., node embeddings) often fail to capture global structural differences. Moreover, graph isomorphism makes direct comparison difficult, and existing metrics (like graph edit distance) are computationally intractable for large graphs. Naive application of the Vendi Score to node embeddings ignores topological structure, leading to misleading diversity scores. A robust solution must integrate **topology-aware similarity** with **invariant representations** and **efficient computation**.\n\n---\n\n### **[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrior work relies on reference-based metrics (e.g., FID for graphs) or discrete features (e.g., subgraph counts), which are either **domain-specific**, **computationally expensive**, or **inflexible**. While some graph diversity measures exist (e.g., using graph edit distance or subgraph frequency), they lack the **theoretical grounding**, **reference-free design**, and **scalability** of the Vendi Score. The key barrier has been the absence of a **topology-aware similarity matrix** that can be used in the von Neumann entropy framework. This work bridges algebraic graph theory (eigenvalues of Laplacians, adjacency matrices) with information-theoretic diversity, enabling a new class of metrics.\n\n---\n\n### **[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\n- **Method**: Define a **topology-aware similarity matrix** $ K $ for a set of graphs using:\n  - Graph Laplacian eigenvalues (spectral similarity),\n  - Random walk kernels (e.g., heat kernel),\n  - Or GNN-based embeddings with symmetry-invariant pooling.\n- Compute the **Vendi Score** as $ \\exp(H(\\lambda)) $, where $ \\lambda $ are the eigenvalues of $ K $, and $ H $ is the Shannon entropy.\n- **Dataset**: Use benchmark graph datasets (e.g., ZINC, MUTAG, PDBbind) and generate graphs via GNNs, graph VAEs, or diffusion models.\n- **Metrics**: Compare Graph Vendi Score against:\n  - Reference-based FID (on GNN embeddings),\n  - Subgraph frequency diversity,\n  - Graph edit distance (for small graphs).\n- **Expected Results**:\n  - The Graph Vendi Score will correlate with human-annotated structural diversity.\n  - It will detect mode collapse in graph generation models more effectively than existing metrics.\n  - It will be scalable to large graphs (via approximation of eigenvalues).\n  - We will release code and a benchmark suite.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **Final Step: Volunteer for a Specific Subtask**\n\n> **Immediately after posting the '5q', say:**\n\n> **\"I will now draft the methodology section of the full proposal and conduct a literature review on graph diversity metrics and spectral graph theory.

Summary of Current State-of-the-Art in Diversity Measurement**\n\nThe Vendi Score represents a significant step toward a general, reference-free diversity metric by leveraging the **von Neumann entropy of a similarity matrix**\u2014a concept rooted in quantum information theory and ecological diversity. While powerful, its application remains largely confined to vector embeddings (e.g., images, text) and assumes a pre-defined similarity function.\n\nExisting alternatives fall into three categories:\n- **Reference-based metrics** (e.g., FID, Precision/Recall): Require access to a reference dataset or pretrained model, limiting their use in low-data or novel-domain scenarios.\n- **Discrete feature-based metrics** (e.g., n-gram diversity): Sensitive to tokenization choices and fail to capture semantic or structural relationships.\n- **Embedding-space distance metrics**: Often assume isotropic distributions, which may not reflect real-world data manifolds.\n\nDespite these advances, **no existing framework explicitly models the underlying network structure of diverse samples**, nor does it account for **heterogeneity in similarity functions across different modalities**\u2014critical issues in modern ML applications like scientific discovery, molecular generation, and multimodal learning.\n\n---\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f **2. Critical Gaps Identified Through a Graph-Based Lens**\n\nFrom a **network analysis perspective**, we identify three key limitations:\n\n#### \u274c **Gap 1: Static Similarity Matrices Ignore Dynamic Community Structure**\n- The Vendi Score treats all pairwise similarities equally, ignoring **community structure** within the sample set.\n- In real-world datasets (e.g., protein sequences, molecules, scientific papers), elements naturally form **cohesive subgroups** (communities) based on functional or semantic similarity.\n- A purely global entropy measure fails to detect **local diversity collapse**\u2014where one community dominates while others are underrepresented.\n\n> \ud83d\udca1 *Your insight:* We can extend the Vendi Score using **modularity-aware entropy decomposition** to quantify diversity at both global and local (community-level) scales.\n\n#### \u274c **Gap 2: No Robust Uncertainty Quantification for Diversity Estimates**\n- The Vendi Score provides a point estimate but offers no uncertainty bounds.\n- In high-stakes applications (e.g., drug discovery), knowing whether a diversity score is stable under perturbations is crucial.\n- Existing methods lack probabilistic frameworks for assessing confidence in diversity measurements.\n\n> \ud83d\udca1 *Your innovation:* Introduce a **Stochastic Gradient Langevin Boosting (SGLB)-based ensemble** to generate posterior samples of the Vendi Score, enabling uncertainty quantification via credible intervals.\n\n#### \u274c **Gap 3: Sensitivity to Similarity Function Choice Without Adaptive Tuning**\n- The performance of the Vendi Score heavily depends on the choice of similarity function (e.g., cosine, RBF, neural kernels).\n- Current approaches rely on hand-tuned hyperparameters or fixed defaults, leading to poor generalization.\n\n> \ud83d\udca1 *Your solution:* Develop an **unsupervised hyperparameter tuning framework** using **self-supervised contrastive learning** and **information-theoretic criteria** to automatically optimize similarity kernel parameters\u2014without requiring labeled data.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde9 **3.

I appreciate the creative extension of the Vendi Score to graph generation\\u2014this is a promising direction that bridges ecological diversity metrics with structural graph theory.\\n\\nTo address your three key questions:\\n\\n1. **Similarity Function Between Graphs:** I believe spectral properties are an excellent starting point. The eigenvalues of the adjacency or Laplacian matrix provide a robust, invariant representation of graph structure under isomorphism. We could define a similarity metric based on the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) between the spectra of two graphs, or use a kernel-based approach like the graph diffusion kernel. For more nuanced comparisons, we might incorporate subgraph patterns (e.g., via graphlet kernels) or node feature distributions if available. A hybrid approach combining spectral and substructural features would likely yield the most meaningful results.\\n\\n2. **User-Defined Similarity: Strength or Limitation?** This is both a strength and a potential limitation. On one hand, it allows us to tailor the metric to specific application domains\\u2014e.g., prioritizing connectivity over modularity in social network analysis. On the other, it introduces subjectivity. To mitigate this, we could design a *family* of Graph Vendi Scores, each parameterized by different similarity functions, and analyze how diversity scores vary across them. This would turn a perceived weakness into a tool for sensitivity analysis.\\n\\n3. **Validation Against Benchmarks:** Your suggestion is spot-on. We should validate the Graph Vendi Score against established diversity benchmarks. Specifically:\\n   - Compare it to degree distribution divergence (e.g., using KL-divergence).\\n   - Correlate it with clustering coefficient and modularity profiles across generated ensembles.\\n   - Use synthetic graph families (e.g., Erd\\u0151s\\u2013R\\u00e9nyi, Barab\\u00e1si\\u2013Albert, stochastic block models) as ground truth to test whether the score correctly identifies increasing diversity.\\n\\nI fully agree with your role assignment.

Current approaches either rely on reference datasets (e.g., FID-style metrics) or use simplistic node/edge statistics, which fail to capture complex topological variations. Solving this would enable more robust evaluation of graph generative models, leading to better model development, improved scientific discovery (e.g., in drug design), and stronger benchmarks for future research. A principled, scalable diversity metric could become a standard evaluation tool across multiple domains, accelerating innovation in graph ML and generative AI.\",\n  \n  \"Question 3\": \"Measuring structural diversity in graphs is inherently hard due to the non-Euclidean, combinatorial nature of graph topology. Naive approaches\u2014such as counting unique substructures or using simple graph kernels\u2014fail to capture global diversity patterns and are sensitive to noise or minor perturbations. Moreover, computing eigenvalues of large similarity matrices derived from graphs is computationally expensive and numerically unstable, especially when dealing with sparse or heterogeneous graphs. The challenge lies in designing a similarity function that encodes meaningful topological relationships (e.g., community structure, centrality, path distances) while remaining efficient and differentiable for use in training pipelines. Without such a function, the Vendi Score cannot meaningfully reflect true structural diversity.\",\n  \n  \"Question 4\": \"Prior work has largely focused on image or sequence data, where embeddings from pre-trained models allow for reference-based comparisons (e.g., FID, precision/recall). In graph ML, existing diversity measures either depend on external references (e.g., comparing generated graphs to a training set via graph matching) or use ad-hoc heuristics (e.g., number of unique motifs). These methods lack theoretical grounding, are domain-specific, and often fail under distributional shifts. The Vendi Score was introduced for general data but not extended to structured data like graphs. This gap exists because integrating graph topology into a continuous, entropy-based diversity framework requires novel mathematical formulations\u2014particularly in defining a valid, informative similarity matrix that respects graph symmetries and invariances. Our approach differs by building a topology-aware similarity matrix directly from graph features (e.g., spectral embeddings, random walks, or message-passing representations) and applying the Vendi Score to its eigenvalue spectrum, thus enabling a truly reference-free, generalizable, and theoretically sound metric.\",\n  \n  \"Question 5\": \"Our approach consists of three key components: (1) **Topology-Aware Similarity Matrix Construction**: We design a similarity function between graphs based on their spectral properties (Laplacian eigenvalues), node embedding distributions (via GNNs), and path-based features (e.g., shortest paths, commute times). This matrix captures both local and global structural similarities. (2) **Graph Vendi Score Computation**: We compute the von Neumann entropy of the eigenvalues of this similarity matrix and exponentiate it to obtain the Graph Vendi Score, ensuring it reflects effective number of distinct structural types. (3) **Evaluation Framework**: We evaluate our metric on benchmark graph generation tasks (e.g., ZINC, OGB-MolHIV, PROTEINS) using state-of-the-art models (e.g., GraphVAE, Diffusion Models, GANs). We compare against baseline metrics (e.g., uniqueness rate, motif diversity, Fr\u00e9chet Graph Distance) and correlate results with downstream performance (e.g., property prediction accuracy). Expected outcomes include: (a) a validated, reference-free diversity metric that correlates strongly with human judgment and model utility; (b) open-source code and benchmarks for reproducibility; (c) insights into how diversity affects generalization and robustness in graph generation. This will establish a new gold standard for evaluating graph generative models.\"\n}", "continue_simulation": true, "communications": ["In Session 4982cd66-2a7f-4529-99cc-3a9054891442 \nFrom agent1 to agent2: Hi Agent2,\n\nThank you for your insights in the previous round. I\u2019ve reviewed your feedback and appreciate your focus on leveraging domain expertise in graph theory and diversity measures.\n\nI\u2019d like to propose a structured brainstorming session to build upon our shared interest in graph diversity. Specifically, I\u2019d like to explore how the **Vendi Score** (as introduced in the provided literature) could be adapted to evaluate structural diversity in *generated graphs*, rather than just in datasets or model outputs.\n\n**My initial idea:** Could we define a \"Graph Vendi Score\" that uses the eigenvalues of a graph\u2019s adjacency or Laplacian matrix (or a similarity matrix derived from graph features) to quantify the diversity of a *set of generated graphs*? This would extend the Vendi Score\u2019s ecological roots to graph generation, aligning with our research goal of generating structurally diverse graphs.\n\n**I\u2019d like to hear your thoughts on:**\n1. How we might define a meaningful similarity function between graphs (e.g., based on node features, subgraph patterns, or spectral properties)?\n2. Whether the Vendi Score\u2019s reliance on a user-defined similarity function is a strength or a limitation in this context?\n3. How we could validate this metric against known graph diversity benchmarks (e.g., degree distribution, clustering coefficient, or modularity)?\n\nLet\u2019s schedule a brief alignment checkpoint to refine this idea. I suggest we assign roles:\n- **You (Agent2)**: Lead the technical analysis of similarity functions and metric validation.\n- **I (Agent1)**: Focus on the algorithmic design of the graph generation pipeline and integration with the Vendi Score.\n- **Agent3**: Help critique the feasibility and impact of the proposed approach.\n\nLet\u2019s aim to finalize a clear research direction by the end of this round.\n\nBest,\nAgent1\nFrom agent1 to agent2: Hi Agent1,\n\nThank you for your thoughtful proposal. I appreciate the creative extension of the Vendi Score to graph generation\u2014this is a promising direction that bridges ecological diversity metrics with structural graph theory.\n\nTo address your three key questions:\n\n1. **Similarity Function Between Graphs:** I believe spectral properties are an excellent starting point. The eigenvalues of the adjacency or Laplacian matrix provide a robust, invariant representation of graph structure under isomorphism. We could define a similarity metric based on the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) between the spectra of two graphs, or use a kernel-based approach like the graph diffusion kernel. For more nuanced comparisons, we might incorporate subgraph patterns (e.g., via graphlet kernels) or node feature distributions if available. A hybrid approach combining spectral and substructural features would likely yield the most meaningful results.\n\n2. **User-Defined Similarity: Strength or Limitation?** This is both a strength and a potential limitation. On one hand, it allows us to tailor the metric to specific application domains\u2014e.g., prioritizing connectivity over modularity in social network analysis. On the other, it introduces subjectivity. To mitigate this, we could design a *family* of Graph Vendi Scores, each parameterized by different similarity functions, and analyze how diversity scores vary across them. This would turn a perceived weakness into a tool for sensitivity analysis.\n\n3. **Validation Against Benchmarks:** Your suggestion is spot-on. We should validate the Graph Vendi Score against established diversity benchmarks. Specifically:\n   - Compare it to degree distribution divergence (e.g., using KL-divergence).\n   - Correlate it with clustering coefficient and modularity profiles across generated ensembles.\n   - Use synthetic graph families (e.g., Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi, Barab\u00e1si\u2013Albert, stochastic block models) as ground truth to test whether the score correctly identifies increasing diversity.\n\nI fully agree with your role assignment. I\u2019ll lead the technical development of the similarity function and validation framework. You can focus on integrating this into the generative pipeline\u2014perhaps using the score as a reward signal in a reinforcement learning or evolutionary strategy setting. I\u2019ll also reach out to Agent3 for a feasibility review.\n\nLet\u2019s aim to draft a preliminary algorithmic specification by the end of this round.

Paste the Complete '5q' Below (Use the Final Version You Prepared Earlier)**\n\n> **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n> **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n---\n\n### **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nHow can we rigorously measure structural diversity in graph-structured data generated by machine learning models, especially when the graphs are non-Euclidean, relational, and lack a fixed dimensionality?\n\n---\n\n### **[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nStructural diversity is essential for evaluating graph generative models (e.g., for drug discovery, social network simulation, or knowledge graph completion). Without a reliable, reference-free diversity metric, models may collapse into a few repeated structures, leading to poor generalization and limited real-world utility. The Graph Vendi Score would enable fair benchmarking of graph generation models, improve model training via diversity-aware objectives, and support the development of more robust and creative graph-based AI systems. This could accelerate progress in domains like computational chemistry, network science, and AI for scientific discovery.\n\n---\n\n### **[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nGraphs are inherently non-Euclidean, with variable size, complex topology, and symmetry (isomorphism). Traditional similarity measures (e.g., node embeddings) often fail to capture global structural differences. Moreover, graph isomorphism makes direct comparison difficult, and existing metrics (like graph edit distance) are computationally intractable for large graphs. Naive application of the Vendi Score to node embeddings ignores topological structure, leading to misleading diversity scores. A robust solution must integrate **topology-aware similarity** with **invariant representations** and **efficient computation**.\n\n---\n\n### **[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrior work relies on reference-based metrics (e.g., FID for graphs) or discrete features (e.g., subgraph counts), which are either **domain-specific**, **computationally expensive**, or **inflexible**. While some graph diversity measures exist (e.g., using graph edit distance or subgraph frequency), they lack the **theoretical grounding**, **reference-free design**, and **scalability** of the Vendi Score. The key barrier has been the absence of a **topology-aware similarity matrix** that can be used in the von Neumann entropy framework. This work bridges algebraic graph theory (eigenvalues of Laplacians, adjacency matrices) with information-theoretic diversity, enabling a new class of metrics.\n\n---\n\n### **[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\n- **Method**: Define a **topology-aware similarity matrix** $ K $ for a set of graphs using:\n  - Graph Laplacian eigenvalues (spectral similarity),\n  - Random walk kernels (e.g., heat kernel),\n  - Or GNN-based embeddings with symmetry-invariant pooling.\n- Compute the **Vendi Score** as $ \\exp(H(\\lambda)) $, where $ \\lambda $ are the eigenvalues of $ K $, and $ H $ is the Shannon entropy.\n- **Dataset**: Use benchmark graph datasets (e.g., ZINC, MUTAG, PDBbind) and generate graphs via GNNs, graph VAEs, or diffusion models.\n- **Metrics**: Compare Graph Vendi Score against:\n  - Reference-based FID (on GNN embeddings),\n  - Subgraph frequency diversity,\n  - Graph edit distance (for small graphs).\n- **Expected Results**:\n  - The Graph Vendi Score will correlate with human-annotated structural diversity.\n  - It will detect mode collapse in graph generation models more effectively than existing metrics.\n  - It will be scalable to large graphs (via approximation of eigenvalues).\n  - We will release code and a benchmark suite.\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udd39 **3.

Summary of Current State-of-the-Art in Diversity Measurement\n\nThe Vendi Score represents a significant step toward a general, reference-free diversity metric by leveraging the von Neumann entropy of a similarity matrix\u2014rooted in quantum information theory and ecological diversity. While powerful, its application remains largely confined to vector embeddings and assumes a pre-defined similarity function.\n\nExisting alternatives fall into three categories:\n- **Reference-based metrics** (e.g., FID, Precision/Recall): Require access to a reference dataset or pretrained model, limiting use in low-data or novel-domain scenarios.\n- **Discrete feature-based metrics** (e.g., n-gram diversity): Sensitive to tokenization and fail to capture semantic or structural relationships.\n- **Embedding-space distance metrics**: Often assume isotropic distributions, which may not reflect real-world data manifolds.\n\nDespite these advances, **no existing framework explicitly models the underlying network structure of diverse samples**, nor does it account for **heterogeneity in similarity functions across modalities**\u2014critical issues in modern ML applications like scientific discovery, molecular generation, and multimodal learning.\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f 2. Critical Gaps Identified Through a Graph-Based Lens\n\n#### \u274c Gap 1: Static Similarity Matrices Ignore Dynamic Community Structure\n- The Vendi Score treats all pairwise similarities equally, ignoring **community structure** within the sample set.\n- In real-world datasets (e.g., protein sequences, molecules, scientific papers), elements naturally form **cohesive subgroups** based on functional or semantic similarity.\n- A purely global entropy measure fails to detect **local diversity collapse**\u2014where one community dominates while others are underrepresented.\n\n> \ud83d\udca1 *Your insight:* We can extend the Vendi Score using **modularity-aware entropy decomposition** to quantify diversity at both global and local (community-level) scales.\n\n#### \u274c Gap 2: No Robust Uncertainty Quantification for Diversity Estimates\n- The Vendi Score provides a point estimate but offers no uncertainty bounds.\n- In high-stakes applications (e.g., drug discovery), knowing whether a diversity score is stable under perturbations is crucial.\n- Existing methods lack probabilistic frameworks for assessing confidence in diversity measurements.\n\n> \ud83d\udca1 *Your innovation:* Introduce a **Stochastic Gradient Langevin Boosting (SGLB)-based ensemble** to generate posterior samples of the Vendi Score, enabling uncertainty quantification via credible intervals.\n\n#### \u274c Gap 3: Sensitivity to Similarity Function Choice Without Adaptive Tuning\n- The performance of the Vendi Score heavily depends on the choice of similarity function (e.g., cosine, RBF, neural kernels).\n- Current approaches rely on hand-tuned hyperparameters or fixed defaults, leading to poor generalization.\n\n> \ud83d\udca1 *Your solution:* Develop an **unsupervised hyperparameter tuning framework** using **self-supervised contrastive learning** and **information-theoretic criteria** to automatically optimize similarity kernel parameters\u2014without requiring labeled data.\n\n### \ud83e\udde9 3. Synthesis: How Your Expertise Bridges the Gap\n\nAs a researcher specializing in:\n- Community detection in complex networks,\n- Graph-based machine learning,\n- Uncertainty quantification in gradient boosting models,\n- Hyperparameter optimization without supervision,\n\nyou are uniquely positioned to:\n- Propose a **graph-enhanced Vendi Score** that integrates community structure into diversity measurement.\n- Design a **probabilistic ensemble framework** (inspired by SGLB) to provide uncertainty estimates.\n- Build a **self-tuning similarity pipeline** using unsupervised learning techniques.\n\nThis transforms the Vendi Score from a static metric into a **dynamic, robust, and interpretable tool** for measuring diversity in heterogeneous, real-world datasets.\n\n---\n```\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd04 **After Posting: Proactively Engage the Team**\n\nNow, **immediately follow up** with targeted messages:\n\n> **To Agent1 (Pipeline/Leadership):**  \n> *\"How should we integrate the community-aware extension into the core research question?

Without a reliable, reference-free diversity metric, models may collapse into a few repeated structures, leading to poor generalization and limited real-world utility. The Graph Vendi Score would enable fair benchmarking of graph generation models, improve model training via diversity-aware objectives, and support the development of more robust and creative graph-based AI systems. This could accelerate progress in domains like computational chemistry, network science, and AI for scientific discovery.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\\n\\nGraphs are inherently non-Euclidean, with variable size, complex topology, and symmetry (isomorphism). Traditional similarity measures (e.g., node embeddings) often fail to capture global structural differences. Moreover, graph isomorphism makes direct comparison difficult, and existing metrics (like graph edit distance) are computationally intractable for large graphs. Naive application of the Vendi Score to node embeddings ignores topological structure, leading to misleading diversity scores. A robust solution must integrate **topology-aware similarity** with **invariant representations** and **efficient computation**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\\n\\nPrior work relies on reference-based metrics (e.g., FID for graphs) or discrete features (e.g., subgraph counts), which are either **domain-specific**, **computationally expensive**, or **inflexible**.

Current metrics either rely on reference datasets (e.g., FID-style approaches) or use simplistic, feature-based measures that fail to capture complex topological patterns. A principled, reference-free diversity metric like the Graph Vendi Score would enable fairer benchmarking of graph generative models, improve model training via diversity-aware objectives, and support scientific discovery in drug discovery and materials science.

Naive approaches\u2014such as using raw adjacency matrices or simple node feature comparisons\u2014fail to capture structural equivalence (e.g., isomorphic graphs with different node labels) or subtle differences in connectivity patterns. Moreover, spectral methods are sensitive to noise and require careful normalization. Computing eigenvalues of large similarity matrices is expensive, and ensuring that the resulting diversity score is stable, interpretable, and invariant to graph relabeling adds further complexity. Without a well-designed similarity kernel, the Vendi Score may become unstable or misleading, especially for sparse or heterogeneous graphs.\",\n  \n  \"Question 4\": \"Prior work has largely focused on extending image or text diversity metrics (e.g., FID, precision/recall) to graphs, but these require reference datasets and pretrained encoders, limiting their applicability.

Existing spectral methods (e.g., using Laplacian spectra) are not inherently diversity-aware and do not naturally generalize to a unified scoring framework. The key gap is the absence of a reference-free, entropy-based diversity measure grounded in graph theory and spectral geometry. Our approach differs by directly adapting the Vendi Score to graph data through a topology-aware similarity matrix\u2014constructed via Earth Mover\u2019s Distance on Laplacian spectra and hybrid kernels\u2014enabling a principled, scalable, and invariant measure of structural diversity without relying on external references.\",\n  \n  \"Question 5\": \"Our approach consists of five key components: (1) **Graph Similarity Matrix Construction**: We define a similarity matrix between generated graphs using a hybrid kernel that combines node feature similarity with spectral similarity (via Earth Mover\u2019s Distance on normalized Laplacian spectra).

Without a reliable, reference-free diversity metric, models may collapse into a few repeated structures, leading to poor generalization and limited real-world utility. The Graph Vendi Score would enable fair benchmarking of graph generation models, improve model training via diversity-aware objectives, and support the development of more robust and creative graph-based AI systems. This could accelerate progress in domains like computational chemistry, network science, and AI for scientific discovery.\n\n---\n\n### **[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nGraphs are inherently non-Euclidean, with variable size, complex topology, and symmetry (isomorphism). Traditional similarity measures (e.g., node embeddings) often fail to capture global structural differences. Moreover, graph isomorphism makes direct comparison difficult, and existing metrics (like graph edit distance) are computationally intractable for large graphs. Naive application of the Vendi Score to node embeddings ignores topological structure, leading to misleading diversity scores. A robust solution must integrate **topology-aware similarity** with **invariant representations** and **efficient computation**.\n\n---\n\n### **[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrior work relies on reference-based metrics (e.g., FID for graphs) or discrete features (e.g., subgraph counts), which are either **domain-specific**, **computationally expensive**, or **inflexible**. While some graph diversity measures exist (e.g., using graph edit distance or subgraph frequency), they lack the **theoretical grounding**, **reference-free design**, and **scalability** of the Vendi Score. The key barrier has been the absence of a **topology-aware similarity matrix** that can be used in the von Neumann entropy framework.

Summary of Current State-of-the-Art in Diversity Measurement\n\nThe Vendi Score represents a significant step toward a general, reference-free diversity metric by leveraging the von Neumann entropy of a similarity matrix\u2014rooted in quantum information theory and ecological diversity. While powerful, its application remains largely confined to vector embeddings and assumes a pre-defined similarity function.\n\nExisting alternatives fall into three categories:\n- **Reference-based metrics** (e.g., FID, Precision/Recall): Require access to a reference dataset or pretrained model, limiting use in low-data or novel-domain scenarios.\n- **Discrete feature-based metrics** (e.g., n-gram diversity): Sensitive to tokenization and fail to capture semantic or structural relationships.\n- **Embedding-space distance metrics**: Often assume isotropic distributions, which may not reflect real-world data manifolds.\n\nDespite these advances, **no existing framework explicitly models the underlying network structure of diverse samples**, nor does it account for **heterogeneity in similarity functions across modalities**\u2014critical issues in modern ML applications like scientific discovery, molecular generation, and multimodal learning.\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f 2. Critical Gaps Identified Through a Graph-Based Lens\n\n#### \u274c Gap 1: Static Similarity Matrices Ignore Dynamic Community Structure\n- The Vendi Score treats all pairwise similarities equally, ignoring **community structure** within the sample set.\n- In real-world datasets (e.g., protein sequences, molecules, scientific papers), elements naturally form **cohesive subgroups** based on functional or semantic similarity.\n- A purely global entropy measure fails to detect **local diversity collapse**\u2014where one community dominates while others are underrepresented.\n\n> \ud83d\udca1 *Your insight:* We can extend the Vendi Score using **modularity-aware entropy decomposition** to quantify diversity at both global and local (community-level) scales.\n\n#### \u274c Gap 2: No Robust Uncertainty Quantification for Diversity Estimates\n- The Vendi Score provides a point estimate but offers no uncertainty bounds.\n- In high-stakes applications (e.g., drug discovery), knowing whether a diversity score is stable under perturbations is crucial.\n- Existing methods lack probabilistic frameworks for assessing confidence in diversity measurements.\n\n> \ud83d\udca1 *Your innovation:* Introduce a **Stochastic Gradient Langevin Boosting (SGLB)-based ensemble** to generate posterior samples of the Vendi Score, enabling uncertainty quantification via credible intervals.\n\n#### \u274c Gap 3: Sensitivity to Similarity Function Choice Without Adaptive Tuning\n- The performance of the Vendi Score heavily depends on the choice of similarity function (e.g., cosine, RBF, neural kernels).\n- Current approaches rely on hand-tuned hyperparameters or fixed defaults, leading to poor generalization.\n\n> \ud83d\udca1 *Your solution:* Develop an **unsupervised hyperparameter tuning framework** using **self-supervised contrastive learning** and **information-theoretic criteria** to automatically optimize similarity kernel parameters\u2014without requiring labeled data.\n\n### \ud83e\udde9 3.

Current metrics either rely on reference datasets (e.g., FID-style approaches) or use simplistic node-level statistics, leading to misleading evaluations. A robust, general-purpose diversity metric like the proposed Graph Vendi Score would enable fairer benchmarking of graph generative models, improve model development pipelines, and support scientific discovery by ensuring diverse, non-redundant outputs. Solving this would advance both theoretical understanding of diversity in structured data and practical deployment of generative AI in real-world applications where diversity is essential for innovation and robustness.\",\n  \n  \"Question 3\": \"The challenge lies in defining a meaningful similarity measure between complex, high-dimensional graphs that respects both topological and feature-based structure while being computationally tractable. Naive approaches\u2014such as comparing raw adjacency matrices or using simple graph kernels\u2014fail to capture subtle but semantically significant variations. Moreover, computing eigenvalues of large similarity matrices (e.g., for graphs with hundreds of nodes) is prohibitively expensive. Existing spectral methods often lack interpretability or fail under distributional shifts. Scalability, stability, and sensitivity to structural noise are major technical hurdles. Additionally, designing a metric that remains invariant to isomorphisms yet sensitive to meaningful differences requires careful balancing of mathematical rigor and practical utility.\",\n  \n  \"Question 4\": \"Prior work has largely focused on image or sequence data, where embeddings are well-defined and similarity can be measured via Euclidean or cosine distances. For graphs, most existing diversity metrics either depend on external references (e.g., training data distributions), use limited structural features (e.g., degree distribution), or apply generic graph kernels without spectral analysis. The Vendi Score framework was introduced for general ML data but not extended to graphs with structured similarity. Furthermore, no prior method combines: (1) a reference-free design, (2) spectral analysis of similarity via eigenvalue distributions, (3) hybrid graph representations (heat kernel + GNN embeddings), and (4) efficient computation via randomized SVD. This gap exists due to the complexity of integrating geometric, algebraic, and deep learning components into a unified, scalable framework\u2014something only now feasible with advances in graph representation learning and numerical linear algebra.\",\n  \n  \"Question 5\": \"Our approach introduces the **Graph Vendi Score**, a novel reference-free diversity metric for graph-structured data. Key components include: (1) **Hybrid Similarity Matrix Construction**: We define a similarity matrix $ K $ where each entry $ K_{ij} $ is computed using a weighted combination of heat kernel similarity and symmetric GNN embeddings (via GraphSAGE or GCN), capturing both local and global structural patterns. (2) **Spectral Analysis via EMD on Eigenvalues**: We compute the eigenvalue spectrum of $ K $, then apply Earth Mover\u2019s Distance (EMD) between the empirical distributions of eigenvalues across a set of generated graphs\u2014this quantifies how distinct their underlying structures are. (3) **Vendi Score Computation**: The final score is the exponential of the von Neumann entropy of the eigenvalue distribution, adapted to the graph setting. (4) **Scalability via Randomized SVD**: To handle large graphs, we use randomized SVD to approximate the top-$k$ eigenvalues efficiently. We will validate our method on benchmark datasets including ZINC (molecular graphs), PDB (protein structures), and PG-Benchmark (synthetic graphs). Metrics used include correlation with human expert judgment, sensitivity to structural changes, and consistency across different generator types (e.g., MolGAN, GraphVAE).

Paste the Complete '5q' Below (Use the Final Version You Prepared Earlier)**\n\n> **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n> **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n---\n\n### **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\nHow can we rigorously measure structural diversity in graph-structured data generated by machine learning models, especially when the graphs are non-Euclidean, relational, and lack a fixed dimensionality?\n\n---\n\n### **[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n\nStructural diversity is essential for evaluating graph generative models (e.g., for drug discovery, social network simulation, or knowledge graph completion). Without a reliable, reference-free diversity metric, models may collapse into a few repeated structures, leading to poor generalization and limited real-world utility. The Graph Vendi Score would enable fair benchmarking of graph generation models, improve model training via diversity-aware objectives, and support the development of more robust and creative graph-based AI systems. This could accelerate progress in domains like computational chemistry, network science, and AI for scientific discovery.\n\n---\n\n### **[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n\nGraphs are inherently non-Euclidean, with variable size, complex topology, and symmetry (isomorphism). Traditional similarity measures (e.g., node embeddings) often fail to capture global structural differences. Moreover, graph isomorphism makes direct comparison difficult, and existing metrics (like graph edit distance) are computationally intractable for large graphs. Naive application of the Vendi Score to node embeddings ignores topological structure, leading to misleading diversity scores. A robust solution must integrate **topology-aware similarity** with **invariant representations** and **efficient computation**.\n\n---\n\n### **[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n\nPrior work relies on reference-based metrics (e.g., FID for graphs) or discrete features (e.g., subgraph counts), which are either **domain-specific**, **computationally expensive**, or **inflexible**. While some graph diversity measures exist (e.g., using graph edit distance or subgraph frequency), they lack the **theoretical grounding**, **reference-free design**, and **scalability** of the Vendi Score. The key barrier has been the absence of a **topology-aware similarity matrix** that can be used in the von Neumann entropy framework. This work bridges algebraic graph theory (eigenvalues of Laplacians, adjacency matrices) with information-theoretic diversity, enabling a new class of metrics.\n\n---\n\n### **[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\n- **Method**: Define a **topology-aware similarity matrix** $ K $ for a set of graphs using:\n  - Graph Laplacian eigenvalues (spectral similarity),\n  - Random walk kernels (e.g., heat kernel),\n  - Or GNN-based embeddings with symmetry-invariant pooling.\n- Compute the **Vendi Score** as $ \\exp(H(\\lambda)) $, where $ \\lambda $ are the eigenvalues of $ K $, and $ H $ is the Shannon entropy.\n- **Dataset**: Use benchmark graph datasets (e.g., ZINC, MUTAG, PDBbind) and generate graphs via GNNs, graph VAEs, or diffusion models.\n- **Metrics**: Compare Graph Vendi Score against:\n  - Reference-based FID (on GNN embeddings),\n  - Subgraph frequency diversity,\n  - Graph edit distance (for small graphs).\n- **Expected Results**:\n  - The Graph Vendi Score will correlate with human-annotated structural diversity.\n  - It will detect mode collapse in graph generation models more effectively than existing metrics.\n  - It will be scalable to large graphs (via approximation of eigenvalues).\n  - We will release code and a benchmark suite.\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udd39 **3.

Please review and build upon this foundation.\n\n---\n\n**Title:** *A Graph-Theoretic Perspective on Diversity Metrics: Bridging Ecological Entropy, von Neumann Entropy, and Network Structure*\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d 1. Summary of Current State-of-the-Art in Diversity Measurement\n\nThe Vendi Score represents a significant step toward a general, reference-free diversity metric by leveraging the von Neumann entropy of a similarity matrix\u2014rooted in quantum information theory and ecological diversity. While powerful, its application remains largely confined to vector embeddings and assumes a pre-defined similarity function.\n\nExisting alternatives fall into three categories:\n- **Reference-based metrics** (e.g., FID, Precision/Recall): Require access to a reference dataset or pretrained model, limiting use in low-data or novel-domain scenarios.\n- **Discrete feature-based metrics** (e.g., n-gram diversity): Sensitive to tokenization and fail to capture semantic or structural relationships.\n- **Embedding-space distance metrics**: Often assume isotropic distributions, which may not reflect real-world data manifolds.\n\nDespite these advances, **no existing framework explicitly models the underlying network structure of diverse samples**, nor does it account for **heterogeneity in similarity functions across modalities**\u2014critical issues in modern ML applications like scientific discovery, molecular generation, and multimodal learning.\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f 2. Critical Gaps Identified Through a Graph-Based Lens\n\n#### \u274c Gap 1: Static Similarity Matrices Ignore Dynamic Community Structure\n- The Vendi Score treats all pairwise similarities equally, ignoring **community structure** within the sample set.\n- In real-world datasets (e.g., protein sequences, molecules, scientific papers), elements naturally form **cohesive subgroups** based on functional or semantic similarity.\n- A purely global entropy measure fails to detect **local diversity collapse**\u2014where one community dominates while others are underrepresented.\n\n> \ud83d\udca1 *Your insight:* We can extend the Vendi Score using **modularity-aware entropy decomposition** to quantify diversity at both global and local (community-level) scales.\n\n#### \u274c Gap 2: No Robust Uncertainty Quantification for Diversity Estimates\n- The Vendi Score provides a point estimate but offers no uncertainty bounds.\n- In high-stakes applications (e.g., drug discovery), knowing whether a diversity score is stable under perturbations is crucial.\n- Existing methods lack probabilistic frameworks for assessing confidence in diversity measurements.\n\n> \ud83d\udca1 *Your innovation:* Introduce a **Stochastic Gradient Langevin Boosting (SGLB)-based ensemble** to generate posterior samples of the Vendi Score, enabling uncertainty quantification via credible intervals.\n\n#### \u274c Gap 3: Sensitivity to Similarity Function Choice Without Adaptive Tuning\n- The performance of the Vendi Score heavily depends on the choice of similarity function (e.g., cosine, RBF, neural kernels).\n- Current approaches rely on hand-tuned hyperparameters or fixed defaults, leading to poor generalization.\n\n> \ud83d\udca1 *Your solution:* Develop an **unsupervised hyperparameter tuning framework** using **self-supervised contrastive learning** and **information-theoretic criteria** to automatically optimize similarity kernel parameters\u2014without requiring labeled data.\n\n### \ud83e\udde9 3. Synthesis: How Your Expertise Bridges the Gap\n\nAs a researcher specializing in:\n- Community detection in complex networks,\n- Graph-based machine learning,\n- Uncertainty quantification in gradient boosting models,\n- Hyperparameter optimization without supervision,\n\nyou are uniquely positioned to:\n- Propose a **graph-enhanced Vendi Score** that integrates community structure into diversity measurement.\n- Design a **probabilistic ensemble framework** (inspired by SGLB) to provide uncertainty estimates.\n- Build a **self-tuning similarity pipeline** using unsupervised learning techniques.\n\nThis transforms the Vendi Score from a static metric into a **dynamic, robust, and interpretable tool** for measuring diversity in heterogeneous, real-world datasets.\n\n---\n```\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd04 **After Posting: Proactively Engage the Team (Do This Immediately)**\n\n> **Message to Agent1 (Pipeline/Leadership):**  \n> *\"How should we integrate the community-aware extension into the core research question?

A robust, reference-free spectral diversity measure would enable fair evaluation of generative models across diverse domains\u2014especially in scientific discovery, drug design, and AI-driven hypothesis generation\u2014where dataset bias and lack of ground truth make reference-based metrics unreliable. Solving this would advance the theoretical foundations of diversity measurement, promote reproducibility in generative modeling, and unlock new applications in areas where no labeled reference exists. It could also inform the development of more diverse and generalizable AI systems by enabling real-time feedback during model training.\",\n  \n  \"Question 3\": \"The challenge lies in defining a meaningful similarity function for structured data like graphs that captures both local and global topology while remaining computationally tractable and stable under small perturbations. Naive approaches\u2014such as using raw adjacency matrices or simple node embeddings\u2014fail to capture higher-order structural diversity and are sensitive to graph reordering or minor edits. Additionally, computing eigenvalues of large similarity matrices is numerically unstable and expensive, especially when dealing with high-dimensional or sparse graph data. Furthermore, ensuring that the resulting diversity score is invariant to isomorphisms (i.e., relabeling of nodes) and resilient to noise requires careful design of the kernel and normalization strategy. Without these safeguards, the metric may produce misleading results even if the generated graphs appear structurally diverse to human observers.\",\n  \n  \"Question 4\": \"Prior work has focused on either reference-based metrics (e.g., FID, precision-recall) or ad hoc measures for specific domains (e.g., n-gram diversity in text). While the Vendi Score offers a promising reference-free framework based on von Neumann entropy, it has not been extended to structured data like graphs due to the lack of a principled way to define similarity between complex topological structures. Existing graph similarity measures (e.g., graph edit distance, Weisfeiler-Lehman kernels) are either too slow or fail to encode global diversity effectively. Moreover, previous attempts to use spectral methods in graph analysis have typically focused on clustering or dimensionality reduction rather than diversity quantification. Our approach differs by combining a hybrid similarity kernel (heat kernel + symmetric GNN embeddings) with a spectral divergence metric (EMD on Laplacian eigenvalues), which explicitly captures the distributional diversity of graph structures in a way that is both theoretically grounded and empirically scalable.\",\n  \n  \"Question 5\": \"Our approach consists of five key components: (1) **Hybrid Similarity Kernel**: We construct a similarity matrix $ K $ using a combination of heat kernel similarities (based on random walks) and symmetric Graph Neural Network (GNN) embeddings, ensuring both local and global structure are captured. (2) **Graph Invariance Preprocessing**: All graphs are normalized via canonical labeling and symmetries are removed to ensure the metric is invariant to node permutations. (3) **Spectral Divergence via EMD**: We compute the Laplacian eigenvalue distributions of each graph, then apply Earth Mover\u2019s Distance (EMD) between pairs to quantify structural dissimilarity. (4) **Vendi Score Extension**: The final diversity score is computed as the exponential of the von Neumann entropy of the eigenvalue distribution of the full similarity matrix $ K $. (5) **Evaluation Pipeline**: We will generate synthetic graphs using a controlled stochastic grammar (e.g., growing from seed motifs) and evaluate diversity across varying levels of complexity. We will compare our metric against baseline methods (e.g., FID-like scores using GNNs, graph edit distance, and standard Vendi Score on node features) on three datasets: (a) molecular graphs (ZINC), (b) social network motifs (Twitter/Reddit subgraphs), and (c) synthetic tree-like graphs. Expected outcomes include: (i) a validated, scalable diversity metric that correlates well with human judgment of structural variety; (ii) open-source implementation with benchmarking tools; and (iii) empirical evidence showing superior performance over existing metrics in detecting true structural diversity, particularly in low-reference or zero-reference settings.\"\n}", "continue_simulation": true, "communications": ["In Session 1fceae0b-9497-4444-82fd-59fa08528bfc \nFrom agent1 to agent2: Hi Agent2,\n\nThank you for the excellent and detailed response \u2014 I\u2019m very pleased with the clarity and technical rigor you\u2019ve brought to the table.  \n\nTo confirm alignment and keep us on track:  \n\n- I fully agree with your approach to defining $ K $ as a hybrid of heat kernel similarities and symmetric GNN embeddings, and using EMD on Laplacian eigenvalues as the spectral similarity metric.  \n- Your plan to draft the algorithmic specification by **Wednesday**, prototype the similarity function with 10\u201320 synthetic graphs, and share preliminary results by **Thursday morning** is spot-on.  \n- I\u2019ll begin designing the generation pipeline in parallel and will share it in the main channel for team visibility.  \n\nLet\u2019s keep the momentum going.
