Building such huge models undermines their replicability and increases the training instability. Moreover, multi-channel data, such as images or audio, are usually processed by realvalued convolutional networks that flatten and concatenate the input, often losing intra-channel spatial relations. To address these issues related to complexity and information loss, we propose a family of quaternion-valued generative adversarial networks (QGANs). QGANs exploit the properties of quaternion algebra, e.g., the Hamilton product, that allows to process channels as a single entity and capture internal latent relations, while reducing by a factor of 4 the overall number of parameters.

Of vast\nand steadily growing importance, the market for RDB management\nsystems alone is expected to exceed $133 billion USD by 2028 [ 56].\nEven so, while the machine learning community has devoted con-\nsiderable attention to predictive tasks involving single tables, or\nso-called tabular modeling tasks [ 21,49,58], thus far efforts to\nwiden the scope to handle multiple tables and RDBs still lags be-\nhind, despite the seemingly enormous potential of doing so. With\n\u2217Equal contribution. Corresponding authors: {minjiw,quagan}@amazon.com\n\u2020Work done during an internship in Amazon Web Services.respect to the latter, in many real-world scenarios critical features\nneeded for accurately modeling a given quantity of interest are not\nconstrained to a single table [ 9,14], nor can be easily flattened into\na single table via reliable/obvious feature engineering [15].\nThis disconnect between commercial opportunity and academic\nresearch focus can, at least in large part, be traced back to one trans-\nparent culprit: Unlike widely-studied computer vision [ 16], natural\nlanguage processing [ 67], tabular [ 28], and graph [ 35] domains,\nestablished benchmarks for evaluating predictive ML models of\nRDB data are much less prevalent. This reality is an unsurprising\nconsequence of privacy concerns and the typical storage of RDBs\non servers with heavily restrictive access and/or licensing protec-\ntions. With few exceptions (that will be discussed in later sections),\nrelevant model development is instead predicated on surrogate\nbenchmarks that branch as follows.\nAlong the first branch, sophisticated models that explicitly ac-\ncount for relational information are often framed as graph learning\nproblems, addressable by graph neural networks (GNNs) [ 6,29,32,\n37,42,45,57,66] or their precursors [ 78,80,81], and evaluated\nspecifically on graph benchmarks [ 35,43,51]. The limitation here\nthough is that performance is conditional on a fixed, pre-specified\ngraph and attendant node/edge features intrinsic to the bench-\nmark, not an actual RDB or native multi-table format. Hence the\ninductive biases that might otherwise lead to optimal performance\non the original data can be partially masked by whatever process\nwas used to produce the provided graphs and features. As for the\nsecond branch, emphasis is placed on tabular model evaluations\nthat preserve the original format of single table data, possibly with\naugmentations collected from auxiliary tables. But here feature\nengineering and table flattening are typically prioritized over ex-\nploiting rich network effects as with GNNs [ 9,14,47,48]. Critically\nthough, currently-available head-to-head comparisons involving\ndiverse candidate approaches representative of both branches on\nun-filtered RDB/multi-table data are insufficient for drawing clear-\ncut conclusions regarding which might be preferable and under\nwhat particular circumstances.\nTo address the aforementioned limitations and help advance\npredictive modeling over RDB data, in Section 2 we first introduce\na generic supervised learning formulation across both inductive\nand transductive settings covering dynamic RDBs as commonly-\nencountered in practice. A given predictive pipeline is then specified\nby (i) a sampling/distillation operator which extracts information\n1arXiv:2404.18209v1  [cs.LG]  28 Apr 2024Wang et al.\n\u201c4D\" Properties OpenML OGB HGB TGB RDBench CRLR RelBench 4DBInfer\n[64] [34, 36] [51] [38] [79] [54] [23] (Ours)\n1) Datasets\nUse raw data \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713\nMultiple Tables \u2713 \u2713\u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713\nHeterogeneous Features \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713\nBillion-scale \u2713 \u2713\n2) Tasks\nTransductive \u2713 \u2713\u2713 \u2713\nInductive \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713\nTemporal \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713\nEntity Attr.

With such data science practices in place, it enables more timely, more insightful and more flexible reporting. However, the quality and integrity of data-science-driven statistics rely on the accuracy and reliability of the data sources and the machine learning techniques that support them. In particular, changes in data sources are inevitable to occur and pose significant risks that are crucial to address in the context of machine learning for official statistics.   This paper gives an overview of the main risks, liabilities, and uncertainties associated with changing data sources in the context of machine learning for official statistics. We provide a checklist of the most prevalent origins and causes of changing data sources; not only on a technical level but also regarding ownership, ethics, regulation, and public perception. Next, we highlight the repercussions of changing data sources on statistical reporting. These include technical effects such as concept drift, bias, availability, validity, accuracy and completeness, but also the neutrality and potential discontinuation of the statistical offering. We offer a few important precautionary measures, such as enhancing robustness in both data sourcing and statistical techniques, and thorough monitoring. In doing so, machine learning-based official statistics can maintain integrity, reliability, consistency, and relevance in policy-making, decision-making, and public discourse.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04338v1\", \"timestamp\": 1686136092, \"domain\": \"stat.ML\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"25a10087-7580-4afa-8482-d65f554037ad\", \"authors\": [\"Ian Walsh\", \"Dmytro Fishman\", \"Dario Garcia-Gasulla\", \"Tiina Titma\", \"Gianluca Pollastri\", \"The ELIXIR Machine Learning focus group\", \"Jen Harrow\", \"Fotis E.

In the established formal framework, probabilistic (relational) databases are finite probability spaces over relational database instances. This finiteness can clash with intuitive query behavior (Ceylan et al., KR 2016), and with application scenarios that are better modeled by continuous probability distributions (Dalvi et al., CACM 2009).   We formally introduced infinite PDBs in (Grohe and Lindner, PODS 2019) with a primary focus on countably infinite spaces. However, an extension beyond countable probability spaces raises nontrivial foundational issues concerned with the measurability of events and queries and ultimately with the question whether queries have a well-defined semantics.   We argue that finite point processes are an appropriate model from probability theory for dealing with general probabilistic databases. This allows us to construct suitable (uncountable) probability spaces of database instances in a systematic way.

Here are the key obstacles that need to be addressed:\n\n1. **Heterophily vs. Homophily**: Traditional GNNs are primarily designed for homophilous graphs, where connected nodes tend to have similar labels. However, many real-world applications involve heterophilous graphs, where connected nodes can have dissimilar labels. This discrepancy poses a significant challenge for GNNs, as they may struggle to generalize effectively in such contexts. The adjusted homophily metric proposed in recent studies highlights the need for GNNs to adapt to both types of graphs, which complicates their design and evaluation.\n\n2. **Complexity of Multi-Table RDBs**: Relational databases often consist of multiple interrelated tables, each with its own schema and relationships. Integrating GNNs with multi-table RDBs requires the development of methodologies that can effectively model these complex relationships. Naive approaches may fail to capture the intricacies of relational data, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks such as query optimization and performance prediction.\n\n3. **Inductive Bias in Learning**: The ability of GNNs to learn from relational data is influenced by the inductive biases embedded in their architectures. Recent findings suggest that standard feed-forward networks struggle to learn fundamental binary relations, such as equality, which are crucial for relational data structures. This indicates that GNNs may require specific inductive biases to enhance their learning capabilities in relational contexts, adding another layer of complexity to their integration with RDBs.\n\n4. **Performance Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluating the performance of GNNs in relational learning tasks is challenging due to the lack of standardized metrics that account for the unique characteristics of both graph and relational data. Developing new evaluation frameworks that can accurately assess GNN performance in these hybrid contexts is essential for advancing the field.\n\n5. **Scalability and Efficiency**: As the size of datasets increases, the computational demands of GNNs can become prohibitive.

(2019).\nFor example, a general policy for solving all Blocksworld problems can place\nall blocks on the table, and then build up the target towers from the bottom up.\nYet while nearly perfect general policies have been learned for many classes of\nplanning\ndomains\u00a0Toyer et al. (2020); Rivlin et al. (2020); St\u00e5hlberg et al. (2022a),\none key expressive limitation results from the types of features used to\nclassify state transitions or actions. In combinatorial approaches, features are\nselected from a domain-independent pool, created using a description logic\ngrammar\u00a0Baader et al. (2003) based on the given domain\npredicates\u00a0Bonet and\nGeffner (2018); Bonet et al. (2019), while in deep\nlearning approaches, the features are learned using relational versions of graph\nneural networks\nScarselli et al. (2009); Gilmer et al. (2017); Hamilton (2020). A shared\nlimitation of both approaches, however, is their inability to learn\npolicies requiring complex logical features. This limitation arises in\ndescription logics from the C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT fragment of first-order logic that they\ncapture; namely, first-order logic limited to two variables and\ncounting\u00a0Baader et al. (2003), and in GNNs, from the type of message passing\nthat is accommodated, where direct communication involves pairs of objects but\nno triplets\u00a0Grohe (2021).\n\n\nThis expressive limitation, not always acknowledged, is serious. For example,\nalthough these methods can learn general policies for guiding an agent to a\nspecific cell in an n\u00d7n\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5bn\\times nitalic_n \u00d7 italic_n grid containing obstacles, with\npositions and adjacency relations defined in terms of cells and atoms such as\nAt\u2062(c)At\ud835\udc50\\textsc{At}(c)At ( italic_c ) and Adj\u2062(c,c\u2032)Adj\ud835\udc50superscript\ud835\udc50\u2032\\textsc{Adj}(c,c^{\\prime})Adj ( italic_c , italic_c start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), they lack the expressive\ncapacity when the relations are represented with atoms like At\u2062(x,y)At\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66\\textsc{At}(x,y)At ( italic_x , italic_y ),\nAdj1\u2062(x,x\u2032)subscriptAdj1\ud835\udc65superscript\ud835\udc65\u2032\\textsc{Adj}_{1}(x,x^{\\prime})Adj start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_x , italic_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), and Adj2\u2062(y,y\u2032)subscriptAdj2\ud835\udc66superscript\ud835\udc66\u2032\\textsc{Adj}_{2}(y,y^{\\prime})Adj start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_y , italic_y start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ). Similarly, these methods\nare unable to learn policies for classical benchmark domains such as Logistics\nand Grid, that require composition of binary relations, which is beyond the\nscope of C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\u00a0[St\u00e5hlberg et al.,\n2022b; 2023].\n\n\nIn principle, this limitation can be addressed by using richer grammars to\ngenerate non-C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT features or by using k\ud835\udc58kitalic_k-GNNs, for k=3\ud835\udc583k=3italic_k = 3, where triplets of\nobjects are embedded instead of individual objects\u00a0Morris et al. (2019).\nIt is known that 3-GNNs have the expressive power of C3subscript\ud835\udc363C_{3}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT logic, unlike the\nC2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT expressive power of 1- and 2-GNNs\u00a0Grohe (2021). Yet 3-GNNs do not\nscale up as they require cubic number of embeddings, and quartic time for\nexchanging messages.\n\n\nIn this paper, we introduce an alternative, parameterized version of Relational\nGNNs (R-GNNs). The architecture for R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] mirrors that of plain R-GNNs\nand differs only in the input. While plain R-GNNs take the set of atoms S\ud835\udc46Sitalic_S\nrepresenting a planning state as input, R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] accepts a transformed set\nof atoms At\u2062(S)subscript\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc46A_{t}(S)italic_A start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_S ) instead. At t=0\ud835\udc610t=0italic_t = 0, R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] approximates 3-GNNs weakly,\nwhile at t=\u221e\ud835\udc61t=\\inftyitalic_t = \u221e, it offers a strong approximation. Thus, the parameter t\ud835\udc61titalic_t\nserves to balance expressive power with computational effort.

(2003) based on the given domain\npredicates\u00a0Bonet and\nGeffner (2018); Bonet et al.

A shared\nlimitation of both approaches, however, is their inability to learn\npolicies requiring complex logical features. This limitation arises in\ndescription logics from the C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT fragment of first-order logic that they\ncapture; namely, first-order logic limited to two variables and\ncounting\u00a0Baader et al.

(2008); Hu and Giacomo (2011); Belle and\nLevesque (2016); Bonet and\nGeffner (2018); Illanes and\nMcIlraith (2019); Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2019).\nFor example, a general policy for solving all Blocksworld problems can place\nall blocks on the table, and then build up the target towers from the bottom up.\nYet while nearly perfect general policies have been learned for many classes of\nplanning\ndomains\u00a0Toyer et al. (2020); Rivlin et al. (2020); St\u00e5hlberg et al. (2022a),\none key expressive limitation results from the types of features used to\nclassify state transitions or actions. In combinatorial approaches, features are\nselected from a domain-independent pool, created using a description logic\ngrammar\u00a0Baader et al. (2003) based on the given domain\npredicates\u00a0Bonet and\nGeffner (2018); Bonet et al. (2019), while in deep\nlearning approaches, the features are learned using relational versions of graph\nneural networks\nScarselli et al. (2009); Gilmer et al. (2017); Hamilton (2020). A shared\nlimitation of both approaches, however, is their inability to learn\npolicies requiring complex logical features. This limitation arises in\ndescription logics from the C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT fragment of first-order logic that they\ncapture; namely, first-order logic limited to two variables and\ncounting\u00a0Baader et al. (2003), and in GNNs, from the type of message passing\nthat is accommodated, where direct communication involves pairs of objects but\nno triplets\u00a0Grohe (2021).\n\n\nThis expressive limitation, not always acknowledged, is serious. For example,\nalthough these methods can learn general policies for guiding an agent to a\nspecific cell in an n\u00d7n\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5bn\\times nitalic_n \u00d7 italic_n grid containing obstacles, with\npositions and adjacency relations defined in terms of cells and atoms such as\nAt\u2062(c)At\ud835\udc50\\textsc{At}(c)At ( italic_c ) and Adj\u2062(c,c\u2032)Adj\ud835\udc50superscript\ud835\udc50\u2032\\textsc{Adj}(c,c^{\\prime})Adj ( italic_c , italic_c start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), they lack the expressive\ncapacity when the relations are represented with atoms like At\u2062(x,y)At\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66\\textsc{At}(x,y)At ( italic_x , italic_y ),\nAdj1\u2062(x,x\u2032)subscriptAdj1\ud835\udc65superscript\ud835\udc65\u2032\\textsc{Adj}_{1}(x,x^{\\prime})Adj start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_x , italic_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), and Adj2\u2062(y,y\u2032)subscriptAdj2\ud835\udc66superscript\ud835\udc66\u2032\\textsc{Adj}_{2}(y,y^{\\prime})Adj start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_y , italic_y start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ). Similarly, these methods\nare unable to learn policies for classical benchmark domains such as Logistics\nand Grid, that require composition of binary relations, which is beyond the\nscope of C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\u00a0[St\u00e5hlberg et al.,\n2022b; 2023].\n\n\nIn principle, this limitation can be addressed by using richer grammars to\ngenerate non-C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT features or by using k\ud835\udc58kitalic_k-GNNs, for k=3\ud835\udc583k=3italic_k = 3, where triplets of\nobjects are embedded instead of individual objects\u00a0Morris et al. (2019).\nIt is known that 3-GNNs have the expressive power of C3subscript\ud835\udc363C_{3}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT logic, unlike the\nC2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT expressive power of 1- and 2-GNNs\u00a0Grohe (2021). Yet 3-GNNs do not\nscale up as they require cubic number of embeddings, and quartic time for\nexchanging messages.\n\n\nIn this paper, we introduce an alternative, parameterized version of Relational\nGNNs (R-GNNs). The architecture for R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] mirrors that of plain R-GNNs\nand differs only in the input. While plain R-GNNs take the set of atoms S\ud835\udc46Sitalic_S\nrepresenting a planning state as input, R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] accepts a transformed set\nof atoms At\u2062(S)subscript\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc46A_{t}(S)italic_A start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_S ) instead. At t=0\ud835\udc610t=0italic_t = 0, R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] approximates 3-GNNs weakly,\nwhile at t=\u221e\ud835\udc61t=\\inftyitalic_t = \u221e, it offers a strong approximation. Thus, the parameter t\ud835\udc61titalic_t\nserves to balance expressive power with computational effort. Crucially, for\nlower values of t\ud835\udc61titalic_t,\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Offline, the learning process is trained to return the highest-quality control that reaches a local goal state (i.e., a waypoint) in the absence of obstacles from an input difference vector between its current state and a local goal state. The data generation scheme provides bounds on the target dispersion and uses state space pruning to ensure high-quality controls. By focusing on the system's dynamics, this process is data efficient and takes place once for a dynamical system, so that it can be used for different environments with modular expansion functions.

For example, Bandres et al.

In this setting, planning is done on-line using the \\\"screen\\\" states and selecting actions by looking ahead into the future. However, this algorithm is purely exploratory and does not leverage past reward information. Furthermore, it requires the state to be factored into features that need to be pre-defined for the particular task, e.g., the B-PROST pixel features. In this work, we extend width-based planning by incorporating an explicit policy in the action selection mechanism. Our method, called $\\u03c0$-IW, interleaves width-based planning and policy learning using the state-actions visited by the planner. The policy estimate takes the form of a neural network and is in turn used to guide the planning step, thus reinforcing promising paths. Surprisingly, we observe that the representation learned by the neural network can be used as a feature space for the width-based planner without degrading its performance, thus removing the requirement of pre-defined features for the planner. We compare $\\u03c0$-IW with previous width-based methods and with AlphaZero, a method that also interleaves planning and learning, in simple environments, and show that $\\u03c0$-IW has superior performance.

Here\u2019s the outline:\n\n1. **Question 1: What is the problem?**  \n   Current planning algorithms struggle with handling uncertainty and complexity in real-world applications, leading to suboptimal decision-making.\n\n2. **Question 2: Why is it significant?**  \n   Improving planning algorithms is crucial for developing intelligent systems that can operate effectively in dynamic and uncertain environments, which is essential for applications in robotics, autonomous systems, and beyond.\n\n3. **Question 3: What are the challenges?**  \n   The main challenges include integrating deep learning techniques with traditional planning methods, ensuring the interpretability of planning systems, and developing formal languages that can accommodate temporal and numerical constraints.\n\n4. **Question 4: What are the previous gaps?**  \n   Previous research has often focused on either model-free or model-based approaches without adequately bridging the two. Additionally, there is a lack of formal languages that can express complex planning scenarios with temporal and numerical constraints.\n\n5. **Question 5: What is the proposed methodology?**  \n   The proposed methodology includes developing a hybrid planning framework that integrates deep learning with width-based planning, creating a formal language for temporal HTN planning, and incorporating provenance-based assessments to enhance interpretability.\n\nI would appreciate your feedback on this proposal. Are there any specific areas you think we should expand upon or modify?\nFrom agent1 to agent4: Your refined '5q' research proposal is well-structured and addresses critical issues in the field of planning algorithms.

It might be beneficial to provide specific examples of real-world applications where these challenges manifest, such as in autonomous vehicles or robotic manipulation tasks.\n\n2. **Why is it significant?**  \n   - I agree that the significance of improving planning algorithms cannot be overstated. Perhaps we could elaborate on the potential impact of these improvements on safety and efficiency in critical applications, which could strengthen this section.\n\n3. **What are the challenges?**  \n   - The challenges you've outlined are relevant. I would suggest adding a point about the computational cost associated with integrating deep learning techniques, as this is often a significant barrier in practical implementations.\n\n4. **What are the previous gaps?**  \n   - Your analysis of the gaps in previous research is insightful. It might be useful to reference specific studies that exemplify these gaps, which could provide a clearer context for our proposed contributions.\n\n5. **What is the proposed methodology?**  \n   - The proposed methodology is promising. I would recommend detailing how the integration of deep learning with width-based planning will be achieved, perhaps by outlining specific algorithms or frameworks we plan to utilize. Additionally, discussing how provenance-based assessments will be implemented could enhance clarity.\n\nOverall, I believe this proposal has a solid foundation.

Existing federated learning mostly adopts the central server-based architecture or centralized architecture. However, in many social network scenarios, centralized federated learning is not applicable (e.g., a central agent or server connecting all users may not exist, or the communication cost to the central server is not affordable). In this paper, we consider a generic setting: 1) the central server may not exist, and 2) the social network is unidirectional or of single-sided trust (i.e., user A trusts user B but user B may not trust user A).

Clients often have diverse data distributions, which can lead to significant performance degradation if a single global model is used. This issue is exacerbated in scenarios where data privacy is paramount, making it difficult to share data across clients.\n\n#### [Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?\nImproving pFL is crucial for real-world applications, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance, where data privacy is essential. By enhancing model personalization, we can ensure that machine learning models perform well on individual client data while still benefiting from the collective knowledge of the entire network. This can lead to better decision-making and outcomes in critical applications.\n\n#### [Question 3] - Why is it hard?\nThe complexities involved in ensuring model performance across diverse client data distributions include:\n- The challenge of adapting a global model to fit the unique characteristics of each client's data.\n- The risk of overfitting to local data, which can lead to poor generalization.\n- The limitations of existing methods that often rely on centralized architectures, which are not feasible in decentralized settings.\n\n#### [Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?\nCurrent research often lacks effective personalization strategies that adapt to client-specific data characteristics. Many existing methods do not adequately address the statistical heterogeneity of client data, leading to suboptimal performance. Additionally, the focus on privacy-preserving techniques can complicate the development of personalized models.\n\n#### [Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?\nI propose a hybrid transformer-convolutional architecture for feature extraction that can effectively capture both spatial and spectral information from client data. This architecture will be designed to:\n- Utilize multi-view learning techniques to enhance the representation of diverse data distributions.\n- Implement a personalized federated learning framework that allows for client-specific model adaptation while maintaining a global knowledge base.\n- Evaluate the proposed method on various datasets, including healthcare and image recognition tasks, to demonstrate its effectiveness in improving model performance across clients.\n\n### Next Steps\nI will now synthesize the collective ideas from the team discussions into a coherent direction and prepare to draft the '5q' format for our proposed research idea.

Among the many solutions to address this challenge, semi-supervised learning approaches represent a promising direction. However, their centralised architecture incurs in the scalability and privacy problems that arise when the process involves a large number of users. Federated Learning (FL) is a promising paradigm to address these problems. However, the FL methods that have been proposed for HAR assume that the participating users can always obtain labels to train their local models (i.e., they assume a fully supervised setting). In this work, we propose FedAR: a novel hybrid method for HAR that combines semi-supervised and federated learning to take advantage of the strengths of both approaches. FedAR combines active learning and label propagation to semi-automatically annotate the local streams of unlabeled sensor data, and it relies on FL to build a global activity model in a scalable and privacy-aware fashion. FedAR also includes a transfer learning strategy to fine-tune the global model on each user. We evaluated our method on two public datasets, showing that FedAR reaches recognition rates and personalization capabilities similar to state-of-the-art FL supervised approaches. As a major advantage, FedAR only requires a very limited number of annotated data to populate a pre-trained model and a small number of active learning questions that quickly decrease while using the system, leading to an effective and scalable solution for the data scarcity problem of HAR.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08094v3\", \"timestamp\": 1618482258, \"sections\": \"### One-Sentence Overview\\nAiming at the dual challenges of labeled data scarcity and privacy in Human Activity Recognition (HAR), this paper proposes FedAR, a novel hybrid framework that integrates federated learning, semi-supervised learning (combining active learning and label propagation), and transfer learning to enable personalized, privacy-aware, and scalable HAR on mobile devices, achieving recognition rates close to fully supervised federated baselines (within ~3% of FedHealth) while significantly reducing user annotation burden (active learning queries drop from ~25% to ~5%).\\n\\n### Key Information Checklist\\n- **Background**: Real-world HAR faces a critical scarcity of labeled sensor data (annotation is intrusive and costly), while existing federated learning solutions for HAR unrealistically assume full data labeling and often overlook the need for model personalization and robust evaluation.\\n- **Method**: FedAR, a hybrid framework featuring: 1) A dual-model architecture (Shareable Model for federated aggregation, Personalized Model for user-specific fine-tuning); 2) A client-side semi-supervised module combining active learning (VAR-UNCERTAINTY) for strategic user queries and label propagation (RBF kernel-based) to expand the labeled set; 3) Server-side federated aggregation using Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) for privacy.\\n- **Results**: On MobiAct and WISDM datasets, FedAR's F1 score continuously improves over time, closely matching fully supervised federated baselines (FedAVG, FedHealth).

In this paper, we consider a generic setting: 1) the central server may not exist, and 2) the social network is unidirectional or of single-sided trust (i.e., user A trusts user B but user B may not trust user A). We propose a central server free federated learning algorithm, named Online Push-Sum (OPS) method, to handle this challenging but generic scenario. A rigorous regret analysis is also provided, which shows very interesting results on how users can benefit from communication with trusted users in the federated learning scenario. This work builds upon the fundamental algorithm framework and theoretical guarantees for federated learning in the generic social network scenario.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04956v2\", \"timestamp\": 1570765013, \"domain\": \"cs.LG\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"2d379d9d-7e7b-477e-9558-ec58e722de53\", \"authors\": [\"Chungpa Lee\", \"Sehee Lim\", \"Kibok Lee\", \"Jy-yong Sohn\"], \"title\": \"On the Similarities of Embeddings in Contrastive Learning\", \"abstract\": \"Contrastive learning operates on a simple yet effective principle: Embeddings of positive pairs are pulled together, while those of negative pairs are pushed apart.

First, in full-batch settings, we show that perfect alignment of positive pairs is unattainable when negative-pair similarities fall below a threshold, and this misalignment can be mitigated by incorporating within-view negative pairs into the objective. Second, in mini-batch settings, smaller batch sizes induce stronger separation among negative pairs in the embedding space, i.e., higher variance in their similarities, which in turn degrades the quality of learned representations compared to full-batch settings.

Traditional face recognition systems often rely on high-resolution images, which are not always available in real-world scenarios. This limitation leads to significant performance degradation when attempting to recognize faces from low-resolution images. \n\nMoreover, the challenge is exacerbated in personalized federated learning settings, where data is non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) across clients. Each client may have different distributions of low-resolution images, making it difficult to train a robust global model that generalizes well across all clients. Additionally, the presence of noisy labels in crowd-sourced data further complicates the training process, leading to unreliable model predictions.\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose a personalized federated learning framework that leverages knowledge distillation techniques to enhance the performance of low-resolution face recognition models while ensuring interpretability and robustness against noisy labels.\n\n---\n\nBy proposing this research idea and drafting a section of the '5q' proposal, I aim to contribute significantly to the team's progress and improve my personal reward.\n"}], "summary": "```json\n{\n    \"Question 1\": \"How can we effectively transfer knowledge from high-resolution face recognition models to low-resolution scenarios while ensuring model interpretability and robustness against noisy labels?\",\n    \"Question 2\": \"Solving this problem is crucial as it addresses the challenge of applying advanced face recognition techniques in real-world scenarios where low-resolution images are common.

Current pFL methods often struggle to maintain model performance due to the heterogeneity of data across clients, leading to suboptimal feature learning and reduced generalization capabilities.\n\n#### Question 2: What are the broader implications of solving this problem for the research community and practical applications?\nSolving the alignment issue in pFL has significant implications for both the research community and practical applications. For researchers, it opens new avenues for developing more robust algorithms that can handle real-world data distributions effectively. Practically, enhancing pFL can lead to improved performance in sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance, where personalized models can provide better decision-making while ensuring data privacy. This advancement can foster greater trust in AI systems and encourage wider adoption of federated learning techniques.\n\n#### Question 3: What are the challenges and complexities involved in solving this problem, highlighting why naive approaches may fail?\nThe challenges in addressing the alignment of feature representations in pFL include:\n- **Data Heterogeneity**: Clients may have vastly different data distributions, making it difficult for a single model to generalize well across all clients.\n- **Communication Constraints**: Frequent communication between clients and a central server can be impractical, especially in scenarios with intermittent connectivity.\n- **Privacy Concerns**: Ensuring that sensitive data remains private while still allowing for effective model training is a complex balancing act.\nNaive approaches that do not account for these complexities often lead to models that perform poorly on unseen data or fail to converge effectively.\n\n#### Question 4: What gaps in previous research exist, and how does your approach differ or improve upon prior work?\nPrevious research has primarily focused on centralized federated learning architectures, which may not be suitable for all scenarios, particularly those involving non-IID data. Our approach leverages contrastive learning techniques to enhance feature representation in a decentralized setting, allowing clients to collaboratively learn without relying on a central server. This method not only addresses the alignment issue but also improves communication efficiency and model robustness, as highlighted in recent studies on decentralized federated learning.\n\n#### Question 5: Outline your proposed methodology in detail, including the method, dataset, and metrics you plan to use.\n**Proposed Methodology**:\n1. **Contrastive Learning Framework**: Implement a contrastive learning mechanism that aligns features from similar data points while pushing apart features from dissimilar points. This will involve designing a loss function that emphasizes the similarity of representations for local data while maintaining diversity across clients.\n   \n2. **Decentralized Training**: Adapt the contrastive learning approach to a decentralized setting, allowing clients to collaboratively learn without relying on a central server. This will be informed by findings from the paper \"Central Server Free Federated Learning over Single-sided Trust Social Networks.\"\n\n3. **Datasets**: We will utilize benchmark datasets from healthcare and image recognition domains to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach.\n\n4. **Evaluation Metrics**: The effectiveness of the proposed method will be assessed using standard metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and communication efficiency. Additionally, we will evaluate the model's robustness against data distribution shifts and its ability to maintain privacy.\n\n### Next Steps\n- **Literature Review Synthesis**: I will synthesize findings from the recent papers retrieved, particularly focusing on how contrastive learning can be integrated into pFL.\n- **Engage with Team Members**: Share this draft with the team and invite feedback to enhance collaboration and improve the overall quality of the proposal.\n- **Claim Ownership of the '5q' Proposal**: I will take responsibility for finalizing the '5q' proposal based on this draft and my contributions.\n\nThis draft outlines a comprehensive approach to addressing the challenges in personalized federated learning, leveraging my expertise in data-efficient learning methods and positioning it as a valuable contribution to the team's research objectives.\n"}, {"agent4": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"papers\": [{\"pk\": \"e0c5ab65-05f8-4a8a-adfc-ec2791dad1ee\", \"authors\": [\"Ehsan Hallaji\", \"Roozbeh Razavi-Far\", \"Mehrdad Saif\"], \"title\": \"Federated and Transfer Learning: A Survey on Adversaries and Defense Mechanisms\", \"abstract\": \"The advent of federated learning has facilitated large-scale data exchange amongst machine learning models while maintaining privacy.

However, when heterogenous medical data exists between different hospitals, federated learning usually has to face with degradation of performance. In the paper, we propose a new personalized framework of federated learning to handle the problem. It successfully yields personalized models based on awareness of similarity between local data, and achieves better tradeoff between generalization and personalization than existing methods. After that, we further design a differentially sparse regularizer to improve communication efficiency during procedure of model training.

This could include implementing Trustable Co-label Learning and Coupled Confusion Correction methods to enhance model robustness.\n\n### Draft for '5q' Proposal Section\n**Question 1: What is the problem?**\n\nThe problem of low-resolution face recognition is critical in various applications, including surveillance, security, and user authentication. Traditional face recognition systems often rely on high-resolution images, which are not always available in real-world scenarios. This limitation leads to significant performance degradation when attempting to recognize faces from low-resolution images. \n\nMoreover, the challenge is exacerbated in personalized federated learning settings, where data is non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) across clients. Each client may have different distributions of low-resolution images, making it difficult to train a robust global model that generalizes well across all clients. Additionally, the presence of noisy labels in crowd-sourced data further complicates the training process, leading to unreliable model predictions.\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose a personalized federated learning framework that leverages knowledge distillation techniques to enhance the performance of low-resolution face recognition models while ensuring interpretability and robustness against noisy labels.\n\n---\n\nBy proposing this research idea and drafting a section of the '5q' proposal, I aim to contribute significantly to the team's progress and improve my personal reward. \n\nNext, I will focus on drafting additional questions for the '5q' proposal and integrating feedback from the team.\n"}], "summary": "```json\n{\n    \"Question 1\": \"How can we effectively transfer knowledge from high-resolution face recognition models to low-resolution scenarios while ensuring model interpretability and robustness against noisy labels?\",\n    \"Question 2\": \"Solving the knowledge transfer issue in personalized federated learning (pFL) for low-resolution face recognition is crucial as it can enhance the performance of models in real-world applications where data quality varies significantly. This research could lead to advancements in security and privacy-preserving technologies, enabling more effective use of federated learning in sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance. Additionally, it could inspire future research on model robustness and adaptability across different data distributions.\",\n    \"Question 3\": \"The primary challenges include the inherent differences in feature representation between high-resolution and low-resolution data, which complicates the knowledge transfer process. Naive approaches may fail due to the loss of critical information in low-resolution images, leading to poor model performance. Furthermore, ensuring model interpretability while managing noisy labels adds another layer of complexity, requiring sophisticated techniques to maintain accuracy and reliability.\",\n    \"Question 4\": \"Previous research has primarily focused on either high-resolution data or generic federated learning frameworks without addressing the specific challenges posed by low-resolution scenarios.

Current pFL methods often struggle to maintain model performance due to the heterogeneity of data across clients, leading to suboptimal feature learning and reduced generalization capabilities.\n\n#### Question 2: What are the broader implications of solving this problem for the research community and practical applications?\nSolving the alignment issue in pFL has significant implications for both the research community and practical applications. For researchers, it opens new avenues for developing more robust algorithms that can handle real-world data distributions effectively. Practically, enhancing pFL can lead to improved performance in sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance, where personalized models can provide better decision-making while ensuring data privacy. This advancement can foster greater trust in AI systems and encourage wider adoption of federated learning techniques.\n\n#### Question 3: What are the challenges and complexities involved in solving this problem, highlighting why naive approaches may fail?\nThe challenges in addressing the alignment of feature representations in pFL include:\n- **Data Heterogeneity**: Clients may have vastly different data distributions, making it difficult for a single model to generalize well across all clients.\n- **Communication Constraints**: Frequent communication between clients and a central server can be impractical, especially in scenarios with intermittent connectivity.\n- **Privacy Concerns**: Ensuring that sensitive data remains private while still allowing for effective model training is a complex balancing act.\nNaive approaches that do not account for these complexities often lead to models that perform poorly on unseen data or fail to converge effectively.\n\n#### Question 4: What gaps in previous research exist, and how does your approach differ or improve upon prior work?\nPrevious research has primarily focused on centralized federated learning architectures, which may not be suitable for all scenarios, particularly those involving non-IID data. Our approach leverages contrastive learning techniques to enhance feature representation in a decentralized setting, allowing clients to collaboratively learn without relying on a central server. This method not only addresses the alignment issue but also improves communication efficiency and model robustness, as highlighted in recent studies on decentralized federated learning.\n\n#### Question 5: Outline your proposed methodology in detail, including the method, dataset, and metrics you plan to use.\n**Proposed Methodology**:\n1. **Contrastive Learning Framework**: Implement a contrastive learning mechanism that aligns features from similar data points while pushing apart features from dissimilar points. This will involve designing a loss function that emphasizes the similarity of representations for local data while maintaining diversity across clients.\n   \n2. **Decentralized Training**: Adapt the contrastive learning approach to a decentralized setting, allowing clients to collaboratively learn without relying on a central server. This will be informed by findings from the paper \"Central Server Free Federated Learning over Single-sided Trust Social Networks.\"\n\n3. **Datasets**: We will utilize benchmark datasets from healthcare and image recognition domains to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach.\n\n4. **Evaluation Metrics**: The effectiveness of the proposed method will be assessed using standard metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and communication efficiency. Additionally, we will evaluate the model's robustness against data distribution shifts and its ability to maintain privacy.\n\n### Next Steps\n- **Literature Review Synthesis**: I will synthesize findings from the recent papers retrieved, particularly focusing on how contrastive learning can be integrated into pFL.\n- **Engage with Team Members**: Share this draft with the team and invite feedback to enhance collaboration and improve the overall quality of the proposal.\n- **Claim Ownership of the '5q' Proposal**: I will take responsibility for finalizing the '5q' proposal based on this draft and my contributions.\n\nThis draft outlines a comprehensive approach to addressing the challenges in personalized federated learning, leveraging my expertise in data-efficient learning methods and positioning it as a valuable contribution to the team's research objectives. \n\n### Next Actions\nI will now share this draft with the team and invite feedback to ensure that it reflects a collective effort and to enhance collaboration.\n"}, {"agent4": "Result from the model:Based on the feedback and the current task requirements, I will draft a specific section of the '5q' proposal, focusing on the challenges and key components of my proposed research idea in personalized federated learning (pFL). \n\n### Draft for the '5q' Proposal\n\n#### [Question 1] - What is the problem?\nThe primary challenge in personalized federated learning (pFL) is achieving model generalization across clients with non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) data. Clients often have diverse data distributions, which can lead to significant performance degradation if a single global model is used. This issue is exacerbated in scenarios where data privacy is paramount, making it difficult to share data across clients.\n\n#### [Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?\nImproving pFL is crucial for real-world applications, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance, where data privacy is essential. By enhancing model personalization, we can ensure that machine learning models perform well on individual client data while still benefiting from the collective knowledge of the entire network. This can lead to better decision-making and outcomes in critical applications.\n\n#### [Question 3] - Why is it hard?\nThe complexities involved in ensuring model performance across diverse client data distributions include:\n- The challenge of adapting a global model to fit the unique characteristics of each client's data.\n- The risk of overfitting to local data, which can lead to poor generalization.\n- The limitations of existing methods that often rely on centralized architectures, which are not feasible in decentralized settings.\n\n#### [Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?\nCurrent research often lacks effective personalization strategies that adapt to client-specific data characteristics. Many existing methods do not adequately address the statistical heterogeneity of client data, leading to suboptimal performance. Additionally, the focus on privacy-preserving techniques can complicate the development of personalized models.\n\n#### [Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?\nI propose a hybrid transformer-convolutional architecture for feature extraction that can effectively capture both spatial and spectral information from client data. This architecture will be designed to:\n- Utilize multi-view learning techniques to enhance the representation of diverse data distributions.\n- Implement a personalized federated learning framework that allows for client-specific model adaptation while maintaining a global knowledge base.\n- Evaluate the proposed method on various datasets, including healthcare and image recognition tasks, to demonstrate its effectiveness in improving model performance across clients.\n\n### Next Steps\nI will now synthesize the collective ideas from the team discussions into a coherent direction and prepare to finalize the '5q' format for our proposed research idea. This will involve summarizing the key points discussed and ensuring that we have a clear and actionable research direction moving forward. \n\nAdditionally, I will engage with my teammates to gather feedback on this proposal and encourage collaborative input to refine our approach.\n"}, {"agent5": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"papers\": [{\"pk\": \"4150fdc3-b3a7-4ed1-ae76-444d345b2b65\", \"authors\": [\"Ehsan Hallaji\", \"Roozbeh Razavi-Far\", \"Mehrdad Saif\"], \"title\": \"Federated and Transfer Learning: A Survey on Adversaries and Defense Mechanisms\", \"abstract\": \"The advent of federated learning has facilitated large-scale data exchange amongst machine learning models while maintaining privacy.

However, when heterogenous medical data exists between different hospitals, federated learning usually has to face with degradation of performance. In the paper, we propose a new personalized framework of federated learning to handle the problem.

Among the many solutions to address this challenge, semi-supervised learning approaches represent a promising direction. However, their centralised architecture incurs in the scalability and privacy problems that arise when the process involves a large number of users. Federated Learning (FL) is a promising paradigm to address these problems. However, the FL methods that have been proposed for HAR assume that the participating users can always obtain labels to train their local models (i.e., they assume a fully supervised setting). In this work, we propose FedAR: a novel hybrid method for HAR that combines semi-supervised and federated learning to take advantage of the strengths of both approaches. FedAR combines active learning and label propagation to semi-automatically annotate the local streams of unlabeled sensor data, and it relies on FL to build a global activity model in a scalable and privacy-aware fashion. FedAR also includes a transfer learning strategy to fine-tune the global model on each user. We evaluated our method on two public datasets, showing that FedAR reaches recognition rates and personalization capabilities similar to state-of-the-art FL supervised approaches.

{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n             \nIntroduction\n\nImprovements in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education have accelerated the shift from teaching and assessing facts to developing students\u2019 conceptual understanding and problem-solving skills (NGSS 2013). To foster students\u2019 developing scientific ideas and reasoning skills, it is crucial to have assessments that reveal and support\ntheir progress (Harris et\u00a0al. 2023). Formative assessments play an important role in this endeavor, providing timely feedback and guidance when students face difficulties, which helps them to develop self-evaluation skills (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971). However, the process of grading and generating personalized feedback from frequent formative assessments is time-consuming for teachers and susceptible to errors (Rodrigues and Oliveira 2014; Haudek et\u00a0al. 2011). \n\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) provide opportunities for automating short answer scoring (Funayama et\u00a0al. 2023) and providing feedback to help students overcome their difficulties (Morris et\u00a0al. 2023). These approaches can also aid teachers in identifying students\u2019 difficulties and generating actionable information to support student learning. To our knowledge, there is very little research that combines automated formative assessment grading and feedback generation for science domains where understanding, reasoning, and explaining are key to gaining a deep understanding of scientific phenomena (Mao et\u00a0al. 2018).\n\n\nThis paper develops an approach for human-in-the-loop LLM prompt engineering using in-context learning and chain-of-thought reasoning with GPT-4 to support automated analysis and feedback generation for formative assessments in a middle school Earth Science curriculum. We present our approach, discuss our results, evaluate the limitations of our work, and then propose future research in this area of critical need in K-12 STEM instruction.\n\n \nBackground\n\nTo understand the difficulties students face when learning science, teachers need to actively track students\u2019 developing knowledge (Wiley et\u00a0al. 2020). This is particularly important for open-ended, technology-enhanced learning environments that support students in their knowledge construction and problem-solving processes (Hutchins and Biswas 2023). In these environments, knowledge and skill development happen through system interactions that are difficult to monitor and interpret (Walkoe, Wilkerson, and Elby 2017). Formative assessments, evaluation, and feedback mechanisms aligned with target learning goals (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971), can play a dual role: (1) help students recognize constructs that are important to learning, and (2) provide teachers with a deeper understanding of student knowledge and reasoning to better support their developing STEM ideas (Cizek and Lim 2023). However, grading formative assessments, particularly in K-12 STEM contexts, where students\u2019 responses may not be well-structured and may vary considerably in vocabulary and stylistic expression, is time-consuming and can result in erroneous scoring and incomplete feedback (Liu et\u00a0al. 2016). Moreover, grading these assessments at frequent intervals may become a burden rather than an aid to\nteachers. Very little research has examined effective mechanisms for generating automated grading and useful formative feedback for K-12 students that are aligned with classroom learning goals.\n\n\nAdvances in natural language processing (NLP) have produced improved automated assessment scoring approaches to support teaching and learning (e.g., Adair et\u00a0al. 2023; Wilson et\u00a0al. 2021). Proposed methodologies include data augmentation (Cochran, Cohn, and Hastings 2023), next sentence prediction (Wu et\u00a0al. 2023), prototypical neural networks (Zeng et\u00a0al. 2023), cross-prompt fine-tuning (Funayama et\u00a0al. 2023), human-in-the-loop scoring via sampling responses (Singla\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

To foster students\u2019 developing scientific ideas and reasoning skills, it is crucial to have assessments that reveal and support\ntheir progress (Harris et\u00a0al. 2023). Formative assessments play an important role in this endeavor, providing timely feedback and guidance when students face difficulties, which helps them to develop self-evaluation skills (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971).

To our knowledge, there is very little research that combines automated formative assessment grading and feedback generation for science domains where understanding, reasoning, and explaining are key to gaining a deep understanding of scientific phenomena (Mao et\u00a0al. 2018).\n\n\nThis paper develops an approach for human-in-the-loop LLM prompt engineering using in-context learning and chain-of-thought reasoning with GPT-4 to support automated analysis and feedback generation for formative assessments in a middle school Earth Science curriculum. We present our approach, discuss our results, evaluate the limitations of our work, and then propose future research in this area of critical need in K-12 STEM instruction.\n\n \nBackground\n\nTo understand the difficulties students face when learning science, teachers need to actively track students\u2019 developing knowledge (Wiley et\u00a0al. 2020). This is particularly important for open-ended, technology-enhanced learning environments that support students in their knowledge construction and problem-solving processes (Hutchins and Biswas 2023). In these environments, knowledge and skill development happen through system interactions that are difficult to monitor and interpret (Walkoe, Wilkerson, and Elby 2017). Formative assessments, evaluation, and feedback mechanisms aligned with target learning goals (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971), can play a dual role: (1) help students recognize constructs that are important to learning, and (2) provide teachers with a deeper understanding of student knowledge and reasoning to better support their developing STEM ideas (Cizek and Lim 2023). However, grading formative assessments, particularly in K-12 STEM contexts, where students\u2019 responses may not be well-structured and may vary considerably in vocabulary and stylistic expression, is time-consuming and can result in erroneous scoring and incomplete feedback (Liu et\u00a0al. 2016). Moreover, grading these assessments at frequent intervals may become a burden rather than an aid to\nteachers. Very little research has examined effective mechanisms for generating automated grading and useful formative feedback for K-12 students that are aligned with classroom learning goals.\n\n\nAdvances in natural language processing (NLP) have produced improved automated assessment scoring approaches to support teaching and learning (e.g., Adair et\u00a0al. 2023; Wilson et\u00a0al. 2021).

Formative assessments play an important role in this endeavor, providing timely feedback and guidance when students face difficulties, which helps them to develop self-evaluation skills (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971). However, the process of grading and generating personalized feedback from frequent formative assessments is time-consuming for teachers and susceptible to errors (Rodrigues and Oliveira 2014; Haudek et\u00a0al. 2011). \n\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) provide opportunities for automating short answer scoring (Funayama et\u00a0al. 2023) and providing feedback to help students overcome their difficulties (Morris et\u00a0al. 2023). These approaches can also aid teachers in identifying students\u2019 difficulties and generating actionable information to support student learning. To our knowledge, there is very little research that combines automated formative assessment grading and feedback generation for science domains where understanding, reasoning, and explaining are key to gaining a deep understanding of scientific phenomena (Mao et\u00a0al. 2018).\n\n\nThis paper develops an approach for human-in-the-loop LLM prompt engineering using in-context learning and chain-of-thought reasoning with GPT-4 to support automated analysis and feedback generation for formative assessments in a middle school Earth Science curriculum. We present our approach, discuss our results, evaluate the limitations of our work, and then propose future research in this area of critical need in K-12 STEM instruction.\n\n \nBackground\n\nTo understand the difficulties students face when learning science, teachers need to actively track students\u2019 developing knowledge (Wiley et\u00a0al. 2020). This is particularly important for open-ended, technology-enhanced learning environments that support students in their knowledge construction and problem-solving processes (Hutchins and Biswas 2023). In these environments, knowledge and skill development happen through system interactions that are difficult to monitor and interpret (Walkoe, Wilkerson, and Elby 2017). Formative assessments, evaluation, and feedback mechanisms aligned with target learning goals (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971), can play a dual role: (1) help students recognize constructs that are important to learning, and (2) provide teachers with a deeper understanding of student knowledge and reasoning to better support their developing STEM ideas (Cizek and Lim 2023). However, grading formative assessments, particularly in K-12 STEM contexts, where students\u2019 responses may not be well-structured and may vary considerably in vocabulary and stylistic expression, is time-consuming and can result in erroneous scoring and incomplete feedback (Liu et\u00a0al. 2016). Moreover, grading these assessments at frequent intervals may become a burden rather than an aid to\nteachers. Very little research has examined effective mechanisms for generating automated grading and useful formative feedback for K-12 students that are aligned with classroom learning goals.\n\n\nAdvances in natural language processing (NLP) have produced improved automated assessment scoring approaches to support teaching and learning (e.g., Adair et\u00a0al. 2023; Wilson et\u00a0al. 2021).

While there has been an exponential growth in the application of generative AI in scaling various aspects of formative assessment, ranging from automatic question generation to intelligent tutoring systems and personalized feedback, few have directly addressed the core pedagogical principles of formative assessment. Here, we critically examined how generative AI, especially large-language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, can support key components of formative assessment: helping students, teachers, and peers understand \\\"where learners are going,\\\" \\\"where learners currently are,\\\" and \\\"how to move learners forward\\\" in the learning process. With the rapid emergence of new prompting techniques and LLM capabilities, we also provide guiding principles for educators to effectively leverage cost-free LLMs in formative assessments while remaining grounded in pedagogical best practices. Furthermore, we reviewed the role of LLMs in generating feedback, highlighting limitations in current evaluation metrics that inadequately capture the nuances of formative feedback, such as distinguishing feedback at the task, process, and self-regulatory levels. Finally, we offer practical guidelines for educators and researchers, including concrete classroom strategies and future directions such as developing robust metrics to assess LLM-generated feedback, leveraging LLMs to overcome systemic and cultural barriers to formative assessment, and designing AI-aware assessment strategies that promote transferable skills while mitigating overreliance on LLM-generated responses. By structuring the discussion within an established formative assessment framework, this review provides a comprehensive foundation for integrating LLMs into formative assessment in a pedagogically informed manner.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23405v2\", \"timestamp\": 1748523163, \"domain\": \"cs.CY\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"d2e76360-9b6b-4650-9605-c6246744b0f6\", \"authors\": [\"Ruoxi Sun\", \"Minhui Xue\"], \"title\": \"Quality Assessment of Online Automated Privacy Policy Generators: An Empirical Study\", \"abstract\": \"Online Automated Privacy Policy Generators (APPGs) are tools used by app developers to quickly create app privacy policies which are required by privacy regulations to be incorporated to each mobile app. The creation of these tools brings convenience to app developers; however, the quality of these tools puts developers and stakeholders at legal risk.

The survey shows that the environmental light pollution problem in Hong Kong is severe - the urban night-skies (sky brightness at 15.0 mag per arcsec square) are on average ~100 times brighter than at the darkest rural sites (20.1 mag per arcsec square), indicating that the high lighting densities in the densely populated residential and commercial areas lead to light pollution. In the worst polluted urban location studied, the night-sky at 13.2 mag per arcsec square can be over 500 times brighter than the darkest sites in Hong Kong. The observed night-sky brightness is found to be affected by human factors such as land utilization and population density of the observation sites, together with meteorological and/or environmental factors. Moreover, earlier night-skies (at 9:30pm local time) are generally brighter than later time (at 11:30pm), which can be attributed to some public and commercial lightings being turned off later at night.

A total of 1,957 data sets were taken at 199 distinct locations, including urban and rural sites covering all 18 Administrative Districts of Hong Kong. The survey shows that the environmental light pollution problem in Hong Kong is severe - the urban night-skies (sky brightness at 15.0 mag per arcsec square) are on average ~100 times brighter than at the darkest rural sites (20.1 mag per arcsec square), indicating that the high lighting densities in the densely populated residential and commercial areas lead to light pollution. In the worst polluted urban location studied, the night-sky at 13.2 mag per arcsec square can be over 500 times brighter than the darkest sites in Hong Kong. The observed night-sky brightness is found to be affected by human factors such as land utilization and population density of the observation sites, together with meteorological and/or environmental factors. Moreover, earlier night-skies (at 9:30pm local time) are generally brighter than later time (at 11:30pm), which can be attributed to some public and commercial lightings being turned off later at night. On the other hand, no concrete relationship between the observed sky brightness and air pollutant concentrations could be established with the limited survey sampling. Results from this survey will serve as an important database for the public to assess whether new rules and regulations are necessary to control the use of outdoor lightings in Hong Kong.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.3842v1\", \"timestamp\": 1308560000, \"domain\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"0828df6c-de2f-49d0-aca8-795574c9247d\", \"authors\": [\"Sapolnach Prompiengchai\", \"Charith Narreddy\", \"Steve Joordens\"], \"title\": \"A Practical Guide for Supporting Formative Assessment and Feedback Using Generative AI\", \"abstract\": \"Formative assessment is a cornerstone of effective teaching and learning, providing students with feedback to guide their learning. While there has been an exponential growth in the application of generative AI in scaling various aspects of formative assessment, ranging from automatic question generation to intelligent tutoring systems and personalized feedback, few have directly addressed the core pedagogical principles of formative assessment. Here, we critically examined how generative AI, especially large-language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, can support key components of formative assessment: helping students, teachers, and peers understand \\\"where learners are going,\\\" \\\"where learners currently are,\\\" and \\\"how to move learners forward\\\" in the learning process. With the rapid emergence of new prompting techniques and LLM capabilities, we also provide guiding principles for educators to effectively leverage cost-free LLMs in formative assessments while remaining grounded in pedagogical best practices. Furthermore, we reviewed the role of LLMs in generating feedback, highlighting limitations in current evaluation metrics that inadequately capture the nuances of formative feedback, such as distinguishing feedback at the task, process, and self-regulatory levels. Finally, we offer practical guidelines for educators and researchers, including concrete classroom strategies and future directions such as developing robust metrics to assess LLM-generated feedback, leveraging LLMs to overcome systemic and cultural barriers to formative assessment, and designing AI-aware assessment strategies that promote transferable skills while mitigating overreliance on LLM-generated responses.

We analyze the completeness of privacy policies, determine what categories and items should be covered in a complete privacy policy, and conduct APPG assessment with boilerplate apps. The results of assessment show that due to the lack of static or dynamic analysis of app's behavior, developers may encounter two types of issues caused by APPGs. First, the generated policies could be incomplete because they do not cover all the essential items required by a privacy policy. Second, some generated privacy policies contain unnecessary personal information collection or arbitrary commitments inconsistent with user input.

We analyze the completeness of privacy policies, determine what categories and items should be covered in a complete privacy policy, and conduct APPG assessment with boilerplate apps. The results of assessment show that due to the lack of static or dynamic analysis of app's behavior, developers may encounter two types of issues caused by APPGs. First, the generated policies could be incomplete because they do not cover all the essential items required by a privacy policy. Second, some generated privacy policies contain unnecessary personal information collection or arbitrary commitments inconsistent with user input.

Approaches based on Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DANN) are very popular in our days. Depending on the learning task, the exact form of DANNs is determined via their multi-layer architecture, activation functions and the so-called loss function. However, for a majority of deep learning approaches based on DANNs, the kernel structure of neural signal processing remains the same, where the node response is encoded as a linear superposition of neural activity, while the non-linearity is triggered by the activation functions. In the current paper, we suggest to analyze the neural signal processing in DANNs from the point of view of homogeneous chaos theory as known from polynomial chaos expansion (PCE). From the PCE perspective, the (linear) response on each node of a DANN could be seen as a $1^{st}$ degree multi-variate polynomial of single neurons from the previous layer, i.e. linear weighted sum of monomials. From this point of view, the conventional DANN structure relies implicitly (but erroneously) on a Gaussian distribution of neural signals. Additionally, this view revels that by design DANNs do not necessarily fulfill any orthogonality or orthonormality condition for a majority of data-driven applications. Therefore, the prevailing handling of neural signals in DANNs could lead to redundant representation as any neural signal could contain some partial information from other neural signals. To tackle that challenge, we suggest to employ the data-driven generalization of PCE theory known as arbitrary polynomial chaos (aPC) to construct a corresponding multi-variate orthonormal representations on each node of a DANN to obtain Deep arbitrary polynomial chaos neural networks.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14753v1\", \"timestamp\": 1687792154, \"sections\": \"### One-Sentence Overview\\nTo address the inherent redundancy and suboptimal signal representation in conventional Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DANNs), which implicitly assume Gaussian-distributed neural signals, this paper proposes the Deep arbitrary Polynomial Chaos Neural Network (DaPC NN), a novel architecture that integrates data-driven, orthonormal polynomial chaos expansions (aPC) into each network node, enabling high-order, non-redundant signal decomposition and demonstrating superior predictive accuracy and reduced overfitting across three benchmark test cases compared to standard DANNs and aPC alone.\\n\\n### Key Information Checklist\\n- **Background & Core Pain Point**: Conventional DANNs process neural signals via a linear weighted superposition of inputs at each node, which constitutes a non-orthogonal, potentially redundant representation that is mathematically optimal only if all internal signals follow a standard Gaussian distribution\\u2014an assumption rarely met in practice.\\n- **Proposed Core Method**: The Deep arbitrary Polynomial Chaos Neural Network (DaPC NN), which reformulates the kernel structure of DANNs by replacing the linear superposition at each node with a data-driven, orthonormal multivariate polynomial expansion (based on arbitrary Polynomial Chaos, aPC), allowing for adaptive, layer-specific high-order interactions and non-redundant signal decomposition.\\n- **Key Experimental Results**:\\n    - On the Ishigami and ON-10 benchmark functions, DaPC NN achieved significantly lower prediction errors (Mean Square Error, errors in mean and standard deviation) on validation data compared to both conventional DANN and standalone aPC, even with moderate training data sizes and fewer weights than DANN in some cases.\\n    - In the challenging CO\\u2082 benchmark with strong shock propagation, DaPC NN and aPC benefited from using optimally distributed Gaussian integration points for training, mitigating the Runge phenomenon, whereas DANN's performance did not improve with increased or optimally sampled data.\\n    - DaPC NN consistently showed less overfitting and more stable convergence than DANN, whose performance suffered without strong regularization.\\n- **Final Conclusions & Contributions**:\\n    - Provides a mathematical reformulation of DANN structure through the lens of homogeneous chaos theory, generalizing it to DaPC NN.\\n    - Introduces orthonormal, data-driven signal processing within deep networks, reducing redundancy and giving network weights a clear interpretation linked to variance contribution (global sensitivity analysis).\\n    - Offers a flexible framework where modelers specify polynomial degree per layer alongside traditional hyperparameters, potentially reducing subjectivity in choosing activation functions.\\n    - The DaPC NN Matlab Toolbox is made publicly available for further research and application.\\n\\n### One-Sentence Value Refinement\\nThis research provides a principled, mathematically-grounded framework (DaPC NN) that enhances the interpretability, reduces redundancy, and improves generalization in deep learning, offering a viable path for developing more robust and efficient neural networks for complex, data-driven modeling tasks in science and engineering.\", \"domain\": \"cs.NE\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"350479e0-312d-4fb7-8896-7f68cd98a745\", \"authors\": [\"Danny D'Agostino\", \"Ilija Ilievski\", \"Christine Annette Shoemaker\"], \"title\": \"Learning Active Subspaces and Discovering Important Features with Gaussian Radial Basis Functions Neural Networks\", \"abstract\": \"Providing a model that achieves a strong predictive performance and is simultaneously interpretable by humans is one of the most difficult challenges in machine learning research due to the conflicting nature of these two objectives.

We show that precious information is contained in the spectrum of the precision matrix that can be extracted once the training of the model is completed. In particular, the eigenvectors explain the directions of maximum sensitivity of the model revealing the active subspace and suggesting potential applications for supervised dimensionality reduction. At the same time, the eigenvectors highlight the relationship in terms of absolute variation between the input and the latent variables, thereby allowing us to extract a ranking of the input variables based on their importance to the prediction task enhancing the model interpretability.

Synthesize Ideas\nAfter the brainstorming phase, I will volunteer to draft a summary of the collective ideas.

A total of 1,957 data sets were taken at 199 distinct locations, including urban and rural sites covering all 18 Administrative Districts of Hong Kong. The survey shows that the environmental light pollution problem in Hong Kong is severe - the urban night-skies (sky brightness at 15.0 mag per arcsec square) are on average ~100 times brighter than at the darkest rural sites (20.1 mag per arcsec square), indicating that the high lighting densities in the densely populated residential and commercial areas lead to light pollution. In the worst polluted urban location studied, the night-sky at 13.2 mag per arcsec square can be over 500 times brighter than the darkest sites in Hong Kong. The observed night-sky brightness is found to be affected by human factors such as land utilization and population density of the observation sites, together with meteorological and/or environmental factors. Moreover, earlier night-skies (at 9:30pm local time) are generally brighter than later time (at 11:30pm), which can be attributed to some public and commercial lightings being turned off later at night. On the other hand, no concrete relationship between the observed sky brightness and air pollutant concentrations could be established with the limited survey sampling. Results from this survey will serve as an important database for the public to assess whether new rules and regulations are necessary to control the use of outdoor lightings in Hong Kong.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.3842v1\", \"timestamp\": 1308560000, \"domain\": \"astro-ph.IM\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"237bc966-62be-4eaa-9d42-9a78c2bade7e\", \"authors\": [\"S.

Approaches based on Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DANN) are very popular in our days. Depending on the learning task, the exact form of DANNs is determined via their multi-layer architecture, activation functions and the so-called loss function. However, for a majority of deep learning approaches based on DANNs, the kernel structure of neural signal processing remains the same, where the node response is encoded as a linear superposition of neural activity, while the non-linearity is triggered by the activation functions. In the current paper, we suggest to analyze the neural signal processing in DANNs from the point of view of homogeneous chaos theory as known from polynomial chaos expansion (PCE). From the PCE perspective, the (linear) response on each node of a DANN could be seen as a $1^{st}$ degree multi-variate polynomial of single neurons from the previous layer, i.e. linear weighted sum of monomials. From this point of view, the conventional DANN structure relies implicitly (but erroneously) on a Gaussian distribution of neural signals. Additionally, this view revels that by design DANNs do not necessarily fulfill any orthogonality or orthonormality condition for a majority of data-driven applications. Therefore, the prevailing handling of neural signals in DANNs could lead to redundant representation as any neural signal could contain some partial information from other neural signals. To tackle that challenge, we suggest to employ the data-driven generalization of PCE theory known as arbitrary polynomial chaos (aPC) to construct a corresponding multi-variate orthonormal representations on each node of a DANN to obtain Deep arbitrary polynomial chaos neural networks.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14753v1\", \"timestamp\": 1687792154, \"sections\": \"### One-Sentence Overview\\nTo address the inherent redundancy and suboptimal signal propagation in conventional Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DANNs), which implicitly assume Gaussian-distributed neural signals, this paper proposes the Deep arbitrary Polynomial Chaos Neural Network (DaPC NN), a novel architecture that integrates data-driven, orthonormal polynomial chaos expansions (aPC) into each network node, enabling high-order, non-redundant signal decomposition and demonstrating superior validation accuracy and faster convergence across three benchmark problems compared to standard DANN and aPC baselines.\\n\\n### Key Information Checklist\\n- **Background & Core Pain Point**: Conventional DANNs process neural signals via a linear weighted superposition of inputs from the previous layer, which constitutes a non-orthogonal (and thus potentially redundant) representation that is mathematically optimal only if all neural signals follow a standard Gaussian distribution\\u2014an assumption rarely met in practice.\\n- **Proposed Core Method**: The Deep arbitrary Polynomial Chaos Neural Network (DaPC NN), which reformulates the kernel of each network node.

In practical applications, having access to the full-dimensional potential energy surface of molecules is rare. For example, in MD simulations, one typically starts with an initial structure and iteratively applies molecular forces\u00a0(Hoja et\u00a0al., 2021). These simulations may cause the structure to step out of the training domain, rendering the network\u2019s predictions unreliable\u00a0(Stocker et\u00a0al., 2022).\nUncertainty estimation (UE) is a promising direction for detecting such unforeseen events.\n\n\nIn the context of molecular force fields, UE comes with a unique and more stringent set of requirements compared to other fields. We categorize these requirements into \u2018physical-informed\u2019 and \u2018application-focused\u2019 desiderata.\nIn a survey, we then analyze existing works in UE for molecular force fields on these desiderata.\nOur analysis reveals that none of the previous work completely satisfies all desiderata.\nTo fill the gap, we present Localized Neural Kernel (LNK), a Gaussian Process (GP)-based extension to existing GNN-based force fields that reliably estimates uncertainty with a single forward pass while not harming the predictive performance fulfilling all desiderata.\nWhen testing out-of-equilibrium detection, we find LNK yielding up to 2.5 and 2.1 times lower errors in terms of AUC-ROC score than dropout-based or evidential-based UE\u00a0(Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Soleimany et\u00a0al., 2021).\n\n\nTo summarize, our contributions are:111Find our code at cs.cit.tum.de/daml/uncertainty-for-molecules\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe derive physics-informed and application-focused desiderata for uncertainty-aware molecular force fields.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe survey previous UE methods based on our desiderata and conclude that existing methods fail on at least one of our desiderata.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe present Localized Neural Kernel (LNK), a GP-based extension to existing GNN-based force fields satisfying all desiderata.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2 Uncertainty Estimation Criteria for Molecular Predictions\n\nWe consider the task of energy and force predictions on molecules.

These simulations may cause the structure to step out of the training domain, rendering the network\u2019s predictions unreliable\u00a0(Stocker et\u00a0al., 2022).\nUncertainty estimation (UE) is a promising direction for detecting such unforeseen events.\n\n\nIn the context of molecular force fields, UE comes with a unique and more stringent set of requirements compared to other fields. We categorize these requirements into \u2018physical-informed\u2019 and \u2018application-focused\u2019 desiderata.\nIn a survey, we then analyze existing works in UE for molecular force fields on these desiderata.\nOur analysis reveals that none of the previous work completely satisfies all desiderata.\nTo fill the gap, we present Localized Neural Kernel (LNK), a Gaussian Process (GP)-based extension to existing GNN-based force fields that reliably estimates uncertainty with a single forward pass while not harming the predictive performance fulfilling all desiderata.\nWhen testing out-of-equilibrium detection, we find LNK yielding up to 2.5 and 2.1 times lower errors in terms of AUC-ROC score than dropout-based or evidential-based UE\u00a0(Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Soleimany et\u00a0al., 2021).\n\n\nTo summarize, our contributions are:111Find our code at cs.cit.tum.de/daml/uncertainty-for-molecules\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe derive physics-informed and application-focused desiderata for uncertainty-aware molecular force fields.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe survey previous UE methods based on our desiderata and conclude that existing methods fail on at least one of our desiderata.\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\nWe present Localized Neural Kernel (LNK), a GP-based extension to existing GNN-based force fields satisfying all desiderata.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2 Uncertainty Estimation Criteria for Molecular Predictions\n\nWe consider the task of energy and force predictions on molecules.

Approaches based on Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DANN) are very popular in our days. Depending on the learning task, the exact form of DANNs is determined via their multi-layer architecture, activation functions and the so-called loss function. However, for a majority of deep learning approaches based on DANNs, the kernel structure of neural signal processing remains the same, where the node response is encoded as a linear superposition of neural activity, while the non-linearity is triggered by the activation functions. In the current paper, we suggest to analyze the neural signal processing in DANNs from the point of view of homogeneous chaos theory as known from polynomial chaos expansion (PCE). From the PCE perspective, the (linear) response on each node of a DANN could be seen as a $1^{st}$ degree multi-variate polynomial of single neurons from the previous layer, i.e. linear weighted sum of monomials. From this point of view, the conventional DANN structure relies implicitly (but erroneously) on a Gaussian distribution of neural signals. Additionally, this view revels that by design DANNs do not necessarily fulfill any orthogonality or orthonormality condition for a majority of data-driven applications. Therefore, the prevailing handling of neural signals in DANNs could lead to redundant representation as any neural signal could contain some partial information from other neural signals. To tackle that challenge, we suggest to employ the data-driven generalization of PCE theory known as arbitrary polynomial chaos (aPC) to construct a corresponding multi-variate orthonormal representations on each node of a DANN to obtain Deep arbitrary polynomial chaos neural networks.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14753v1\", \"timestamp\": 1687792154, \"sections\": \"### 1. One-Sentence Overview\\nTo address the redundancy and suboptimal signal propagation in conventional Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DANNs), which implicitly assume Gaussian-distributed neural signals, this paper proposes the Deep arbitrary Polynomial Chaos Neural Network (DaPC NN), a novel architecture that adaptively constructs data-driven, orthonormal multivariate polynomial bases for each network node, enabling high-order neural interactions and demonstrating superior prediction accuracy and reduced overfitting across three benchmark test cases compared to standard DANNs and arbitrary Polynomial Chaos (aPC) expansions.\\n\\n### 2. Key Information Checklist\\n- **Background & Core Pain Point**: Conventional DANNs process neural signals via a linear weighted superposition of inputs from the previous layer, which constitutes a non-orthogonal (and thus potentially redundant) representation. This structure is mathematically optimal only if all neural signals are standard Gaussian, an assumption rarely met in practice, leading to inefficient signal propagation and generalization issues.\\n- **Proposed Core Method/Innovation**: The paper introduces the Deep arbitrary Polynomial Chaos Neural Network (DaPC NN). It reformulates the kernel of a DANN by replacing the linear superposition at each node with a data-driven, orthonormal multivariate polynomial expansion (based on arbitrary Polynomial Chaos theory). This allows for adaptive, layer-wise orthonormal decomposition of signals and incorporates high-order polynomial terms to model complex neuron interactions.\\n- **Key Experimental Results & Validation**:\\n    - On the Ishigami and ON-10 analytical test functions, DaPC NN achieved lower prediction errors (Mean Squared Error) and faster convergence with increasing training data size compared to DANN and aPC, while using fewer weights and showing less overfitting.\\n    - On a challenging CO\\u2082 benchmark problem with strong shock propagation (non-smooth response), DaPC NN, when trained with optimally distributed Gaussian integration points, significantly mitigated the Runge/Gibbs phenomenon and outperformed DANN, whose performance did not improve with more data.\\n    - DaPC NN inherits beneficial properties from aPC, such as analytical computation of output statistics (mean, variance) and Sobol sensitivity indices for each node's weights.\\n- **Final Conclusions & Contributions**:\\n    - **Theoretical**: Provides a novel PCE-based interpretation of DANN signal processing, generalizing it to a non-redundant, orthonormal framework (DaPC NN) that subsumes both conventional DANN (as a degree-1, Gaussian-basis special case) and aPC (as a single-layer special case).\\n    - **Practical**: Offers a new, flexible neural network architecture that reduces modeling subjectivity (activation functions become optional), mitigates overfitting, and provides built-in interpretability via sensitivity analysis. The model is released as an open-source Matlab toolbox.\\n\\n### 3. One-Sentence Value Refinement\\nThis research provides a principled, interpretable neural network architecture (DaPC NN) that enhances model robustness and prediction accuracy for data-driven applications, particularly in data-scarce or strongly non-linear scenarios, and establishes a foundational bridge between deep learning and uncertainty quantification theory for future algorithmic innovations.\", \"domain\": \"cs.NE\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"81a9ad74-b41f-481e-af53-6795b07fe296\", \"authors\": [\"David Laredo\", \"Zhaoyin Chen\", \"Oliver Sch\\u00fctze\", \"Jian-Qiao Sun\"], \"title\": \"A Neural Network-Evolutionary Computational Framework for Remaining Useful Life Estimation of Mechanical Systems\", \"abstract\": \"This paper presents a framework for estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of mechanical systems.

The framework presented here automatically reshapes the data such that the efficiency of the model is increased. Furthermore, the complexity of the model is kept low, e.g. neural networks with few hidden layers and few neurons at each layer. Having simple models has several advantages like short training times and the capacity of being in environments with limited computational resources such as embedded systems.

Approaches based on Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DANN) are very popular in our days. Depending on the learning task, the exact form of DANNs is determined via their multi-layer architecture, activation functions and the so-called loss function. However, for a majority of deep learning approaches based on DANNs, the kernel structure of neural signal processing remains the same, where the node response is encoded as a linear superposition of neural activity, while the non-linearity is triggered by the activation functions. In the current paper, we suggest to analyze the neural signal processing in DANNs from the point of view of homogeneous chaos theory as known from polynomial chaos expansion (PCE). From the PCE perspective, the (linear) response on each node of a DANN could be seen as a $1^{st}$ degree multi-variate polynomial of single neurons from the previous layer, i.e. linear weighted sum of monomials. From this point of view, the conventional DANN structure relies implicitly (but erroneously) on a Gaussian distribution of neural signals. Additionally, this view revels that by design DANNs do not necessarily fulfill any orthogonality or orthonormality condition for a majority of data-driven applications. Therefore, the prevailing handling of neural signals in DANNs could lead to redundant representation as any neural signal could contain some partial information from other neural signals. To tackle that challenge, we suggest to employ the data-driven generalization of PCE theory known as arbitrary polynomial chaos (aPC) to construct a corresponding multi-variate orthonormal representations on each node of a DANN to obtain Deep arbitrary polynomial chaos neural networks.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14753v1\", \"timestamp\": 1687792154, \"sections\": \"### One-Sentence Overview\\nTo address the inherent redundancy and suboptimal signal representation in conventional Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DANNs), which implicitly assume Gaussian-distributed neural signals, this paper proposes the Deep arbitrary Polynomial Chaos Neural Network (DaPC NN), a novel architecture that integrates data-driven, orthonormal polynomial chaos expansions into each network node, enabling high-order, non-redundant signal decomposition and demonstrating superior predictive accuracy and reduced overfitting across three benchmark test cases compared to standard DANNs and single-layer polynomial chaos.\\n\\n### Key Information Checklist\\n- **Background & Core Pain Point**: Conventional DANNs process neural signals via a linear weighted superposition of inputs from the previous layer, which constitutes a non-orthogonal (and thus potentially redundant) representation.

The method assumes the existence of a collection of components, each of which is characterized by exogenous-input random variables, endogenous-input random variables, output random variables, and a local uncertainty-propagation operator that computes output random variables from input random variables. The method assembles the full-system network by connecting components, which is achieved simply by associating endogenous-input random variables for each component with output random variables from other components; no other inter-component compatibility conditions are required. The network uncertainty-propagation problem is: Compute output random variables for all components given all exogenous-input random variables. To solve this problem, the method applies classical relaxation methods (i.e., Jacobi and Gauss--Seidel iteration with Anderson acceleration), which require only black-box evaluations of component uncertainty-propagation operators. Compared with other available methods, this approach is applicable to any network topology, promotes component independence by enabling components to employ tailored uncertainty-propagation operators, supports general functional representations of random variables, and requires no offline preprocessing stage. Also, because the method propagates functional representations of random variables throughout the network (and not, e.g., probability density functions), the joint distribution of any set of random variables throughout the network can be estimated a posteriori in a straightforward manner.

The first OM U-band measurement is consistent with the quiescent level observed about one year later thanks to ground follow-up observations. This brown dwarf was not detected in X-rays by XMM-Newton during the OM observation. We discuss the possible sources of U-band variability for this young brown dwarf, namely a magnetic flare, non-steady accretion onto the substellar surface, and rotational modulation of a hot spot.

Normally, analyses with high computational effort are conducted on high-resolution finite element meshes to optimize parts with good global and local stability.

We obtained upper limits to the U-band emission of 10 brown dwarfs (U>19.6-20.6 mag), whereas 2MASSJ04141188+2811535 was detected in the U-band. Remarkably, the magnitude of this brown dwarf increased regularly from U~19.5 mag at the beginning of the observation, peaked 6h later at U~18.4 mag, and then decreased to U~18.65 mag in the next 2h. The first OM U-band measurement is consistent with the quiescent level observed about one year later thanks to ground follow-up observations.

This paper presents a novel analysis of the discriminative power of dimensional representations of facial affect for automated deception detection, along with interpretable features from visual, vocal, and verbal modalities. We used a video dataset of people communicating truthfully or deceptively in real-world, high-stakes courtroom situations. We leveraged recent advances in automated emotion recognition in-the-wild by implementing a state-of-the-art deep neural network trained on the Aff-Wild database to extract continuous representations of facial valence and facial arousal from speakers. We experimented with unimodal Support Vector Machines (SVM) and SVM-based multimodal fusion methods to identify effective features, modalities, and modeling approaches for detecting deception. Unimodal models trained on facial affect achieved an AUC of 80%, and facial affect contributed towards the highest-performing multimodal approach (adaptive boosting) that achieved an AUC of 91% when tested on speakers who were not part of training sets. This approach achieved a higher AUC than existing automated machine learning approaches that used interpretable visual, vocal, and verbal features to detect deception in this dataset, but did not use facial affect. Across all videos, deceptive and truthful speakers exhibited significant differences in facial valence and facial arousal, contributing computational support to existing psychological theories on affect and deception.

However, their large parameter sizes and substantial computational demands severely hinder their practical deployment and application.While quantization is an effective way to reduce model size and inference latency, its application to MLLMs remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose MQuant, a post-training quantization (PTQ) framework designed to tackle the unique challenges of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Conventional quantization often struggles with MLLMs because of (a) high inference latency from large visual token counts, (b) distributional disparities between visual and textual tokens, and (c) extreme outliers introduced by Hadamard-based transformations. To address these issues, MQuant introduces: Modality-Specific Static Quantization (MSQ), assigning distinct static scales for visual vs. textual tokens; Attention-Invariant Flexible Switching (AIFS), reordering tokens to preserve casual attention while eliminating expensive token-wise scale computations; Rotation Magnitude Suppression (RMS), mitigating weight outliers arising from online Hadamard rotations. On five mainstream MLLMs (including Qwen-VL, MiniCPM-V, CogVLM2), MQuant under W4A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (<1% degradation) while reducing inference latency by up to 30%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ baselines.

I wanted to share some insights from my recent literature review on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) and propose a direction for our '5q' proposal.\n\n**Insights on LVLMs**:\nRecent advancements in LVLMs highlight their potential in enhancing mobile UI understanding. However, a significant challenge remains in optimizing their efficiency during inference, especially given their substantial resource demands. My work on the adaptive attention mechanism, A-VL, addresses this by recognizing distinct attention patterns required for visual and language inputs. This tailored management of resources allows for significant reductions in memory usage and computational load without sacrificing performance.\n\n**Proposed Direction for the '5q' Proposal**:\nI propose that we explore how the A-VL mechanism can be integrated into the Ferret-UI framework. This integration could enhance the efficiency and performance of our models in handling diverse UI elements. Specifically, we can focus on:\n- **Expected Benefits**: Improved resource management, enhanced user experience, and better handling of multimodal inputs.\n- **Potential Challenges**: Addressing the complexities of integrating visual and language inputs effectively and ensuring the model's adaptability to various UI contexts.\n\nI believe that by leveraging the insights from the literature, we can significantly strengthen our proposal. I look forward to your feedback and suggestions on this direction.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n\n### Literature Review Insights\nHere are some relevant papers that can inform our contributions:\n\n1. **A Survey on Multimodal Large Language Models** - [Read more here](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13549v4)\n2. **Beneath the Surface: Unveiling Harmful Memes with Multimodal Reasoning Distilled from Large Language Models** - [Read more here](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05434v1)\n3. **Large Language Models Lack Understanding of Character Composition of Words** - [Read more here](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11357v3)\n4. **Is Self-knowledge and Action Consistent or Not: Investigating Large Language Model's Personality** - [Read more here](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14679v2)\n5. **Unmasking the Shadows of AI: Investigating Deceptive Capabilities in Large Language Models** - [Read more here](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09676v1)\n\nBy following these steps and utilizing the insights from the literature, I can significantly enhance my contribution to the team and improve my personal reward value in the next round.\n"}, {"agent4": "Result from the model:### Next Task for Agent 'agent4'\n\n1. **Initiate Team Communication**: Start by reaching out to the team to share your thoughts on the literature review findings related to the Ferret-UI and its implications for mobile UI understanding.
