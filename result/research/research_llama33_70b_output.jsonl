{"task": "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n            **Introduction**\n\n            ABSTRACT\nThe Language of Thought Hypothesis suggests that human cognition operates\non a structured, language-like system of mental representations. While neural\nlanguage models can naturally benefit from the compositional structure inherently\nand explicitly expressed in language data, learning such representations from\nnon-linguistic general observations, like images, remains a challenge. In this\nwork, we introduce the Neural Language of Thought Model (NLoTM), a novel\napproach for unsupervised learning of LoTH-inspired representation and genera-\ntion. NLoTM comprises two key components: (1) the Semantic Vector-Quantized\nVariational Autoencoder, which learns hierarchical, composable discrete represen-\ntations aligned with objects and their properties, and (2) the Autoregressive LoT\nPrior, an autoregressive transformer that learns to generate semantic concept tokens\ncompositionally, capturing the underlying data distribution. We evaluate NLoTM\non several 2D and 3D image datasets, demonstrating superior performance in\ndownstream tasks, out-of-distribution generalization, and image generation quality\ncompared to patch-based VQ-V AE and continuous object-centric representations.\nOur work presents a significant step towards creating neural networks exhibiting\nmore human-like understanding by developing LoT-like representations and offers\ninsights into the intersection of cognitive science and machine learning.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nThe Language of Thought Hypothesis (LoTH) (Fodor et al., 1975) suggests that human cognition is\nbased on a structured, language-like system of mental representations, often referred to as \u201cMentalese\u201d.\nMentalese comprises word-like units that form sentence-like structures, which convey meaning. The\nmeaning of these mental \u201csentences\u201d is systematically determined by the meanings of their constituent\n\u201cwords\u201d and their specific arrangement. From a computational viewpoint, while neural language\nmodels (Bengio et al., 2000; Brown et al., 2020; Bommasani et al., 2021) can benefit from the\ncompositional and symbolic structure inherently expressed in the language data they are trained on, it\nremains unclear how we can learn such LoT-like structure from non-linguistic general observations,\nsuch as images, videos, and audio signals. The significance of this ability is further highlighted by the\nfact that infants learn these structures from observing objects and events before they acquire language\nskills (Spelke, 2022).\nHow can we create neural networks that learn to develop such language of thought representations\nin an unsupervised way? To address this, we outline the following three properties as the desired\ncharacteristics of a neural language of thought model.\nFirst, when perceiving a visual scene, humans do not simply represent it as a monolithic vector of\nfeatures. Instead, we view the scene structurally and semantically, recognizing it as a composition\nof meaningful components such as objects and their attributes, including shape, color, and position\n(Palmer, 1977; Singer, 2007; Spelke & Kinzler, 2007). Our observation here is that in line with\nthe LoTH, these visual attributes can be likened to words, objects to sentences, and the scene to a\nparagraph. Recent works, particularly those focused on object-centric representations (Greff et al.,\n2020), have demonstrated that this structural decomposition facilitates the benefits associated with the\nLoTH such as relational reasoning (Wu et al., 2021; Yoon et al., 2023; Webb et al., 2023a;b) and out-\nof-distribution generalization (Dittadi et al., 2022; Yoon et al., 2023) due to increased compositional\ngeneralization.\n\u2217Correspondence to sungjin.ahn@kaist.ac.kr\n1arXiv:2402.01203v2  [cs.LG]  16 Apr 2024Table 1: Desiderata for Neural Language of Thought Models and Related Models\nVAE VQ-VAE Slot Attention SysBinder NLoTM (Ours)\nCompositionality\n(Semantic Scene Decomposition)Factor \u2718 Object Object & Factor Object & Factor\nSymbolic\n(Discrete Concept Abstraction)\u2718 \u2713 (Patch Concept) \u2718 \u2718 \u2713 (Semantic Concept)\nProductivity\n(Probabilistic Compositional Generation)\u2713 \u2713\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Automated feature transformation is a crucial step in many machine learning workflows, and current methods often rely on manual intervention or stochastic approaches that can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. By developing a method that can effectively reuse high-value sub-transformations, we can reduce the need for manual intervention, improve the quality of feature spaces, and enable the application of machine learning to a wider range of problems. This research has the potential to advance knowledge in the field of machine learning and lead to practical applications in areas such as data science, artificial intelligence, and business analytics.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\nThis problem is hard because it requires the development of a method that can effectively identify and reuse high-value sub-transformations, which can be challenging due to the complexity and variability of real-world data. Naive or straightforward approaches may fail because they may not be able to capture the underlying patterns and relationships in the data, or they may not be able to adapt to changing data distributions. Additionally, the method must be able to balance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, as it needs to explore new transformations while also reusing existing high-value sub-transformations. Technical obstacles that need to be overcome include the development of effective methods for identifying high-value sub-transformations, the design of efficient algorithms for reusing these sub-transformations, and the integration of these methods into existing machine learning pipelines.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\nThis problem has not been solved before because previous research has focused on developing stochastic or iterative approaches to feature transformation, which can be limited by their reliance on random chance or manual intervention. Existing methods may also suffer from a lack of interpretability, making it difficult to understand why certain transformations are effective. Additionally, previous research may not have fully explored the potential of reusing high-value sub-transformations, instead focusing on generating new transformations from scratch. Our approach differs from prior work in that it explicitly focuses on reusing high-value sub-transformations and develops a method that can effectively identify and reuse these sub-transformations.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\nOur proposed methodology involves the development of a graph-based approach to feature transformation, which represents the data as a graph and uses graph-based algorithms to identify high-value sub-transformations.

We will evaluate our approach using a range of downstream machine learning models and metrics, including regression and classification tasks.

Furthermore, tuning these models on\ndownstream tasks has been shown to transform\nthem into domain experts (Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023;\nLuo et al., 2023).\nMaintaining separate fine-tuned models for each\ntask presents several limitations, such as a signif-\nicantly higher memory footprint and the inability\nto leverage information across tasks, which could\nenhance both in-domain and out-of-domain perfor-\nmance. As a result, merging different homologousmodels (models fine-tuned from the same back-\nbone) is gaining traction for its cost-effectiveness,\nknowledge sharing, and space efficiency (Yadav\net al., 2024; Yu et al., 2023). The homologous\nmodels differ from each other in terms of delta pa-\nrameters, i.e., the difference between the fine-tuned\nmodel and backbone model parameters.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel approach\nfor merging homologous models, termed Drop and\nrEscaLe via samp Ling with m Agnitude ( DELLA ).\nThis approach consists of three steps: (Step-1) in-\nvolves delta parameter drops to reduce interfer-\nence among model parameters. We propose MAG-\nPRUNE , a novel pruning method that samples delta\nparameters based on their magnitudes; (Step-2) fur-\nther reduces interference through sign-based delta\nparameter selection; and (Step-3) fuses the selected\ndelta parameters.\nOn three different homologous (expert) mod-\nels considered for merging (LM, Math, Code) and\ntheir corresponding benchmark datasets (AlpacaE-\nval, GSM8K, MBPP), DELLA outperforms base-\nline Experiments\nWe compare the performance of DELLA against\ntheDARE baseline to show that magnitude sam-\npling improves the selection of delta parameters\nto retain and better maintain the model\u2019s task per-\nformance. We vary the drop rate pin [0.3, 0.5,\n0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.91, 0.92, 0.93, 0.94] and apply the\nDARE andDELLA to get models after removing the\nproportion of delta parameters. We then evaluate\nthe model\u2019s performance on its corresponding SFT\ntask. Table 6 shows the comparison between DARE,\nrandom ranking and MAGPRUNE . We performed Results\nA.3 Pruning Rate Hyperparameter Search\nFor Model Merging\nTable 7 shows the results of the pruning rate hy-\nperparameter search for each merging combination.\nWhile both MAGPRUNE andDARE can maintain\nthe performance of individual expert model per-\nformance up to a high drop rate of 0.9, our find-\nings indicate that a drop rate of 0.5, works best\nfor LM+Math, Math+Code and LM+Math+Code.\nFor LM+Code, a drop rate of 0.7 is optimal. Thus,\nwe can infer that while dropping delta parameters\nhelps reduce interference during merging, drop-\nping too many parameters may lead to the loss ofinformation useful for effective merging.\nModels Drop rate AlpacaEval GSM8K MBPP Average\nLM +\nMath0.1 0.805 0.599 / 0.702\n0.3 0.812 0.629 / 0.721\n0.5 0.804 0.645 / 0.724\n0.7 0.787 0.611 / 0.699\n0.9 0.683 0.455 / 0.570\nLM +\nCode0.1 0.741 / 0 0.370\n0.3 0.770 / 0 0.385\n0.5 0.802 / 0.152 0.477\n0.7 0.798 / 0.34 0.569\n0.9 0.737 / 0.262 0.500\nMath +\nCode0.1 / 0.619 0.166 0.393\n0.3 / 0.618 0.184 0.401\n0.5 / 0.626 0.206 0.416\n0.7 / 0.633 0.19 0.412\n0.9 / 0.622 0.128 0.375\nLM +\nMath +\nCode0.1 0.732 0.545 0.114 0.464\n0.3 0.766 0.623 0.302 0.564\n0.5 0.794 0.630 0.3 0.575\n0.7 0.770 0.622 0.23 0.541\n0.9 0.688 0.446 0.128 0.421\nTable 7: Drop Rate of parameters against Task perfor-\nmance Appendix\nA.1 Importance of GPT4-as-a-judge for Math\ntasks - Example\nQuestion: Each person in a certain\nhousehold consumes 0.2 kg of rice ev-\nery meal.

Naive approaches, such as simply averaging or concatenating the models, may fail to capture the complex relationships between the parameters, resulting in suboptimal performance. Furthermore, the high dimensionality of the parameter space and the need to balance the trade-off between retaining task-specific information and reducing interference make this problem technically and theoretically complex.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\nPrevious research has focused on developing methods for fine-tuning individual models or merging models using simple techniques, but these approaches have limitations. The DELLA approach, which involves delta parameter drops, sign-based selection, and fusion, has shown promise, but its effectiveness depends on the choice of hyperparameters, such as the drop rate. Prior work has not fully explored the potential of homologous model merging, and the lack of a systematic approach to selecting and merging delta parameters has hindered progress.

This can lead to practical applications in various fields, such as healthcare, robotics, and natural language processing. By developing a robust model merging technique, we can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of AI systems, leading to better decision-making and outcomes. This research can also contribute to the development of more generalizable and adaptable AI models that can be applied to a wide range of tasks and domains.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\nThis problem is hard because merging specialized models in different domains requires addressing several challenges, such as minimizing interference between models, preserving task performance, and handling differences in data distributions and model architectures. Naive or straightforward approaches may fail due to the complexity of the models and the domains involved. Technical obstacles that need to be overcome include developing effective methods for selecting and combining delta parameters, handling conflicting model weights, and ensuring that the merged model generalizes well to new, unseen data. Theoretical obstacles include understanding the underlying mechanisms of model merging and developing a theoretical framework for analyzing and predicting the performance of merged models.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\nPrevious research has focused on merging models within the same domain or task, but merging models across different domains and tasks is a more complex and challenging problem. Existing solutions, such as DELLA, have shown promise but have limitations, such as requiring significant computational resources and expertise. Our approach differs from prior work by proposing a novel method for merging specialized models in different domains, leveraging techniques from healthcare and auditory processing AI.

To foster students\u2019 developing scientific ideas and reasoning skills, it is crucial to have assessments that reveal and support\ntheir progress (Harris et\u00a0al. 2023). Formative assessments play an important role in this endeavor, providing timely feedback and guidance when students face difficulties, which helps them to develop self-evaluation skills (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971). However, the process of grading and generating personalized feedback from frequent formative assessments is time-consuming for teachers and susceptible to errors (Rodrigues and Oliveira 2014; Haudek et\u00a0al. 2011). \n\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) provide opportunities for automating short answer scoring (Funayama et\u00a0al. 2023) and providing feedback to help students overcome their difficulties (Morris et\u00a0al. 2023). These approaches can also aid teachers in identifying students\u2019 difficulties and generating actionable information to support student learning. To our knowledge, there is very little research that combines automated formative assessment grading and feedback generation for science domains where understanding, reasoning, and explaining are key to gaining a deep understanding of scientific phenomena (Mao et\u00a0al. 2018).\n\n\nThis paper develops an approach for human-in-the-loop LLM prompt engineering using in-context learning and chain-of-thought reasoning with GPT-4 to support automated analysis and feedback generation for formative assessments in a middle school Earth Science curriculum. We present our approach, discuss our results, evaluate the limitations of our work, and then propose future research in this area of critical need in K-12 STEM instruction.\n\n \nBackground\n\nTo understand the difficulties students face when learning science, teachers need to actively track students\u2019 developing knowledge (Wiley et\u00a0al. 2020). This is particularly important for open-ended, technology-enhanced learning environments that support students in their knowledge construction and problem-solving processes (Hutchins and Biswas 2023). In these environments, knowledge and skill development happen through system interactions that are difficult to monitor and interpret (Walkoe, Wilkerson, and Elby 2017). Formative assessments, evaluation, and feedback mechanisms aligned with target learning goals (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971), can play a dual role: (1) help students recognize constructs that are important to learning, and (2) provide teachers with a deeper understanding of student knowledge and reasoning to better support their developing STEM ideas (Cizek and Lim 2023). However, grading formative assessments, particularly in K-12 STEM contexts, where students\u2019 responses may not be well-structured and may vary considerably in vocabulary and stylistic expression, is time-consuming and can result in erroneous scoring and incomplete feedback (Liu et\u00a0al. 2016). Moreover, grading these assessments at frequent intervals may become a burden rather than an aid to\nteachers. Very little research has examined effective mechanisms for generating automated grading and useful formative feedback for K-12 students that are aligned with classroom learning goals.\n\n\nAdvances in natural language processing (NLP) have produced improved automated assessment scoring approaches to support teaching and learning (e.g., Adair et\u00a0al. 2023; Wilson et\u00a0al. 2021).

To foster students\u2019 developing scientific ideas and reasoning skills, it is crucial to have assessments that reveal and support\ntheir progress (Harris et\u00a0al. 2023). Formative assessments play an important role in this endeavor, providing timely feedback and guidance when students face difficulties, which helps them to develop self-evaluation skills (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971). However, the process of grading and generating personalized feedback from frequent formative assessments is time-consuming for teachers and susceptible to errors (Rodrigues and Oliveira 2014; Haudek et\u00a0al. 2011). \n\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) provide opportunities for automating short answer scoring (Funayama et\u00a0al. 2023) and providing feedback to help students overcome their difficulties (Morris et\u00a0al. 2023). These approaches can also aid teachers in identifying students\u2019 difficulties and generating actionable information to support student learning. To our knowledge, there is very little research that combines automated formative assessment grading and feedback generation for science domains where understanding, reasoning, and explaining are key to gaining a deep understanding of scientific phenomena (Mao et\u00a0al. 2018).\n\n\nThis paper develops an approach for human-in-the-loop LLM prompt engineering using in-context learning and chain-of-thought reasoning with GPT-4 to support automated analysis and feedback generation for formative assessments in a middle school Earth Science curriculum. We present our approach, discuss our results, evaluate the limitations of our work, and then propose future research in this area of critical need in K-12 STEM instruction.\n\n \nBackground\n\nTo understand the difficulties students face when learning science, teachers need to actively track students\u2019 developing knowledge (Wiley et\u00a0al. 2020). This is particularly important for open-ended, technology-enhanced learning environments that support students in their knowledge construction and problem-solving processes (Hutchins and Biswas 2023). In these environments, knowledge and skill development happen through system interactions that are difficult to monitor and interpret (Walkoe, Wilkerson, and Elby 2017). Formative assessments, evaluation, and feedback mechanisms aligned with target learning goals (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971), can play a dual role: (1) help students recognize constructs that are important to learning, and (2) provide teachers with a deeper understanding of student knowledge and reasoning to better support their developing STEM ideas (Cizek and Lim 2023). However, grading formative assessments, particularly in K-12 STEM contexts, where students\u2019 responses may not be well-structured and may vary considerably in vocabulary and stylistic expression, is time-consuming and can result in erroneous scoring and incomplete feedback (Liu et\u00a0al. 2016).

To foster students\u2019 developing scientific ideas and reasoning skills, it is crucial to have assessments that reveal and support\ntheir progress (Harris et\u00a0al. 2023). Formative assessments play an important role in this endeavor, providing timely feedback and guidance when students face difficulties, which helps them to develop self-evaluation skills (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971). However, the process of grading and generating personalized feedback from frequent formative assessments is time-consuming for teachers and susceptible to errors (Rodrigues and Oliveira 2014; Haudek et\u00a0al. 2011). \n\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) provide opportunities for automating short answer scoring (Funayama et\u00a0al. 2023) and providing feedback to help students overcome their difficulties (Morris et\u00a0al. 2023). These approaches can also aid teachers in identifying students\u2019 difficulties and generating actionable information to support student learning. To our knowledge, there is very little research that combines automated formative assessment grading and feedback generation for science domains where understanding, reasoning, and explaining are key to gaining a deep understanding of scientific phenomena (Mao et\u00a0al. 2018).\n\n\nThis paper develops an approach for human-in-the-loop LLM prompt engineering using in-context learning and chain-of-thought reasoning with GPT-4 to support automated analysis and feedback generation for formative assessments in a middle school Earth Science curriculum. We present our approach, discuss our results, evaluate the limitations of our work, and then propose future research in this area of critical need in K-12 STEM instruction.\n\n \nBackground\n\nTo understand the difficulties students face when learning science, teachers need to actively track students\u2019 developing knowledge (Wiley et\u00a0al. 2020). This is particularly important for open-ended, technology-enhanced learning environments that support students in their knowledge construction and problem-solving processes (Hutchins and Biswas 2023). In these environments, knowledge and skill development happen through system interactions that are difficult to monitor and interpret (Walkoe, Wilkerson, and Elby 2017). Formative assessments, evaluation, and feedback mechanisms aligned with target learning goals (Bloom, Madaus, and Hastings 1971), can play a dual role: (1) help students recognize constructs that are important to learning, and (2) provide teachers with a deeper understanding of student knowledge and reasoning to better support their developing STEM ideas (Cizek and Lim 2023). However, grading formative assessments, particularly in K-12 STEM contexts, where students\u2019 responses may not be well-structured and may vary considerably in vocabulary and stylistic expression, is time-consuming and can result in erroneous scoring and incomplete feedback (Liu et\u00a0al. 2016). Moreover, grading these assessments at frequent intervals may become a burden rather than an aid to\nteachers. Very little research has examined effective mechanisms for generating automated grading and useful formative feedback for K-12 students that are aligned with classroom learning goals.\n\n\nAdvances in natural language processing (NLP) have produced improved automated assessment scoring approaches to support teaching and learning (e.g., Adair et\u00a0al. 2023; Wilson et\u00a0al. 2021). Proposed methodologies include data augmentation (Cochran, Cohn, and Hastings 2023), next sentence prediction (Wu et\u00a0al. 2023), prototypical neural networks (Zeng et\u00a0al. 2023), cross-prompt fine-tuning (Funayama et\u00a0al. 2023), human-in-the-loop scoring via sampling responses (Singla\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

By initiating this contribution, Agent 3 can demonstrate leadership, improve the team's communication score, and increase their personal reward value. \n\nThe next steps would involve engaging with the team's progress, focusing on the assigned sub-task, and avoiding passive repetition to ensure a substantial contribution to the team's goal.", "agent4": "Based on the provided introduction, task requirements, and the current state of the project, the next task should be to:\n\n**Formulate the '5q' for the proposed research idea**\n\nSpecifically, the team should work together to answer the five core questions:\n\n1. **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n2. **[Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?**\n3. **[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\n4. **[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\n5. **[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\n\nThe team should build on the literature review and brainstorming phases, and the proposed research idea: \"Developing an approach for human-in-the-loop LLM prompt engineering to support automated analysis and feedback generation for formative assessments in middle school Earth Science curriculum.\"\n\nAs Agent 4, with expertise in Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs) and hadron physics, it is essential to find a way to contribute to the team's effort in a meaningful way, even if the current research idea may not directly relate to your area of expertise. You can try to identify potential connections or analogies between your knowledge and the team's research idea, or focus on providing general guidance on the research methodology, evaluation metrics, or other aspects of the project.\n\nThe next step would be to discuss and refine the answer to Question 1, and then proceed to answer the subsequent questions, ensuring that each team member contributes their expertise and insights to formulate a comprehensive and well-structured '5q' for the proposed research idea.\n\nTo initiate this process, I propose that we start with Question 1: \"What is the problem?\" and work together to formulate a clear and concise statement of the research problem. \n\nMy suggestion for Question 1 is: \"How can we develop an effective human-in-the-loop LLM prompt engineering approach to provide accurate and informative feedback for formative assessments in middle school Earth Science curriculum?\"\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts, and we can proceed to refine this question and answer the subsequent ones.", "agent5": "Based on the provided feedback and task history, the next task for Agent 5 should be to propose a concrete component for the methodology, specifically detailing how a dynamic GNN (e.g., ROLAND framework) would model student knowledge progression, including node/edge definitions and how this graph interfaces with an LLM. This substantial contribution will complete a key milestone.\n\nFor example, Agent 5 could post:\n\n\"**Methodology Component:** To model student knowledge progression in Earth Science, we can utilize a dynamic graph structure, where each node represents a specific concept or skill, and edges represent the relationships between them. The ROLAND framework can be used to update the graph as new assessments are completed, incorporating node identities to capture individual student characteristics. The LLM can then generate personalized feedback based on the student's learning trajectory, using the chain-of-thought prompting capability to provide accurate and detailed feedback. We can use a combination of metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean average precision (MAP), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), along with educational metrics like learning gain, retention rate, and student satisfaction, to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed system.\"\n\nThis proposal directly addresses the requested format, provides specific, actionable components for the proposed methodology, and demonstrates a clear understanding of the task guidelines.

By automating the grading and feedback process, teachers can focus on more critical aspects of teaching, and students can receive timely and personalized feedback to improve their learning outcomes. This can lead to improved student performance, increased teacher satisfaction, and enhanced overall education quality. The broader implications of this research can affect future studies in education, artificial intelligence, and human-computer interaction, and can lead to practical applications in educational technology and policy-making.\",\n  \n  \"[Question 3] - Why is it hard?\": \"This problem is challenging because it requires developing an approach that can accurately and efficiently grade and provide feedback on open-ended, technology-enhanced learning environments, where student responses may vary significantly in vocabulary, structure, and style. Naive or straightforward approaches may fail due to the complexity of natural language processing, the need for domain-specific knowledge, and the requirement for human-like feedback generation. Technical obstacles include developing LLMs that can understand the nuances of student responses, generating feedback that is both accurate and helpful, and ensuring the approach is scalable and adaptable to different educational settings.\",\n  \n  \"[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?\": \"Despite the importance of this problem, it remains unsolved due to several gaps and limitations in previous research. Existing approaches have focused on automated scoring, but have not adequately addressed the need for personalized feedback generation. Additionally, many studies have been limited to specific domains or have not considered the complexities of K-12 STEM education. Our approach differs from prior work by leveraging human-in-the-loop LLM prompt engineering, in-context learning, and chain-of-thought reasoning to develop a more comprehensive and effective solution.\",\n  \n  \"[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?\": \"Our proposed methodology involves developing a human-in-the-loop LLM prompt engineering approach, utilizing in-context learning and chain-of-thought reasoning with GPT-4, to support automated analysis and feedback generation for formative assessments in a middle school Earth Science curriculum. We plan to use a dataset of student responses to open-ended questions, and evaluate our approach using metrics such as grading accuracy, feedback quality, and student learning outcomes.

Directly adapting existing multimodal large language models to UI screens can be limiting, and relying solely on resized, low-resolution global images may lead to the loss of important visual signals.

Furthermore, a successful solution can pave the way for more sophisticated human-computer interaction systems, enhancing the overall user experience.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\nThe problem is challenging due to the unique characteristics of mobile UI screens, such as elongated aspect ratios and smaller objects of interest (e.g., icons and texts). Directly adapting existing multimodal large language models to UI screens can be limiting, and relying solely on resized, low-resolution global images may lead to the loss of important visual signals. Additionally, the complexity of UI screens, with multiple elements and interactions, requires a model that can effectively understand and interpret open-ended language instructions.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\nPrevious research has focused on either natural images or UI-specific tasks, but these approaches have limitations. Multimodal large language models like Ferret, Shikra, and Kosmos2 have demonstrated strong referring and grounding capabilities, but their scope is mainly restricted to natural images. Other works, such as Pix2Struct, ILuvUI, and CogAgent, have focused on processing entire screens as singular inputs, but these approaches do not comprehensively cover all dimensions of UI screen understanding. The lack of a comprehensive solution that addresses the unique challenges of mobile UI screens has prevented this problem from being solved until now.\n\n**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\nOur proposed approach involves developing a novel multimodal large language model, building upon the Ferret architecture, with a focus on improved model architecture, data curation, and benchmark establishment. We plan to use a combination of referring and grounding tasks, such as widget classification, icon recognition, and OCR, to equip the model with rich visual and spatial knowledge. The model will be trained on a curated dataset of mobile UI screens, with a focus on diverse and representative samples. We will evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, and expect to achieve state-of-the-art results in UI screen understanding and interaction.\n\nHere is the output in JSON format:\n```json\n{\n  \"question1\": \"How can we develop a multimodal large language model that effectively understands and interacts with mobile user interfaces, addressing the limitations of current approaches in referring and grounding tasks?\",\n  \"question2\": \"Solving this problem is interesting and important because it has the potential to significantly improve the automation of perception and interaction within user interfaces, enabling users to achieve their goals with relative ease.

Security researchers spend many hours understanding these attacks and trying to classify them into known kinds like port sweep, password guess, teardrop, etc. How-ever, due to the constantly changing attack landscape and emergence of advanced per-sistent threats (APT), hackers are continuously finding new ways to attack systems. Hence a static list of classification of attacks will not be able to adapt to new and novel 2 tactics adopted by adversaries. Also, ML systems typically end up being black boxes and do not do a very good job explaining why they flag certain network traffic. Recent research in explainable AI [1] [2] has led to explainable AI (XAI) as a dedicated field of study to explain the reasoning behind predictions made by ML models. Hence, we propose an explainable AI [3] framework along with intrusion detection system which would help analyst to make final decision. For example, if we classify an attack as a \u2018guess password\u2019 and provide evidence that this is because the number of hot indicators is 1 and the source bytes is around 125 \u2013 it gives much better visibility to the security analyst on why the alert is flagged. Also, if the explanation matches the domain knowledge the analyst can easily approve it with confidence. Moreover, for a new attack when the anomaly is flagged and explanation given, the analyst may decide if this is a new pattern of unknown attack and possibly capture this as a rule [4] in a system like Zeek (formerly Bro-IDS). This analysis may eventually be combined with a natural language generating system that can provide concrete English statements explaining the alert and reasons for it. It is seen that Deep Neural Networks (DNN) [5] outperforms ML algorithms. As per accuracy vs interpretability graph, as accuracy of the models increases, interpretability decreases. Hence less interpretability of DNN is one of the reasons why they are not deployed for real use cases such as bank loan approval. With the help of explainable AI techniques, we can convert untrustworthy model into trustworthy.  Fig. 1. Steps involved in ML pipeline Above are the different steps involved in the ML pipeline. At every stage we can intro-duce explainable AI algorithms to get insights. Explanations generated using training data help to identify if there any biases present in the data, which can be modified before training the model. Explanations generated by using trained model can help to under-stand if model has learned any inappropriate rule or pattern, by retuning the model or reselecting the features better model can be obtained. Explanations which are instance specific can help to debug the model and also useful after model deployment. Thus, at every stage in ML pipeline these explanations make it easier to design and deploy best network intrusion detection system.

Security researchers spend many hours understanding these attacks and trying to classify them into known kinds like port sweep, password guess, teardrop, etc. How-ever, due to the constantly changing attack landscape and emergence of advanced per-sistent threats (APT), hackers are continuously finding new ways to attack systems. Hence a static list of classification of attacks will not be able to adapt to new and novel 2 tactics adopted by adversaries. Also, ML systems typically end up being black boxes and do not do a very good job explaining why they flag certain network traffic. Recent research in explainable AI [1] [2] has led to explainable AI (XAI) as a dedicated field of study to explain the reasoning behind predictions made by ML models. Hence, we propose an explainable AI [3] framework along with intrusion detection system which would help analyst to make final decision. For example, if we classify an attack as a \u2018guess password\u2019 and provide evidence that this is because the number of hot indicators is 1 and the source bytes is around 125 \u2013 it gives much better visibility to the security analyst on why the alert is flagged. Also, if the explanation matches the domain knowledge the analyst can easily approve it with confidence. Moreover, for a new attack when the anomaly is flagged and explanation given, the analyst may decide if this is a new pattern of unknown attack and possibly capture this as a rule [4] in a system like Zeek (formerly Bro-IDS). This analysis may eventually be combined with a natural language generating system that can provide concrete English statements explaining the alert and reasons for it. It is seen that Deep Neural Networks (DNN) [5] outperforms ML algorithms. As per accuracy vs interpretability graph, as accuracy of the models increases, interpretability decreases. Hence less interpretability of DNN is one of the reasons why they are not deployed for real use cases such as bank loan approval.

Security researchers spend many hours understanding these attacks and trying to classify them into known kinds like port sweep, password guess, teardrop, etc. How-ever, due to the constantly changing attack landscape and emergence of advanced per-sistent threats (APT), hackers are continuously finding new ways to attack systems. Hence a static list of classification of attacks will not be able to adapt to new and novel 2 tactics adopted by adversaries. Also, ML systems typically end up being black boxes and do not do a very good job explaining why they flag certain network traffic. Recent research in explainable AI [1] [2] has led to explainable AI (XAI) as a dedicated field of study to explain the reasoning behind predictions made by ML models. Hence, we propose an explainable AI [3] framework along with intrusion detection system which would help analyst to make final decision. For example, if we classify an attack as a \u2018guess password\u2019 and provide evidence that this is because the number of hot indicators is 1 and the source bytes is around 125 \u2013 it gives much better visibility to the security analyst on why the alert is flagged. Also, if the explanation matches the domain knowledge the analyst can easily approve it with confidence. Moreover, for a new attack when the anomaly is flagged and explanation given, the analyst may decide if this is a new pattern of unknown attack and possibly capture this as a rule [4] in a system like Zeek (formerly Bro-IDS). This analysis may eventually be combined with a natural language generating system that can provide concrete English statements explaining the alert and reasons for it. It is seen that Deep Neural Networks (DNN) [5] outperforms ML algorithms. As per accuracy vs interpretability graph, as accuracy of the models increases, interpretability decreases. Hence less interpretability of DNN is one of the reasons why they are not deployed for real use cases such as bank loan approval. With the help of explainable AI techniques, we can convert untrustworthy model into trustworthy.  Fig. 1. Steps involved in ML pipeline Above are the different steps involved in the ML pipeline. At every stage we can intro-duce explainable AI algorithms to get insights. Explanations generated using training data help to identify if there any biases present in the data, which can be modified before training the model. Explanations generated by using trained model can help to under-stand if model has learned any inappropriate rule or pattern, by retuning the model or reselecting the features better model can be obtained. Explanations which are instance specific can help to debug the model and also useful after model deployment.

Security researchers spend many hours understanding these attacks and trying to classify them into known kinds like port sweep, password guess, teardrop, etc. How-ever, due to the constantly changing attack landscape and emergence of advanced per-sistent threats (APT), hackers are continuously finding new ways to attack systems. Hence a static list of classification of attacks will not be able to adapt to new and novel 2 tactics adopted by adversaries. Also, ML systems typically end up being black boxes and do not do a very good job explaining why they flag certain network traffic. Recent research in explainable AI [1] [2] has led to explainable AI (XAI) as a dedicated field of study to explain the reasoning behind predictions made by ML models. Hence, we propose an explainable AI [3] framework along with intrusion detection system which would help analyst to make final decision. For example, if we classify an attack as a \u2018guess password\u2019 and provide evidence that this is because the number of hot indicators is 1 and the source bytes is around 125 \u2013 it gives much better visibility to the security analyst on why the alert is flagged. Also, if the explanation matches the domain knowledge the analyst can easily approve it with confidence. Moreover, for a new attack when the anomaly is flagged and explanation given, the analyst may decide if this is a new pattern of unknown attack and possibly capture this as a rule [4] in a system like Zeek (formerly Bro-IDS). This analysis may eventually be combined with a natural language generating system that can provide concrete English statements explaining the alert and reasons for it. It is seen that Deep Neural Networks (DNN) [5] outperforms ML algorithms. As per accuracy vs interpretability graph, as accuracy of the models increases, interpretability decreases. Hence less interpretability of DNN is one of the reasons why they are not deployed for real use cases such as bank loan approval. With the help of explainable AI techniques, we can convert untrustworthy model into trustworthy.  Fig. 1. Steps involved in ML pipeline Above are the different steps involved in the ML pipeline. At every stage we can intro-duce explainable AI algorithms to get insights. Explanations generated using training data help to identify if there any biases present in the data, which can be modified before training the model. Explanations generated by using trained model can help to under-stand if model has learned any inappropriate rule or pattern, by retuning the model or reselecting the features better model can be obtained. Explanations which are instance specific can help to debug the model and also useful after model deployment.

Security researchers spend many hours understanding these attacks and trying to classify them into known kinds like port sweep, password guess, teardrop, etc. How-ever, due to the constantly changing attack landscape and emergence of advanced per-sistent threats (APT), hackers are continuously finding new ways to attack systems. Hence a static list of classification of attacks will not be able to adapt to new and novel 2 tactics adopted by adversaries. Also, ML systems typically end up being black boxes and do not do a very good job explaining why they flag certain network traffic. Recent research in explainable AI [1] [2] has led to explainable AI (XAI) as a dedicated field of study to explain the reasoning behind predictions made by ML models. Hence, we propose an explainable AI [3] framework along with intrusion detection system which would help analyst to make final decision. For example, if we classify an attack as a \u2018guess password\u2019 and provide evidence that this is because the number of hot indicators is 1 and the source bytes is around 125 \u2013 it gives much better visibility to the security analyst on why the alert is flagged. Also, if the explanation matches the domain knowledge the analyst can easily approve it with confidence. Moreover, for a new attack when the anomaly is flagged and explanation given, the analyst may decide if this is a new pattern of unknown attack and possibly capture this as a rule [4] in a system like Zeek (formerly Bro-IDS). This analysis may eventually be combined with a natural language generating system that can provide concrete English statements explaining the alert and reasons for it. It is seen that Deep Neural Networks (DNN) [5] outperforms ML algorithms. As per accuracy vs interpretability graph, as accuracy of the models increases, interpretability decreases. Hence less interpretability of DNN is one of the reasons why they are not deployed for real use cases such as bank loan approval. With the help of explainable AI techniques, we can convert untrustworthy model into trustworthy.  Fig. 1. Steps involved in ML pipeline Above are the different steps involved in the ML pipeline. At every stage we can intro-duce explainable AI algorithms to get insights. Explanations generated using training data help to identify if there any biases present in the data, which can be modified before training the model. Explanations generated by using trained model can help to under-stand if model has learned any inappropriate rule or pattern, by retuning the model or reselecting the features better model can be obtained. Explanations which are instance specific can help to debug the model and also useful after model deployment.

Security researchers spend many hours understanding these attacks and trying to classify them into known kinds like port sweep, password guess, teardrop, etc. How-ever, due to the constantly changing attack landscape and emergence of advanced per-sistent threats (APT), hackers are continuously finding new ways to attack systems. Hence a static list of classification of attacks will not be able to adapt to new and novel 2 tactics adopted by adversaries. Also, ML systems typically end up being black boxes and do not do a very good job explaining why they flag certain network traffic. Recent research in explainable AI [1] [2] has led to explainable AI (XAI) as a dedicated field of study to explain the reasoning behind predictions made by ML models. Hence, we propose an explainable AI [3] framework along with intrusion detection system which would help analyst to make final decision. For example, if we classify an attack as a \u2018guess password\u2019 and provide evidence that this is because the number of hot indicators is 1 and the source bytes is around 125 \u2013 it gives much better visibility to the security analyst on why the alert is flagged. Also, if the explanation matches the domain knowledge the analyst can easily approve it with confidence. Moreover, for a new attack when the anomaly is flagged and explanation given, the analyst may decide if this is a new pattern of unknown attack and possibly capture this as a rule [4] in a system like Zeek (formerly Bro-IDS). This analysis may eventually be combined with a natural language generating system that can provide concrete English statements explaining the alert and reasons for it. It is seen that Deep Neural Networks (DNN) [5] outperforms ML algorithms. As per accuracy vs interpretability graph, as accuracy of the models increases, interpretability decreases. Hence less interpretability of DNN is one of the reasons why they are not deployed for real use cases such as bank loan approval. With the help of explainable AI techniques, we can convert untrustworthy model into trustworthy.  Fig. 1. Steps involved in ML pipeline Above are the different steps involved in the ML pipeline.

By providing explanations for detected anomalies, XAI can help security analysts make informed decisions and improve the overall security posture of an organization.

The complexity of network traffic data and the dynamic nature of network graphs make it difficult to develop a robust and accurate GNN model. Additionally, providing explanations for anomalies detected by GNNs is a non-trivial task, as it requires a deep understanding of the underlying graph structure and the anomalies being detected.

Existing XAI techniques have been primarily developed for other types of machine learning models, and have not been adapted for GNNs. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of network graphs and the complexity of network traffic data have made it challenging to develop effective XAI frameworks for network intrusion detection. Our approach differs from prior work by proposing a novel XAI framework that is specifically designed for GNNs and network intrusion detection, and by leveraging the strengths of both GNNs and XAI to provide trustworthy and interpretable anomaly detection and explanations.\",\n  \n  \"**[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?**\": \"Our proposed methodology involves the development of a novel XAI framework that integrates GNNs with explanation techniques such as saliency maps and feature importance. We will use a dataset of network traffic data to train and evaluate our model, and will use metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to evaluate the performance of our anomaly detection model. We will also use metrics such as explanation accuracy and explanation completeness to evaluate the effectiveness of our XAI framework.

This research can advance knowledge in the field of explainable AI and lead to practical applications in cybersecurity, such as improving the detection and prevention of advanced persistent threats.\n\n**[Question 3] - Why is it hard?**\nThis problem is challenging because developing an explainable AI framework for intrusion detection systems requires addressing several complexities. Firstly, the constantly evolving nature of cyber threats means that the system must be able to adapt to new and unknown attacks. Secondly, the explainability of machine learning models is a difficult problem, as the models are often complex and opaque. Naive or straightforward approaches may fail to provide accurate and interpretable results, and technical obstacles such as the trade-off between accuracy and interpretability must be overcome.\n\n**[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?**\nThis problem has not been solved before because previous research has focused on developing machine learning models for intrusion detection without prioritizing explainability. Existing solutions often rely on static lists of known attacks, which are ineffective against novel threats. The development of explainable AI techniques is a relatively new field of study, and applying these techniques to intrusion detection systems is a challenging task.

We plan to use a dataset of network traffic and evaluate our approach using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

The increasing demand for dermatological care is exacerbated by the low\nperformance of general practitioners when diagnosing skin conditions [Federman et al., 1999], and by the global scarcity\nof expert dermatologists [Feng et al., 2018, Kringos et al., 2015].\nAutomation may help alleviate this problem. Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have been shown to achieve\nnear expert-level performance in diagnosing dermatological conditions from images of skin lesions [Thomsen et al.,\n2020, Esteva et al., 2017], and that they are able to assist general practitioners as well as less experienced dermatologists\nin improving their diagnostic performance [Tschandl et al., 2020, Jain et al., 2021]. However, the lack of a good\nexplanation mechanism [Kelly et al., 2019] for ConvNet decisions is one of the main obstacles to their adoption as\nautomated diagnosis systems [Goodman and Flaxman, 2017, Kelly et al., 2019, Topol, 2019]. A good explanation is\nexpected to be both plausible , i.e. as similar as possible to a human explanation, and faithful , i.e. to accurately represent\nthe inner workings of the network [Jacovi and Goldberg, 2020].\nDifferent mechanisms for explaining ConvNet decisions have been proposed [Simonyan et al., 2014, Selvaraju et al.,\n2017, Ribeiro et al., 2016].

After analyzing free-text explanations, they were formalized as an extended list of skin\nlesion characteristics [Nast et al., 2016].

The increasing demand for dermatological care is exacerbated by the low\nperformance of general practitioners when diagnosing skin conditions [Federman et al., 1999], and by the global scarcity\nof expert dermatologists [Feng et al., 2018, Kringos et al., 2015].\nAutomation may help alleviate this problem. Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have been shown to achieve\nnear expert-level performance in diagnosing dermatological conditions from images of skin lesions [Thomsen et al.,\n2020, Esteva et al., 2017], and that they are able to assist general practitioners as well as less experienced dermatologists\nin improving their diagnostic performance [Tschandl et al., 2020, Jain et al., 2021]. However, the lack of a good\nexplanation mechanism [Kelly et al., 2019] for ConvNet decisions is one of the main obstacles to their adoption as\nautomated diagnosis systems [Goodman and Flaxman, 2017, Kelly et al., 2019, Topol, 2019]. A good explanation is\nexpected to be both plausible , i.e. as similar as possible to a human explanation, and faithful , i.e. to accurately represent\nthe inner workings of the network [Jacovi and Goldberg, 2020].\nDifferent mechanisms for explaining ConvNet decisions have been proposed [Simonyan et al., 2014, Selvaraju et al.,\n2017, Ribeiro et al., 2016]. Within the medical imaging literature, the most common explainability Related work\nMachine learning-based dermatological diagnosis systems have been widely investigated, achieving experiments, we use an Ef\ufb01cientNet-B2 [Tan and Le, 2019] ConvNet pre-trained on\nthe ImageNet image recognition dataset [Deng et al., 2009] for feature extraction, with all layers \ufb01ne-tuned on the\nDermXDB data. Both models were trained for 93 epochs using the AdamW optimizer [Loshchilov and Hutter, 2018],\nthe cosine annealing with warm restarts learning rate scheduler [Loshchilov and Hutter, 2016], and a starting learning\nrate of 0.0005. Within the dense block we use linear layers with 64 neurons, dropout layers with 0.2 probability, and\nReLU activations. DermX is trained with \u0015D= 1,\u0015C= 1, while DermX+ uses \u0015D= 1,\u0015C= 1, and\u0015A= 10 .\nFurther information about the hyper-parameters used for training and other implementation details can be found in introduction of a structured ontology for\nthe diagnosis explanations to avoid manual processing of typos and synonyms.\nDiagnosis and explanation ontology Preliminary investigations also highlighted the importance of having a con-\nsistent explanation ontology. After analyzing free-text explanations, they were formalized as an extended list of skin\nlesion characteristics [Nast et al., 2016]. The characteristics set was selected to suf\ufb01ciently explain the six target\ndiseases [Oakley, 2017]. With the help of two senior dermatologists, several other relevant characteristics were added.\nThe resulting set of characteristics was split into non-localizable characteristics (e.g. age or sex), localizable charac-\nteristics (e.g. plaque or open comedo), and additional descriptive terms (e.g. red or well-circumscribed), according\nto the International League of Dermatological Societies\u2019 classi\ufb01cation [Nast et al., 2016]. Figure 3 illustrates the\n\ufb01nal DermXDB explanation taxonomy, while more information about the other two types of labels is available in Appendix Tables 18, 19, 20, and 21. DermX performs adequately well on all characteristics. DermX+\nis better at localizing large characteristics, e.g. patches or scales, but performs poorly on smaller characteristics, e.g.\nopen and closed comedones.\n\n            **Your Task**\n\n            1. **Literature Review**: Analyze the Introduction provided and conduct a brief literature review to understand the current state of research in this area.\n\n            2. **Brainstorming**: Collaboratively brainstorm potential research ideas that build upon or address gaps in the Introduction.\n\n            3. **Summarization**: Summarize your collective ideas.\n\n            4. **Formulate a New Research Idea**: Develop a new research proposal in the format of the '5q', defined below:\n\n               **Here is a high-level summarized insight of a research field Machine Learning.**\n\n               **Here are the five core questions:**\n\n               **[Question 1] - What is the problem?**\n\n               Formulate the specific research question you aim to address.

Furthermore, developing explainable ConvNets can increase trust in AI-powered diagnosis systems and facilitate their adoption in clinical practice, ultimately advancing the field of medical imaging and AI-assisted diagnosis.\",\n  \n  \"[Question 3] - Why is it hard?\": \"This problem is challenging because developing explainable ConvNets requires a deep understanding of both the underlying neural network architecture and the complex patterns in medical images. Additionally, the lack of standardization in explanation methods and the need for large, high-quality datasets of annotated medical images make it difficult to develop and evaluate explainable models. Naive approaches may fail due to the complexity of skin diseases, the variability in image quality, and the need for models to generalize across different populations and clinical settings.\",\n  \n  \"[Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?\": \"Previous research has focused on developing accurate ConvNets for skin disease diagnosis, but the lack of explainability has limited their adoption in clinical practice. Existing explanation methods are often simplistic, incomplete, or require significant manual annotation, making them impractical for large-scale deployment. Our approach differs from prior work by focusing on developing a comprehensive and standardized explanation framework that can be integrated with ConvNets, addressing the need for transparency and trust in AI-powered diagnosis systems.\",\n  \n  \"[Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?\": \"Our proposed methodology involves developing a novel explanation framework that combines attention mechanisms, feature importance, and ontology-based labeling to provide transparent and accurate explanations for ConvNet decisions. We will utilize a large dataset of annotated medical images, such as the DermXDB dataset, and evaluate our model using metrics such as accuracy, explainability, and clinical relevance.
