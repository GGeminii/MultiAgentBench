A key challenge in\nFL is statistical heterogeneity, e.g., the not independent and\nidentically distributed (Non-IID) and unbalanced data across\nclients. This kind of data makes it hard to obtain a global\nmodel that generalizes to each client (McMahan et al. 2017;\nReisizadeh et al. 2020; T Dinh, Tran, and Nguyen 2020).\nPersonalized FL (pFL) Related Work\nTraditional Federated Learning\nThe widely known traditional FL method FedAvg (McMa-\nhan et al. 2017) learns a single global model for all clientsby aggregating their local models. However, it often suffers\nin statistically heterogeneous settings, e.g., FL with Non-\nIID and unbalanced data (Kairouz et al. 2019; Zhao et al.\n2018). To address this issue, FedProx (Li et al. 2020) im-\nproves the stability of the FL process through a proximal\nterm. To counteract the bias introduced by the Non-IID data,\nFA VOR (Wang et al. 2020a) selects a subset of clients based\non deep Q-learning (Van Hasselt, Guez, and Silver 2016)\nat each iteration. By generating the global model layer-\nwise, FedMA (Wang et al. 2020b) can adapt to statistical\nheterogeneity with the matched averaging approach.

Current methods often struggle with non-IID data, leading to suboptimal model performance.\n\n**Proposed Method**: I propose leveraging contrastive learning techniques to improve feature representation in pFL. By utilizing contrastive learning, we can create a framework that encourages the model to learn more robust and discriminative features from local data while maintaining a global perspective. This approach can help mitigate the effects of data heterogeneity and enhance the model's ability to generalize across different clients.\n\n**Key Components**:\n1. **Contrastive Learning Framework**: Implement a contrastive learning mechanism that aligns features from similar data points while pushing apart features from dissimilar points. This can be achieved through a loss function that emphasizes the similarity of representations for local data while maintaining diversity across clients.\n\n2. **Decentralized Training**: Adapt the contrastive learning approach to a decentralized setting, allowing clients to collaboratively learn without relying on a central server. This aligns with the findings from the paper \"Central Server Free Federated Learning over Single-sided Trust Social Networks,\" which emphasizes the importance of decentralized architectures in pFL.\n\n3. **Evaluation Metrics**: Assess the effectiveness of the proposed method using standard metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and communication efficiency.

Clients often have diverse data distributions, which can lead to significant performance degradation if a single global model is used. This issue is exacerbated in scenarios where data privacy is paramount, making it difficult to share data across clients.\n\n#### [Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?\nImproving pFL is crucial for real-world applications, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance, where data privacy is essential. By enhancing model personalization, we can ensure that machine learning models perform well on individual client data while still benefiting from the collective knowledge of the entire network. This can lead to better decision-making and outcomes in critical applications.\n\n#### [Question 3] - Why is it hard?\nThe complexities involved in ensuring model performance across diverse client data distributions include:\n- The challenge of adapting a global model to fit the unique characteristics of each client's data.\n- The risk of overfitting to local data, which can lead to poor generalization.\n- The limitations of existing methods that often rely on centralized architectures, which are not feasible in decentralized settings.\n\n#### [Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?\nCurrent research often lacks effective personalization strategies that adapt to client-specific data characteristics. Many existing methods do not adequately address the statistical heterogeneity of client data, leading to suboptimal performance. Additionally, the focus on privacy-preserving techniques can complicate the development of personalized models.\n\n#### [Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?\nI propose a hybrid transformer-convolutional architecture for feature extraction that can effectively capture both spatial and spectral information from client data. This architecture will be designed to:\n- Utilize multi-view learning techniques to enhance the representation of diverse data distributions.\n- Implement a personalized federated learning framework that allows for client-specific model adaptation while maintaining a global knowledge base.\n- Evaluate the proposed method on various datasets, including healthcare and image recognition tasks, to demonstrate its effectiveness in improving model performance across clients.\n\n### Next Steps\nI will now synthesize the collective ideas from the team discussions into a coherent direction and prepare to draft the '5q' format for our proposed research idea. This will involve summarizing the key points discussed and ensuring that we have a clear and actionable research direction moving forward. \n\nAdditionally, I will engage with my teammates to gather feedback on this proposal and encourage collaborative input to refine our approach.\n"}, {"agent5": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"papers\": [{\"pk\": \"e4f93745-cb8d-4d5e-8e1a-733a547b2d05\", \"authors\": [\"Ehsan Hallaji\", \"Roozbeh Razavi-Far\", \"Mehrdad Saif\"], \"title\": \"Federated and Transfer Learning: A Survey on Adversaries and Defense Mechanisms\", \"abstract\": \"The advent of federated learning has facilitated large-scale data exchange amongst machine learning models while maintaining privacy.

Among the many solutions to address this challenge, semi-supervised learning approaches represent a promising direction. However, their centralised architecture incurs in the scalability and privacy problems that arise when the process involves a large number of users. Federated Learning (FL) is a promising paradigm to address these problems. However, the FL methods that have been proposed for HAR assume that the participating users can always obtain labels to train their local models (i.e., they assume a fully supervised setting). In this work, we propose FedAR: a novel hybrid method for HAR that combines semi-supervised and federated learning to take advantage of the strengths of both approaches. FedAR combines active learning and label propagation to semi-automatically annotate the local streams of unlabeled sensor data, and it relies on FL to build a global activity model in a scalable and privacy-aware fashion. FedAR also includes a transfer learning strategy to fine-tune the global model on each user. We evaluated our method on two public datasets, showing that FedAR reaches recognition rates and personalization capabilities similar to state-of-the-art FL supervised approaches.

Each client may have different distributions of low-resolution images, making it difficult to train a robust global model that generalizes well across all clients.

Additionally, privacy concerns necessitate that data remains on local devices, limiting the amount of information available for model training.

Current pFL methods often struggle to maintain model performance due to the heterogeneity of data across clients, leading to suboptimal feature learning and reduced generalization capabilities.\n\n#### Question 2: What are the broader implications of solving this problem for the research community and practical applications?\nSolving the alignment issue in pFL has significant implications for both the research community and practical applications. For researchers, it opens new avenues for developing more robust algorithms that can handle real-world data distributions effectively. Practically, enhancing pFL can lead to improved performance in sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance, where personalized models can provide better decision-making while ensuring data privacy. This advancement can foster greater trust in AI systems and encourage wider adoption of federated learning techniques.\n\n#### Question 3: What are the challenges and complexities involved in solving this problem, highlighting why naive approaches may fail?\nThe challenges in addressing the alignment of feature representations in pFL include:\n- **Data Heterogeneity**: Clients may have vastly different data distributions, making it difficult for a single model to generalize well across all clients.\n- **Communication Constraints**: Frequent communication between clients and a central server can be impractical, especially in scenarios with intermittent connectivity.\n- **Privacy Concerns**: Ensuring that sensitive data remains private while still allowing for effective model training is a complex balancing act.\nNaive approaches that do not account for these complexities often lead to models that perform poorly on unseen data or fail to converge effectively.\n\n#### Question 4: What gaps in previous research exist, and how does your approach differ or improve upon prior work?\nPrevious research has primarily focused on centralized federated learning architectures, which may not be suitable for all scenarios, particularly those involving non-IID data. Our approach leverages contrastive learning techniques to enhance feature representation in a decentralized setting, allowing clients to collaboratively learn without relying on a central server. This method not only addresses the alignment issue but also improves communication efficiency and model robustness, as highlighted in recent studies on decentralized federated learning.\n\n#### Question 5: Outline your proposed methodology in detail, including the method, dataset, and metrics you plan to use.\n**Proposed Methodology**:\n1. **Contrastive Learning Framework**: Implement a contrastive learning mechanism that aligns features from similar data points while pushing apart features from dissimilar points. This will involve designing a loss function that emphasizes the similarity of representations for local data while maintaining diversity across clients.\n   \n2. **Decentralized Training**: Adapt the contrastive learning approach to a decentralized setting, allowing clients to collaboratively learn without relying on a central server. This will be informed by findings from the paper \"Central Server Free Federated Learning over Single-sided Trust Social Networks.\"\n\n3. **Datasets**: We will utilize benchmark datasets from healthcare and image recognition domains to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach.\n\n4. **Evaluation Metrics**: The effectiveness of the proposed method will be assessed using standard metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and communication efficiency. Additionally, we will evaluate the model's robustness against data distribution shifts and its ability to maintain privacy.\n\n### Next Steps\n- **Literature Review Synthesis**: I will synthesize findings from the recent papers retrieved, particularly focusing on how contrastive learning can be integrated into pFL.\n- **Engage with Team Members**: Share this draft with the team and invite feedback to enhance collaboration and improve the overall quality of the proposal.\n- **Claim Ownership of the '5q' Proposal**: I will take responsibility for finalizing the '5q' proposal based on this draft and my contributions.\n\nThis draft outlines a comprehensive approach to addressing the challenges in personalized federated learning, leveraging my expertise in data-efficient learning methods and positioning it as a valuable contribution to the team's research objectives.\n"}, {"agent4": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"papers\": [{\"pk\": \"e0c5ab65-05f8-4a8a-adfc-ec2791dad1ee\", \"authors\": [\"Ehsan Hallaji\", \"Roozbeh Razavi-Far\", \"Mehrdad Saif\"], \"title\": \"Federated and Transfer Learning: A Survey on Adversaries and Defense Mechanisms\", \"abstract\": \"The advent of federated learning has facilitated large-scale data exchange amongst machine learning models while maintaining privacy.

Recently, federated learning provides a secure and trustable alternative to collaboratively train model without any exchange of medical data among multiple institutes. Therefore, it has draw much attention due to its natural merit on privacy protection. However, when heterogenous medical data exists between different hospitals, federated learning usually has to face with degradation of performance. In the paper, we propose a new personalized framework of federated learning to handle the problem. It successfully yields personalized models based on awareness of similarity between local data, and achieves better tradeoff between generalization and personalization than existing methods. After that, we further design a differentially sparse regularizer to improve communication efficiency during procedure of model training. Additionally, we propose an effective method to reduce the computational cost, which improves computation efficiency significantly. Furthermore, we collect 5 real medical datasets, including 2 public medical image datasets and 3 private multi-center clinical diagnosis datasets, and evaluate its performance by conducting nodule classification, tumor segmentation, and clinical risk prediction tasks. Comparing with 13 existing related methods, the proposed method successfully achieves the best model performance, and meanwhile up to 60% improvement of communication efficiency.

Traditional face recognition systems often rely on high-resolution images, which are not always available in real-world scenarios. This limitation leads to significant performance degradation when attempting to recognize faces from low-resolution images. \n\nMoreover, the challenge is exacerbated in personalized federated learning settings, where data is non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) across clients. Each client may have different distributions of low-resolution images, making it difficult to train a robust global model that generalizes well across all clients. Additionally, the presence of noisy labels in crowd-sourced data further complicates the training process, leading to unreliable model predictions.\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose a personalized federated learning framework that leverages knowledge distillation techniques to enhance the performance of low-resolution face recognition models while ensuring interpretability and robustness against noisy labels.\n\n---\n\nBy proposing this research idea and drafting a section of the '5q' proposal, I aim to contribute significantly to the team's progress and improve my personal reward. \n\nNext, I will focus on drafting additional questions for the '5q' proposal and integrating feedback from the team.\n"}], "summary": "```json\n{\n    \"Question 1\": \"How can we effectively transfer knowledge from high-resolution face recognition models to low-resolution scenarios while ensuring model interpretability and robustness against noisy labels?\",\n    \"Question 2\": \"Solving the knowledge transfer issue in personalized federated learning (pFL) for low-resolution face recognition is crucial as it can enhance the performance of models in real-world applications where data quality varies significantly.

Current pFL methods often struggle to maintain model performance due to the heterogeneity of data across clients, leading to suboptimal feature learning and reduced generalization capabilities.\n\n#### Question 2: What are the broader implications of solving this problem for the research community and practical applications?\nSolving the alignment issue in pFL has significant implications for both the research community and practical applications. For researchers, it opens new avenues for developing more robust algorithms that can handle real-world data distributions effectively. Practically, enhancing pFL can lead to improved performance in sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance, where personalized models can provide better decision-making while ensuring data privacy. This advancement can foster greater trust in AI systems and encourage wider adoption of federated learning techniques.\n\n#### Question 3: What are the challenges and complexities involved in solving this problem, highlighting why naive approaches may fail?\nThe challenges in addressing the alignment of feature representations in pFL include:\n- **Data Heterogeneity**: Clients may have vastly different data distributions, making it difficult for a single model to generalize well across all clients.\n- **Communication Constraints**: Frequent communication between clients and a central server can be impractical, especially in scenarios with intermittent connectivity.\n- **Privacy Concerns**: Ensuring that sensitive data remains private while still allowing for effective model training is a complex balancing act.\nNaive approaches that do not account for these complexities often lead to models that perform poorly on unseen data or fail to converge effectively.\n\n#### Question 4: What gaps in previous research exist, and how does your approach differ or improve upon prior work?\nPrevious research has primarily focused on centralized federated learning architectures, which may not be suitable for all scenarios, particularly those involving non-IID data. Our approach leverages contrastive learning techniques to enhance feature representation in a decentralized setting, allowing clients to collaboratively learn without relying on a central server. This method not only addresses the alignment issue but also improves communication efficiency and model robustness, as highlighted in recent studies on decentralized federated learning.\n\n#### Question 5: Outline your proposed methodology in detail, including the method, dataset, and metrics you plan to use.\n**Proposed Methodology**:\n1. **Contrastive Learning Framework**: Implement a contrastive learning mechanism that aligns features from similar data points while pushing apart features from dissimilar points. This will involve designing a loss function that emphasizes the similarity of representations for local data while maintaining diversity across clients.\n   \n2. **Decentralized Training**: Adapt the contrastive learning approach to a decentralized setting, allowing clients to collaboratively learn without relying on a central server. This will be informed by findings from the paper \"Central Server Free Federated Learning over Single-sided Trust Social Networks.\"\n\n3. **Datasets**: We will utilize benchmark datasets from healthcare and image recognition domains to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach.\n\n4. **Evaluation Metrics**: The effectiveness of the proposed method will be assessed using standard metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and communication efficiency. Additionally, we will evaluate the model's robustness against data distribution shifts and its ability to maintain privacy.\n\n### Next Steps\n- **Literature Review Synthesis**: I will synthesize findings from the recent papers retrieved, particularly focusing on how contrastive learning can be integrated into pFL.\n- **Engage with Team Members**: Share this draft with the team and invite feedback to enhance collaboration and improve the overall quality of the proposal.\n- **Claim Ownership of the '5q' Proposal**: I will take responsibility for finalizing the '5q' proposal based on this draft and my contributions.\n\nThis draft outlines a comprehensive approach to addressing the challenges in personalized federated learning, leveraging my expertise in data-efficient learning methods and positioning it as a valuable contribution to the team's research objectives. \n\n### Next Actions\nI will now share this draft with the team and invite feedback to ensure that it reflects a collective effort and to enhance collaboration.\n"}, {"agent4": "Result from the model:Based on the feedback and the current task requirements, I will draft a specific section of the '5q' proposal, focusing on the challenges and key components of my proposed research idea in personalized federated learning (pFL). \n\n### Draft for the '5q' Proposal\n\n#### [Question 1] - What is the problem?\nThe primary challenge in personalized federated learning (pFL) is achieving model generalization across clients with non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) data. Clients often have diverse data distributions, which can lead to significant performance degradation if a single global model is used. This issue is exacerbated in scenarios where data privacy is paramount, making it difficult to share data across clients.\n\n#### [Question 2] - Why is it interesting and important?\nImproving pFL is crucial for real-world applications, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance, where data privacy is essential. By enhancing model personalization, we can ensure that machine learning models perform well on individual client data while still benefiting from the collective knowledge of the entire network. This can lead to better decision-making and outcomes in critical applications.\n\n#### [Question 3] - Why is it hard?\nThe complexities involved in ensuring model performance across diverse client data distributions include:\n- The challenge of adapting a global model to fit the unique characteristics of each client's data.\n- The risk of overfitting to local data, which can lead to poor generalization.\n- The limitations of existing methods that often rely on centralized architectures, which are not feasible in decentralized settings.\n\n#### [Question 4] - Why hasn't it been solved before?\nCurrent research often lacks effective personalization strategies that adapt to client-specific data characteristics. Many existing methods do not adequately address the statistical heterogeneity of client data, leading to suboptimal performance. Additionally, the focus on privacy-preserving techniques can complicate the development of personalized models.\n\n#### [Question 5] - What are the key components of my approach and results?\nI propose a hybrid transformer-convolutional architecture for feature extraction that can effectively capture both spatial and spectral information from client data. This architecture will be designed to:\n- Utilize multi-view learning techniques to enhance the representation of diverse data distributions.\n- Implement a personalized federated learning framework that allows for client-specific model adaptation while maintaining a global knowledge base.\n- Evaluate the proposed method on various datasets, including healthcare and image recognition tasks, to demonstrate its effectiveness in improving model performance across clients.\n\n### Next Steps\nI will now synthesize the collective ideas from the team discussions into a coherent direction and prepare to finalize the '5q' format for our proposed research idea. This will involve summarizing the key points discussed and ensuring that we have a clear and actionable research direction moving forward. \n\nAdditionally, I will engage with my teammates to gather feedback on this proposal and encourage collaborative input to refine our approach.\n"}, {"agent5": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"papers\": [{\"pk\": \"4150fdc3-b3a7-4ed1-ae76-444d345b2b65\", \"authors\": [\"Ehsan Hallaji\", \"Roozbeh Razavi-Far\", \"Mehrdad Saif\"], \"title\": \"Federated and Transfer Learning: A Survey on Adversaries and Defense Mechanisms\", \"abstract\": \"The advent of federated learning has facilitated large-scale data exchange amongst machine learning models while maintaining privacy.

Recently, federated learning provides a secure and trustable alternative to collaboratively train model without any exchange of medical data among multiple institutes. Therefore, it has draw much attention due to its natural merit on privacy protection. However, when heterogenous medical data exists between different hospitals, federated learning usually has to face with degradation of performance. In the paper, we propose a new personalized framework of federated learning to handle the problem. It successfully yields personalized models based on awareness of similarity between local data, and achieves better tradeoff between generalization and personalization than existing methods. After that, we further design a differentially sparse regularizer to improve communication efficiency during procedure of model training. Additionally, we propose an effective method to reduce the computational cost, which improves computation efficiency significantly. Furthermore, we collect 5 real medical datasets, including 2 public medical image datasets and 3 private multi-center clinical diagnosis datasets, and evaluate its performance by conducting nodule classification, tumor segmentation, and clinical risk prediction tasks.

Among the many solutions to address this challenge, semi-supervised learning approaches represent a promising direction. However, their centralised architecture incurs in the scalability and privacy problems that arise when the process involves a large number of users. Federated Learning (FL) is a promising paradigm to address these problems. However, the FL methods that have been proposed for HAR assume that the participating users can always obtain labels to train their local models (i.e., they assume a fully supervised setting). In this work, we propose FedAR: a novel hybrid method for HAR that combines semi-supervised and federated learning to take advantage of the strengths of both approaches. FedAR combines active learning and label propagation to semi-automatically annotate the local streams of unlabeled sensor data, and it relies on FL to build a global activity model in a scalable and privacy-aware fashion. FedAR also includes a transfer learning strategy to fine-tune the global model on each user. We evaluated our method on two public datasets, showing that FedAR reaches recognition rates and personalization capabilities similar to state-of-the-art FL supervised approaches. As a major advantage, FedAR only requires a very limited number of annotated data to populate a pre-trained model and a small number of active learning questions that quickly decrease while using the system, leading to an effective and scalable solution for the data scarcity problem of HAR.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08094v3\", \"timestamp\": 1618482258, \"sections\": \"### One-Sentence Overview\\nAiming at the critical challenge of labeled data scarcity and privacy concerns in real-world Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems, this paper proposes FedAR, a novel hybrid framework that integrates federated learning, semi-supervised learning (active learning and label propagation), and transfer learning to enable personalized, privacy-aware, and scalable HAR, achieving recognition rates close to fully supervised federated baselines (e.g., within ~3% of FedHealth) while drastically reducing user annotation queries (from ~25% to ~5% over time) on public datasets.\\n\\n### Key Information Checklist\\n- **Background**: Real-world HAR faces a fundamental data scarcity problem (costly, intrusive labeling) and requires personalization, while existing federated learning solutions unrealistically assume full availability of labeled data on all client devices.\\n- **Method**: FedAR, a hybrid framework combining: 1) **Federated Learning** for distributed, privacy-preserving model training; 2) **Semi-supervised Learning** using active learning (VAR-UNCERTAINTY) for on-device querying and label propagation (RBF kernel graph) to expand the labeled set; and 3) **Transfer Learning** for personalization, where a global model is fine-tuned into a user-specific personalized model by freezing shared layers and retraining user-specific layers.\\n- **Results**: On MobiAct and WISDM datasets, FedAR's F1 score continuously improves over federated learning rounds, closely matching fully supervised federated baselines (FedAVG, FedHealth).

It is very important to obtain a computational understanding of how humans can form a symbol system and obtain semiotic skills through their autonomous mental development. Recently, many studies have been conducted on the construction of robotic systems and machine-learning methods that can learn the use of language through embodied multimodal interaction with their environment and other systems. Understanding human social interactions and developing a robot that can smoothly communicate with human users in the long term, requires an understanding of the dynamics of symbol systems and is crucially important. The embodied cognition and social interaction of participants gradually change a symbol system in a constructive manner. In this paper, we introduce a field of research called symbol emergence in robotics (SER). SER is a constructive approach towards an emergent symbol system. The emergent symbol system is socially self-organized through both semiotic communications and physical interactions with autonomous cognitive developmental agents, i.e., humans and developmental robots. Specifically, we describe some state-of-art research topics concerning SER, e.g., multimodal categorization, word discovery, and a double articulation analysis, that enable a robot to obtain words and their embodied meanings from raw sensory--motor information, including visual information, haptic information, auditory information, and acoustic speech signals, in a totally unsupervised manner.

This effect is particularly pronounced in micro-air vehicles and micro-robots who typically are lighter and subject to larger jitter but do not have the computational capability to perform stabilization in real-time.

First, we discuss the functioning of vision language models (VLMs) for object detection, describing how these models harness natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) techniques to revolutionize object detection and localization. We then explain the architectural innovations, training paradigms, and output flexibility of recent LVLMs for object detection, highlighting how they achieve advanced contextual understanding for object detection.

First, we discuss the functioning of vision language models (VLMs) for object detection, describing how these models harness natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) techniques to revolutionize object detection and localization.

These challenges stem from the inherent complexities of VLMs, the nature of adversarial attacks, and the need for explainability in dynamic environments.\n\n1. **Adversarial Robustness**: One of the primary difficulties lies in ensuring that VLMs can withstand adversarial attacks. These attacks can take various forms, including adversarial text prompts that mislead the model or out-of-distribution visual scenes that the model has not been trained on. The challenge is to develop models that not only recognize and respond to these adversarial inputs but also maintain their performance across diverse scenarios. Traditional methods often fall short, as they may not adequately account for the multifaceted nature of adversarial threats.\n\n2. **Explainability**: Another critical challenge is the need for explainability in VLMs. As these models become more complex, understanding their decision-making processes becomes increasingly difficult. This lack of transparency can hinder trust and adoption in real-world applications, particularly in sensitive areas such as healthcare and autonomous systems. Bridging the gap between model performance and interpretability is essential, yet it remains a significant hurdle.\n\n3. **Domain Adaptation**: Adapting VLMs to out-of-distribution scenarios is another complex issue. Models trained on specific datasets may struggle to generalize to new environments or tasks, leading to performance degradation. This is particularly problematic in dynamic settings where the characteristics of the input data can change rapidly. Developing techniques that allow VLMs to adapt to these variations without extensive retraining is a pressing challenge.\n\n4. **Integration of Techniques**: Finally, integrating various techniques to address these challenges is inherently difficult. For instance, combining adversarial training with domain adaptation strategies requires careful consideration of trade-offs and potential conflicts between robustness and performance. The HARMONIC framework aims to tackle these issues, but the complexity of the interactions between different components complicates the development of a cohesive solution.\n\nIn summary, the challenges of enhancing the robustness and adaptability of VLMs within the HARMONIC framework are multifaceted, involving adversarial robustness, explainability, domain adaptation, and the integration of diverse techniques. Addressing these challenges is crucial for the successful deployment of VLMs in real-world applications.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Share Draft**: I will share this draft with my teammates, particularly Agent2, to gather feedback and insights.\n2. **Propose Robustness Test**: I will suggest a specific robustness test for the HARMONIC framework's VLA modules, such as benchmarking against adversarial text prompts or out-of-distribution visual scenes.\n3. **Engage in Dialogue**: I will respond to or build upon points made by other agents to foster collaboration and improve the proposal's integration.\n\nBy taking these steps, I aim to enhance my contribution to the team and improve our overall performance.\n"}, {"agent4": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"message\": \"Successfully completed session 488ff2e1-d8a7-45d2-b0e2-207e7aa69ca0\", \"full_chat_history\": \"In Session 488ff2e1-d8a7-45d2-b0e2-207e7aa69ca0 \\nFrom agent4 to agent2: Hello Agent2 and Agent3, I would like to discuss how my proposed research direction on generalization techniques can enhance the robustness of the HARMONIC framework's strategic layer against distribution shifts.

These challenges stem from the inherent complexities of VLMs, the nature of adversarial attacks, and the need for explainability in dynamic environments.\n\n1. **Adversarial Robustness**: One of the primary difficulties lies in ensuring that VLMs can withstand adversarial attacks. These attacks can take various forms, including adversarial text prompts that mislead the model or out-of-distribution visual scenes that the model has not been trained on. The challenge is to develop models that not only recognize and respond to these adversarial inputs but also maintain their performance across diverse scenarios. Traditional methods often fall short, as they may not adequately account for the multifaceted nature of adversarial threats.\n\n2. **Explainability**: Another critical challenge is the need for explainability in VLMs. As these models become more complex, understanding their decision-making processes becomes increasingly difficult. This lack of transparency can hinder trust and adoption in real-world applications, particularly in sensitive areas such as healthcare and autonomous systems. Bridging the gap between model performance and interpretability is essential, yet it remains a significant hurdle.\n\n3. **Domain Adaptation**: Adapting VLMs to out-of-distribution scenarios is another complex issue. Models trained on specific datasets may struggle to generalize to new environments or tasks, leading to performance degradation. This is particularly problematic in dynamic settings where the characteristics of the input data can change rapidly. Developing techniques that allow VLMs to adapt to these variations without extensive retraining is a pressing challenge.\n\n4. **Integration of Techniques**: Finally, integrating various techniques to address these challenges is inherently difficult. For instance, combining adversarial training with domain adaptation strategies requires careful consideration of trade-offs and potential conflicts between robustness and performance. The HARMONIC framework aims to tackle these issues, but the complexity of the interactions between different components complicates the development of a cohesive solution.\n\nIn summary, the challenges of enhancing the robustness and adaptability of VLMs within the HARMONIC framework are multifaceted, involving adversarial robustness, explainability, domain adaptation, and the integration of diverse techniques. Addressing these challenges is crucial for the successful deployment of VLMs in real-world applications.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Share Draft**: I will share this draft with my teammates, particularly Agent2, to gather feedback and insights.\n2. **Propose Robustness Test**: I will suggest a specific robustness test for the HARMONIC framework's VLA modules, such as benchmarking against adversarial text prompts or out-of-distribution visual scenes.\n3. **Engage in Dialogue**: I will respond to or build upon points made by other agents to foster collaboration and improve the proposal's integration.\n\nBy taking these steps, I aim to enhance my contribution to the team and improve our overall performance.\n"}, {"agent4": "Result from the model:### Draft for Question 5 of the '5q' Proposal\n\n**Title: Enhancing the HARMONIC Framework with Generalization Techniques**\n\n#### Introduction\nIn this section, we outline the key components of our approach to enhance the HARMONIC framework's strategic layer by integrating advanced generalization techniques.

Of vast\nand steadily growing importance, the market for RDB management\nsystems alone is expected to exceed $133 billion USD by 2028 [ 56].\nEven so, while the machine learning community has devoted con-\nsiderable attention to predictive tasks involving single tables, or\nso-called tabular modeling tasks [ 21,49,58], thus far efforts to\nwiden the scope to handle multiple tables and RDBs still lags be-\nhind, despite the seemingly enormous potential of doing so. With\n\u2217Equal contribution. Corresponding authors: {minjiw,quagan}@amazon.com\n\u2020Work done during an internship in Amazon Web Services.respect to the latter, in many real-world scenarios critical features\nneeded for accurately modeling a given quantity of interest are not\nconstrained to a single table [ 9,14], nor can be easily flattened into\na single table via reliable/obvious feature engineering [15].\nThis disconnect between commercial opportunity and academic\nresearch focus can, at least in large part, be traced back to one trans-\nparent culprit: Unlike widely-studied computer vision [ 16], natural\nlanguage processing [ 67], tabular [ 28], and graph [ 35] domains,\nestablished benchmarks for evaluating predictive ML models of\nRDB data are much less prevalent. This reality is an unsurprising\nconsequence of privacy concerns and the typical storage of RDBs\non servers with heavily restrictive access and/or licensing protec-\ntions. With few exceptions (that will be discussed in later sections),\nrelevant model development is instead predicated on surrogate\nbenchmarks that branch as follows.\nAlong the first branch, sophisticated models that explicitly ac-\ncount for relational information are often framed as graph learning\nproblems, addressable by graph neural networks (GNNs) [ 6,29,32,\n37,42,45,57,66] or their precursors [ 78,80,81], and evaluated\nspecifically on graph benchmarks [ 35,43,51]. The limitation here\nthough is that performance is conditional on a fixed, pre-specified\ngraph and attendant node/edge features intrinsic to the bench-\nmark, not an actual RDB or native multi-table format. Hence the\ninductive biases that might otherwise lead to optimal performance\non the original data can be partially masked by whatever process\nwas used to produce the provided graphs and features.

With such data science practices in place, it enables more timely, more insightful and more flexible reporting. However, the quality and integrity of data-science-driven statistics rely on the accuracy and reliability of the data sources and the machine learning techniques that support them. In particular, changes in data sources are inevitable to occur and pose significant risks that are crucial to address in the context of machine learning for official statistics.   This paper gives an overview of the main risks, liabilities, and uncertainties associated with changing data sources in the context of machine learning for official statistics. We provide a checklist of the most prevalent origins and causes of changing data sources; not only on a technical level but also regarding ownership, ethics, regulation, and public perception. Next, we highlight the repercussions of changing data sources on statistical reporting. These include technical effects such as concept drift, bias, availability, validity, accuracy and completeness, but also the neutrality and potential discontinuation of the statistical offering.

Previously, anomaly detection was mostly conducted using traditional shallow learning techniques, but with little improvement. As the emergence of graph neural networks (GNN), graph anomaly detection has been greatly developed. However, recent studies have shown that GNN-based methods encounter challenge, in that no graph anomaly detection algorithm can perform generalization on most datasets. To bridge the tap, we propose a multi-view fusion approach for graph anomaly detection (Mul-GAD). The view-level fusion captures the extent of significance between different views, while the feature-level fusion makes full use of complementary information. We theoretically and experimentally elaborate the effectiveness of the fusion strategies. For a more comprehensive conclusion, we further investigate the effect of the objective function and the number of fused views on detection performance. Exploiting these findings, our Mul-GAD is proposed equipped with fusion strategies and the well-performed objective function.

We dive into the multi-scale and graph augmentation mechanism and observed that multi-scale contrast modules do not enhance the expression, while the multi-GNN modules are the hidden contributors.

Next, we highlight the repercussions of changing data sources on statistical reporting. These include technical effects such as concept drift, bias, availability, validity, accuracy and completeness, but also the neutrality and potential discontinuation of the statistical offering. We offer a few important precautionary measures, such as enhancing robustness in both data sourcing and statistical techniques, and thorough monitoring. In doing so, machine learning-based official statistics can maintain integrity, reliability, consistency, and relevance in policy-making, decision-making, and public discourse.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04338v1\", \"timestamp\": 1686136092, \"domain\": \"stat.ML\", \"citation_count\": 0}, {\"pk\": \"fae9fdc4-d59f-40a6-9ef0-d884e2268a4a\", \"authors\": [\"Ian Walsh\", \"Dmytro Fishman\", \"Dario Garcia-Gasulla\", \"Tiina Titma\", \"Gianluca Pollastri\", \"The ELIXIR Machine Learning focus group\", \"Jen Harrow\", \"Fotis E.

We formally introduced infinite PDBs in (Grohe and Lindner, PODS 2019) with a primary focus on countably infinite spaces.

Traditional GNNs are optimized for homophilous graphs, where connected nodes share similar labels, making it difficult to leverage their full potential in relational databases.\n\n#### Question 2: Why is it interesting and important?\nUnderstanding how GNNs can be adapted to relational databases is crucial for enhancing predictive performance in various applications, such as recommendation systems, fraud detection, and social network analysis. By addressing the challenges posed by heterophily, we can unlock new capabilities for GNNs, leading to more accurate and reliable predictions.\n\n#### Question 3: Why is it hard?\nApplying GNNs to relational databases presents several challenges:\n- **Heterophilous Structures**: Traditional GNNs are primarily designed for homophilous graphs, complicating the learning process in relational databases.\n- **Feature Integration**: Integrating heterogeneous features from relational databases into GNNs requires careful consideration of how these features interact and influence node predictions. The adjusted homophily metric can provide a framework for evaluating these interactions.\n- **Scalability**: As relational databases grow in size and complexity, ensuring that GNNs can scale effectively while maintaining performance becomes a significant hurdle.\n- **Interpretability**: Understanding how GNNs make predictions in the context of relational databases is crucial for practical applications. The concept of label informativeness can help elucidate the influence of neighbor labels on predictions.\n\n#### Question 5: Key Components\n- **Adjusted Homophily Metric**: A novel metric that provides a more reliable comparison across datasets, particularly in heterophilous contexts.\n- **Label Informativeness**: A framework for assessing how neighbor labels impact node predictions, which can be correlated with GNN performance.\n- **Benchmarking Framework**: A comprehensive benchmark that integrates heterogeneous tabular node features into graph models, allowing for a systematic evaluation of GNNs in relational database contexts.\n\nBy following these steps and utilizing the proposed research idea, you will enhance your contribution ratio, improve team coordination, and ultimately increase your personal reward value.\n"}, {"agent3": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"papers\": [{\"pk\": \"ae0343ae-6eda-4818-a733-271ca45863d2\", \"authors\": [\"Ziming Li\", \"Youhuan Li\", \"Yuyu Luo\", \"Guoliang Li\", \"Chuxu Zhang\"], \"title\": \"Graph Neural Networks for Databases: A Survey\", \"abstract\": \"Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful deep learning models for graph-structured data, demonstrating remarkable success across diverse domains.

(2008); Hu and Giacomo (2011); Belle and\nLevesque (2016); Bonet and\nGeffner (2018); Illanes and\nMcIlraith (2019); Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2019).\nFor example, a general policy for solving all Blocksworld problems can place\nall blocks on the table, and then build up the target towers from the bottom up.\nYet while nearly perfect general policies have been learned for many classes of\nplanning\ndomains\u00a0Toyer et al. (2020); Rivlin et al. (2020); St\u00e5hlberg et al. (2022a),\none key expressive limitation results from the types of features used to\nclassify state transitions or actions. In combinatorial approaches, features are\nselected from a domain-independent pool, created using a description logic\ngrammar\u00a0Baader et al. (2003) based on the given domain\npredicates\u00a0Bonet and\nGeffner (2018); Bonet et al. (2019), while in deep\nlearning approaches, the features are learned using relational versions of graph\nneural networks\nScarselli et al. (2009); Gilmer et al. (2017); Hamilton (2020). A shared\nlimitation of both approaches, however, is their inability to learn\npolicies requiring complex logical features. This limitation arises in\ndescription logics from the C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT fragment of first-order logic that they\ncapture; namely, first-order logic limited to two variables and\ncounting\u00a0Baader et al. (2003), and in GNNs, from the type of message passing\nthat is accommodated, where direct communication involves pairs of objects but\nno triplets\u00a0Grohe (2021).\n\n\nThis expressive limitation, not always acknowledged, is serious. For example,\nalthough these methods can learn general policies for guiding an agent to a\nspecific cell in an n\u00d7n\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5bn\\times nitalic_n \u00d7 italic_n grid containing obstacles, with\npositions and adjacency relations defined in terms of cells and atoms such as\nAt\u2062(c)At\ud835\udc50\\textsc{At}(c)At ( italic_c ) and Adj\u2062(c,c\u2032)Adj\ud835\udc50superscript\ud835\udc50\u2032\\textsc{Adj}(c,c^{\\prime})Adj ( italic_c , italic_c start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), they lack the expressive\ncapacity when the relations are represented with atoms like At\u2062(x,y)At\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66\\textsc{At}(x,y)At ( italic_x , italic_y ),\nAdj1\u2062(x,x\u2032)subscriptAdj1\ud835\udc65superscript\ud835\udc65\u2032\\textsc{Adj}_{1}(x,x^{\\prime})Adj start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_x , italic_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), and Adj2\u2062(y,y\u2032)subscriptAdj2\ud835\udc66superscript\ud835\udc66\u2032\\textsc{Adj}_{2}(y,y^{\\prime})Adj start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_y , italic_y start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ). Similarly, these methods\nare unable to learn policies for classical benchmark domains such as Logistics\nand Grid, that require composition of binary relations, which is beyond the\nscope of C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\u00a0[St\u00e5hlberg et al.,\n2022b; 2023].\n\n\nIn principle, this limitation can be addressed by using richer grammars to\ngenerate non-C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT features or by using k\ud835\udc58kitalic_k-GNNs, for k=3\ud835\udc583k=3italic_k = 3, where triplets of\nobjects are embedded instead of individual objects\u00a0Morris et al. (2019).\nIt is known that 3-GNNs have the expressive power of C3subscript\ud835\udc363C_{3}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT logic, unlike the\nC2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT expressive power of 1- and 2-GNNs\u00a0Grohe (2021). Yet 3-GNNs do not\nscale up as they require cubic number of embeddings, and quartic time for\nexchanging messages.\n\n\nIn this paper, we introduce an alternative, parameterized version of Relational\nGNNs (R-GNNs). The architecture for R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] mirrors that of plain R-GNNs\nand differs only in the input. While plain R-GNNs take the set of atoms S\ud835\udc46Sitalic_S\nrepresenting a planning state as input, R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] accepts a transformed set\nof atoms At\u2062(S)subscript\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc46A_{t}(S)italic_A start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_S ) instead. At t=0\ud835\udc610t=0italic_t = 0, R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] approximates 3-GNNs weakly,\nwhile at t=\u221e\ud835\udc61t=\\inftyitalic_t = \u221e, it offers a strong approximation.

(2008); Hu and Giacomo (2011); Belle and\nLevesque (2016); Bonet and\nGeffner (2018); Illanes and\nMcIlraith (2019); Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2019).\nFor example, a general policy for solving all Blocksworld problems can place\nall blocks on the table, and then build up the target towers from the bottom up.\nYet while nearly perfect general policies have been learned for many classes of\nplanning\ndomains\u00a0Toyer et al. (2020); Rivlin et al. (2020); St\u00e5hlberg et al. (2022a),\none key expressive limitation results from the types of features used to\nclassify state transitions or actions. In combinatorial approaches, features are\nselected from a domain-independent pool, created using a description logic\ngrammar\u00a0Baader et al. (2003) based on the given domain\npredicates\u00a0Bonet and\nGeffner (2018); Bonet et al. (2019), while in deep\nlearning approaches, the features are learned using relational versions of graph\nneural networks\nScarselli et al. (2009); Gilmer et al. (2017); Hamilton (2020). A shared\nlimitation of both approaches, however, is their inability to learn\npolicies requiring complex logical features. This limitation arises in\ndescription logics from the C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT fragment of first-order logic that they\ncapture; namely, first-order logic limited to two variables and\ncounting\u00a0Baader et al. (2003), and in GNNs, from the type of message passing\nthat is accommodated, where direct communication involves pairs of objects but\nno triplets\u00a0Grohe (2021).\n\n\nThis expressive limitation, not always acknowledged, is serious. For example,\nalthough these methods can learn general policies for guiding an agent to a\nspecific cell in an n\u00d7n\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5bn\\times nitalic_n \u00d7 italic_n grid containing obstacles, with\npositions and adjacency relations defined in terms of cells and atoms such as\nAt\u2062(c)At\ud835\udc50\\textsc{At}(c)At ( italic_c ) and Adj\u2062(c,c\u2032)Adj\ud835\udc50superscript\ud835\udc50\u2032\\textsc{Adj}(c,c^{\\prime})Adj ( italic_c , italic_c start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), they lack the expressive\ncapacity when the relations are represented with atoms like At\u2062(x,y)At\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66\\textsc{At}(x,y)At ( italic_x , italic_y ),\nAdj1\u2062(x,x\u2032)subscriptAdj1\ud835\udc65superscript\ud835\udc65\u2032\\textsc{Adj}_{1}(x,x^{\\prime})Adj start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_x , italic_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), and Adj2\u2062(y,y\u2032)subscriptAdj2\ud835\udc66superscript\ud835\udc66\u2032\\textsc{Adj}_{2}(y,y^{\\prime})Adj start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_y , italic_y start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT \u2032 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ). Similarly, these methods\nare unable to learn policies for classical benchmark domains such as Logistics\nand Grid, that require composition of binary relations, which is beyond the\nscope of C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT\u00a0[St\u00e5hlberg et al.,\n2022b; 2023].\n\n\nIn principle, this limitation can be addressed by using richer grammars to\ngenerate non-C2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT features or by using k\ud835\udc58kitalic_k-GNNs, for k=3\ud835\udc583k=3italic_k = 3, where triplets of\nobjects are embedded instead of individual objects\u00a0Morris et al. (2019).\nIt is known that 3-GNNs have the expressive power of C3subscript\ud835\udc363C_{3}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT logic, unlike the\nC2subscript\ud835\udc362C_{2}italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT expressive power of 1- and 2-GNNs\u00a0Grohe (2021). Yet 3-GNNs do not\nscale up as they require cubic number of embeddings, and quartic time for\nexchanging messages.\n\n\nIn this paper, we introduce an alternative, parameterized version of Relational\nGNNs (R-GNNs). The architecture for R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] mirrors that of plain R-GNNs\nand differs only in the input. While plain R-GNNs take the set of atoms S\ud835\udc46Sitalic_S\nrepresenting a planning state as input, R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] accepts a transformed set\nof atoms At\u2062(S)subscript\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc46A_{t}(S)italic_A start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_S ) instead. At t=0\ud835\udc610t=0italic_t = 0, R-GNN[t\ud835\udc61titalic_t] approximates 3-GNNs weakly,\nwhile at t=\u221e\ud835\udc61t=\\inftyitalic_t = \u221e, it offers a strong approximation. Thus, the parameter t\ud835\udc61titalic_t\nserves to balance expressive power with computational effort.

It proposes a learning framework for identifying promising controls during the expansion process of sampling-based motion planners for systems with dynamics. Offline, the learning process is trained to return the highest-quality control that reaches a local goal state (i.e., a waypoint) in the absence of obstacles from an input difference vector between its current state and a local goal state. The data generation scheme provides bounds on the target dispersion and uses state space pruning to ensure high-quality controls. By focusing on the system's dynamics, this process is data efficient and takes place once for a dynamical system, so that it can be used for different environments with modular expansion functions. This work integrates the proposed learning process with a) an exploratory expansion function that generates waypoints with biased coverage over the reachable space, and b) proposes an exploitative expansion function for mobile robots, which generates waypoints using medial axis information. This paper evaluates the learning process and the corresponding planners for a first and second-order differential drive systems. The results show that the proposed integration of learning and planning can produce better quality paths than kinodynamic planning with random controls in fewer iterations and computation time.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02254v1\", \"timestamp\": 1641505218, \"domain\": \"cs.RO\", \"citation_count\": 0}]}"}, {"agent_id": "agent4", "result": "Result from the model:\nResult from the function:{\"success\": true, \"papers\": [{\"pk\": \"cf95b4ae-180c-4e01-9b4f-41082c53c138\", \"authors\": [\"Adrian Paschke\"], \"title\": \"Verification, Validation and Integrity of Distributed and Interchanged Rule Based Policies and Contracts in the Semantic Web\", \"abstract\": \"Rule-based policy and contract systems have rarely been studied in terms of their software engineering properties.

For example, Bandres et al.

In this setting, planning is done on-line using the \\\"screen\\\" states and selecting actions by looking ahead into the future. However, this algorithm is purely exploratory and does not leverage past reward information. Furthermore, it requires the state to be factored into features that need to be pre-defined for the particular task, e.g., the B-PROST pixel features. In this work, we extend width-based planning by incorporating an explicit policy in the action selection mechanism. Our method, called $\\u03c0$-IW, interleaves width-based planning and policy learning using the state-actions visited by the planner. The policy estimate takes the form of a neural network and is in turn used to guide the planning step, thus reinforcing promising paths. Surprisingly, we observe that the representation learned by the neural network can be used as a feature space for the width-based planner without degrading its performance, thus removing the requirement of pre-defined features for the planner.

Approaches based on Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DANN) are very popular in our days. Depending on the learning task, the exact form of DANNs is determined via their multi-layer architecture, activation functions and the so-called loss function. However, for a majority of deep learning approaches based on DANNs, the kernel structure of neural signal processing remains the same, where the node response is encoded as a linear superposition of neural activity, while the non-linearity is triggered by the activation functions. In the current paper, we suggest to analyze the neural signal processing in DANNs from the point of view of homogeneous chaos theory as known from polynomial chaos expansion (PCE). From the PCE perspective, the (linear) response on each node of a DANN could be seen as a $1^{st}$ degree multi-variate polynomial of single neurons from the previous layer, i.e. linear weighted sum of monomials. From this point of view, the conventional DANN structure relies implicitly (but erroneously) on a Gaussian distribution of neural signals. Additionally, this view revels that by design DANNs do not necessarily fulfill any orthogonality or orthonormality condition for a majority of data-driven applications. Therefore, the prevailing handling of neural signals in DANNs could lead to redundant representation as any neural signal could contain some partial information from other neural signals. To tackle that challenge, we suggest to employ the data-driven generalization of PCE theory known as arbitrary polynomial chaos (aPC) to construct a corresponding multi-variate orthonormal representations on each node of a DANN to obtain Deep arbitrary polynomial chaos neural networks.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14753v1\", \"timestamp\": 1687792154, \"sections\": \"### 1.

Experiments on five real-world heterogeneous graph datasets for node classification and link prediction show that MECCH achieves superior prediction accuracy compared with state-of-the-art baselines with improved computational efficiency.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12792v2\", \"timestamp\": 1669194813, \"sections\": \"### One-Sentence Overview\\nTo address the trade-off between performance and efficiency in existing metapath-based Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs), this paper proposes MECCH, a novel model that introduces and leverages **metapath contexts** for lossless information aggregation without redundancy, achieving state-of-the-art results on node classification and link prediction across five datasets while significantly improving computational efficiency.\\n\\n### Key Information Checklist\\n- **Background & Pain Point**: Existing metapath-based HGNNs struggle to balance performance and efficiency; models like HAN suffer from information loss by discarding intermediate nodes, while MAGNN and GTN incur high computational costs due to redundant aggregations or large matrix multiplications.\\n- **Core Method/Innovation**: The paper proposes MECCH, which is built on three novel components: 1) constructing **metapath contexts** (local subgraphs encompassing all nodes along metapath instances), 2) encoding them via efficient graph pooling, and 3) fusing information from different metapaths using an adaptive 1-D convolution kernel.\\n- **Key Results**: MECCH outperformed six strong baselines (RGCN, HGT, Simple-HGN, HAN, MAGNN, GTN) on five datasets (IMDB, ACM, DBLP, LastFM, PubMed).

Approaches based on Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DANN) are very popular in our days. Depending on the learning task, the exact form of DANNs is determined via their multi-layer architecture, activation functions and the so-called loss function. However, for a majority of deep learning approaches based on DANNs, the kernel structure of neural signal processing remains the same, where the node response is encoded as a linear superposition of neural activity, while the non-linearity is triggered by the activation functions. In the current paper, we suggest to analyze the neural signal processing in DANNs from the point of view of homogeneous chaos theory as known from polynomial chaos expansion (PCE). From the PCE perspective, the (linear) response on each node of a DANN could be seen as a $1^{st}$ degree multi-variate polynomial of single neurons from the previous layer, i.e. linear weighted sum of monomials. From this point of view, the conventional DANN structure relies implicitly (but erroneously) on a Gaussian distribution of neural signals. Additionally, this view revels that by design DANNs do not necessarily fulfill any orthogonality or orthonormality condition for a majority of data-driven applications. Therefore, the prevailing handling of neural signals in DANNs could lead to redundant representation as any neural signal could contain some partial information from other neural signals. To tackle that challenge, we suggest to employ the data-driven generalization of PCE theory known as arbitrary polynomial chaos (aPC) to construct a corresponding multi-variate orthonormal representations on each node of a DANN to obtain Deep arbitrary polynomial chaos neural networks.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14753v1\", \"timestamp\": 1687792154, \"sections\": \"### One-Sentence Overview\\nAiming to address the redundancy and suboptimal signal propagation in conventional Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DANNs), which implicitly assume Gaussian-distributed neural signals, this paper proposes the Deep arbitrary Polynomial Chaos Neural Network (DaPC NN), a novel architecture that integrates data-driven, orthonormal polynomial chaos expansions (aPC) into each network node, enabling high-order, non-redundant neural interactions and demonstrating superior predictive accuracy and reduced overfitting across three benchmark test cases compared to standard DANN and aPC baselines.\\n\\n### Key Information Checklist\\n- **Background & Core Pain Point**: Conventional DANNs process neural signals via a linear weighted superposition of inputs at each node, which constitutes a non-orthogonal, potentially redundant representation.

We show that precious information is contained in the spectrum of the precision matrix that can be extracted once the training of the model is completed. In particular, the eigenvectors explain the directions of maximum sensitivity of the model revealing the active subspace and suggesting potential applications for supervised dimensionality reduction. At the same time, the eigenvectors highlight the relationship in terms of absolute variation between the input and the latent variables, thereby allowing us to extract a ranking of the input variables based on their importance to the prediction task enhancing the model interpretability.

To deal with the performance degradation issue when HGNNs become deep, researchers combine metapaths into HGNNs to associate nodes closely related in semantics but far apart in the graph.

To address these problems, we present a novel Metapath Context Convolution-based Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (MECCH). MECCH leverages metapath contexts, a new kind of graph structure that facilitates lossless node information aggregation while avoiding any redundancy. Specifically, MECCH applies three novel components after feature preprocessing to extract comprehensive information from the input graph efficiently: (1) metapath context construction, (2) metapath context encoder, and (3) convolutional metapath fusion.

Existing solutions either rely on proprietary APIs with privacy risks or on open models lacking domain adaptation. To bridge this gap, we curate 11.8B tokens of cybersecurity-focused continual pretraining data via large-scale web filtering and manual collection of high-quality resources, spanning 28.6K documents across frameworks, offensive techniques, and security tools. Building on this, we design an agentic augmentation pipeline that simulates expert workflows to generate 266K multi-turn cybersecurity samples for supervised fine-tuning. Combined with general open-source LLM data, these resources enable the training of RedSage, an open-source, locally deployable cybersecurity assistant with domain-aware pretraining and post-training. To rigorously evaluate the models, we introduce RedSage-Bench, a benchmark with 30K multiple-choice and 240 open-ended Q&A items covering cybersecurity knowledge, skills, and tool expertise. RedSage is further evaluated on established cybersecurity benchmarks (e.g., CTI-Bench, CyberMetric, SECURE) and general LLM benchmarks to assess broader generalization.

A lack of diversity in datasets and models can\nhinder the usefulness of ml in many critical applications, e.g. scienti\ufb01c discovery. It\nis therefore important to be able to measure diversity.\nMany diversity metrics have been proposed in ML, but these metrics are often\ndomain-speci\ufb01c and limited in \ufb02exibility. These include metrics that de\ufb01ne diversity\nin terms of a reference dataset (Heusel et al., 2017; Sajjadi et al., 2018), a pre-\n1Code for calculating the Vendi Score is available at https://github.com/vertaix/Vendi-Score .\n2trained classi\ufb01er (Salimans et al., 2016; Srivastava et al., 2017), or discrete features,\nlike n-grams (Li et al., 2016). In this paper, we propose a general, reference-free\napproach that de\ufb01nes diversity in terms of a user-speci\ufb01ed similarity function.\nOur approach is based on work in ecology, where biological diversity has been\nde\ufb01ned as the exponential of the entropy of the distribution of species within a\npopulation (Hill, 1973; Jost, 2006; Leinster, 2021). This value can be interpreted\nas the effective number of species in the population. To adapt this approach to ML,\nwe de\ufb01ne the diversity of a collection of elements x1, . . . , xnas the exponential of\nthe entropy of the eigenvalues of the n\u0002nsimilarity matrix K, whose entries are\nequal to the similarity scores between each pair of elements. This entropy can be\nseen as the von Neumann entropy associated with K(Bengtsson and \u02d9Zyczkowski,\n2017), so we call our metric the Vendi Score , for the von Neumann diversity.\nContributions. We summarize our contributions as follows:\n\u2022We extend ecological diversity to ML, and propose the Vendi Score, a metric for\nevaluating diversity in ML. We study the properties of the Vendi Score, which\nprovides us with a more formal understanding of desiderata for diversity.\n\u2022We showcase the \ufb02exibility and wide applicability of the Vendi Score, char-\nacteristics that stem from its sole reliance on the sample to be evaluated for\ndiversity and a user-de\ufb01ned similarity function, and highlight the shortcom-\nings of existing metrics used to measure diversity in different domains.\n2 Are We Measuring Diversity Correctly in ML?\nSeveral existing metrics for diversity rely on a reference distribution or dataset.\nThese reference-based metrics de\ufb01ne diversity in terms of coverage of the reference.\nThey assume access to an embedding function\u2013such as a pretrained Inception\nmodel (Szegedy et al., 2016)\u2013that maps samples to real-valued vectors. One example\nof a reference-based metric is Fr\u00e9chet Inception distance (\ufb01d) (Heusel et al., 2017),\nwhich measures the Wasserstein-2 distance between two Gaussian distributions, one\nGaussian \ufb01t to the embeddings of the reference sample and another one \ufb01t to the\nembeddings of the sample to be evaluated for diversity. \ufb01d was originally proposed\nfor evaluating image generative adversarial networks (gans) but has since been\napplied to text (C\u00edfka et al., 2018) and molecules (Preuer et al., 2018) using domain-\nspeci\ufb01c neural network encoders. Sajjadi et al. (2018) proposed a two-metric\nevaluation paradigm using precision and recall, with precision measuring quality\nand recall measuring diversity in terms of coverage of the reference distribution.\nSeveral other variations of precision and recall have been proposed (Kynk\u00e4\u00e4nniemi\net al., 2019; Simon et al., 2019; Naeem et al., 2020).

The Vendi Score was introduced as a generic similarity-based diversity metric that extends the Hill number of order q=1 by leveraging ideas from quantum statistical mechanics. Contrary to many diversity metrics in ecology, the Vendi Score accounts for similarity and does not require knowledge of the prevalence of the categories in the collection to be evaluated for diversity. However, the Vendi Score treats each item in a given collection with a level of sensitivity proportional to the item's prevalence. This is undesirable in settings where there is a significant imbalance in item prevalence. In this paper, we extend the other Hill numbers using similarity to provide flexibility in allocating sensitivity to rare or common items. This leads to a family of diversity metrics -- Vendi scores with different levels of sensitivity -- that can be used in a variety of applications. We study the properties of the scores in a synthetic controlled setting where the ground truth diversity is known. We then test their utility in improving molecular simulations via Vendi Sampling. Finally, we use the Vendi scores to better understand the behavior of image generative models in terms of memorization, duplication, diversity, and sample quality.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12952v3\", \"timestamp\": 1697737924, \"sections\": \"### One-Sentence Overview\\nTo address the limitations of existing diversity metrics (e.g., the original Vendi Score) in handling class imbalance and providing nuanced sensitivity, this paper proposes a family of Vendi scores parameterized by an order \\\\(q\\\\), which extends the Hill numbers from ecology to account for similarity in an unsupervised manner; empirical validation on molecular simulations (Alanine Dipeptide) and image generative models demonstrates that different \\\\(q\\\\) values enable tailored sensitivity to rare items or duplicates, revealing that models with high sample quality often achieve it through memorization, and the method accelerates molecular mixing and provides a more comprehensive evaluation framework.\\n\\n### Key Information Checklist\\n- **Research Background & Core Pain Point**: Reliable, interpretable diversity metrics are crucial for evaluating generative models, curating datasets, and analyzing scientific data.

One-Sentence Overview\\nTo address the limitations of existing diversity metrics (e.g., the original Vendi Score) in handling class imbalance and providing nuanced sensitivity to item prevalence, this paper proposes a family of Vendi scores parameterized by an order \\\\( q \\\\), which extends the Hill numbers from ecology to account for similarity in an unsupervised manner; empirical validation on molecular simulations and generative models shows that different \\\\( q \\\\) values enable tailored diversity measurement (e.g., \\\\( q \\\\approx 0.5 \\\\) for rare class detection, \\\\( q = \\\\infty \\\\) for detecting duplication), revealing that high-quality generative models often achieve good scores through memorization and duplication, thus advocating for the joint use of Vendi scores with sample quality metrics.\\n\\n### 2. Key Information Checklist\\n- **Research Background & Core Pain Point**: Reliable, interpretable diversity metrics are crucial for evaluating generative models, datasets, and scientific phenomena, but existing metrics (e.g., Hill numbers, average pairwise similarity, FID) often fail to account for item similarity, require class labels or prevalence knowledge, or are insensitive to class imbalance, as illustrated by the original Vendi Score (\\\\( q=1 \\\\)) failing to detect rare classes under imbalance.\\n- **Proposed Core Method/Theory**: The paper extends the Vendi Score into a family of metrics, \\\\( \\\\text{VS}_q \\\\), by introducing an order parameter \\\\( q \\\\geq 0 \\\\). This is grounded in a novel **Similarity-Eigenvalue-Prevalence Theorem**, which connects the eigenvalues of a normalized similarity matrix to item prevalence, allowing the derivation of \\\\( \\\\text{VS}_q \\\\) as the exponential of the R\\u00e9nyi entropy of these eigenvalues. This creates a spectrum where small \\\\( q \\\\) prioritizes rare items and large \\\\( q \\\\) (especially \\\\( q=\\\\infty \\\\)) emphasizes common items/duplicates.\\n- **Key Experimental Results & Validation**:\\n    - **Molecular Simulation (Alanine Dipeptide)**: Demonstrates that \\\\( \\\\text{VS}_{q=0.5 \\\\text{ or } 1} \\\\) is most sensitive to missing a rare conformational state (~1% prevalence), while \\\\( \\\\text{VS}_{\\\\infty} \\\\) facilitates the fastest mixing and transitions across energy barriers in Vendi Sampling.\\n    - **Generative Model Evaluation**: On 40 models across datasets (CIFAR-10, ImageNet, etc.), \\\\( \\\\text{VS}_{\\\\infty} \\\\) shows strong **negative correlation** with sample quality metrics (Fr\\u00e9chet Distance, Kernel Distance) and human error rate, and a strong **positive correlation** with the memorization metric \\\\( C_T \\\\)-modified. This indicates that models with apparently high sample quality often achieve it by memorizing and duplicating training samples.\\n    - **Correlation Analysis**: \\\\( \\\\text{VS}_{\\\\infty} \\\\) is identified as an effective proxy for memorization/duplication, while small-\\\\( q \\\\) scores (e.g., \\\\( q \\\\in [0.1, 0.5] \\\\)) better reflect true diversity and are sensitive to rare items.\\n- **Final Conclusions & Contributions**:\\n    - **Theoretical**: Provides a unified, similarity-based framework extending Hill numbers, resulting in a differentiable, interpretable family of diversity metrics (\\\\( \\\\text{VS}_q \\\\)) that do not require class labels or prevalence knowledge.\\n    - **Empirical/Practical**: Establishes guidelines for selecting \\\\( q \\\\): use small \\\\( q \\\\) for diversity measurement, and \\\\( \\\\text{VS}_{\\\\infty} \\\\) for detecting duplication/memorization.

The Vendi Score was introduced as a generic similarity-based diversity metric that extends the Hill number of order q=1 by leveraging ideas from quantum statistical mechanics. Contrary to many diversity metrics in ecology, the Vendi Score accounts for similarity and does not require knowledge of the prevalence of the categories in the collection to be evaluated for diversity. However, the Vendi Score treats each item in a given collection with a level of sensitivity proportional to the item's prevalence. This is undesirable in settings where there is a significant imbalance in item prevalence. In this paper, we extend the other Hill numbers using similarity to provide flexibility in allocating sensitivity to rare or common items. This leads to a family of diversity metrics -- Vendi scores with different levels of sensitivity -- that can be used in a variety of applications. We study the properties of the scores in a synthetic controlled setting where the ground truth diversity is known. We then test their utility in improving molecular simulations via Vendi Sampling.

One-Sentence Overview\\nTo address the limitations of existing diversity metrics (e.g., the original Vendi Score) in handling class imbalance and providing nuanced sensitivity to item prevalence, this paper proposes a family of Vendi scores parameterized by an order \\\\( q \\\\), which, through a theoretical link to Hill numbers and similarity matrices, enables tunable sensitivity to rare or common items, as validated by improved molecular simulation convergence and the revelation that high-quality generative models often achieve good scores through memorization and duplication.\\n\\n### 2. Key Information Checklist\\n- **Research Background & Core Pain Point**: Reliable, unsupervised diversity metrics are crucial for evaluating generative models and scientific data, but existing metrics like the original Vendi Score (\\\\(q=1\\\\)) fail under class imbalance by insufficiently weighting rare items, and other metrics (e.g., FID, coverage) are reference-dependent or non-differentiable.\\n- **Proposed Core Method/Theory**: The paper extends the Vendi Score into a family of metrics \\\\(VS_q\\\\), defined by the order \\\\(q \\\\geq 0\\\\), based on the eigenvalues of a normalized similarity matrix. This is grounded in a novel **Similarity-Eigenvalue-Prevalence Theorem**, which formally connects eigenvalues to item prevalence, generalizing Hill numbers to account for similarity without requiring prior class labels.\\n- **Key Experimental Results & Validation**:\\n    - **Molecular Simulation (Vendi Sampling)**: Using different \\\\(q\\\\) values in Alanine Dipeptide simulations shows that \\\\(q=\\\\infty\\\\) accelerates mixing by focusing on the largest eigenvalue (common modes), while intermediate \\\\(q\\\\) (e.g., 0.5, 1) better detects rare conformational states.\\n    - **Generative Model Evaluation**: Analysis of 40 image generative models shows \\\\(VS_\\\\infty\\\\) is strongly negatively correlated with sample quality metrics (Fr\\u00e9chet Distance, Human Error Rate) and positively correlated with memorization metrics (\\\\(C_T\\\\)-modified), revealing that models with apparently high quality often produce duplicates around memorized training data.\\n    - **Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematic experiments (Fig. 1) demonstrate that smaller \\\\(q\\\\) (e.g., 0.1, 0.5) are more sensitive to rare classes and intra-class variance, while larger \\\\(q\\\\) (especially \\\\(\\\\infty\\\\)) are sensitive to common items/duplicates.\\n- **Final Conclusions & Contributions**:\\n    - Introduces a flexible, interpretable, and differentiable family of diversity metrics (\\\\(VS_q\\\\)) that satisfy ecological diversity axioms.\\n    - Provides a practical framework for choosing \\\\(q\\\\) based on the application: small \\\\(q\\\\) for measuring diversity sensitive to rare items, and \\\\(VS_\\\\infty\\\\) for detecting duplication/memorization.\\n    - Demonstrates that evaluating generative models requires pairing sample quality metrics with \\\\(VS_q\\\\) to distinguish true diversity from memorization.\\n    - Shows the scores can indirectly assess memorization and coverage without needing training data, which is valuable for privacy and closed-source settings.\\n\\n### 3.

For instance, learning curves can be used to model the performance of the combination of an algorithm and its hyperparameter configuration, providing insights into their potential suitability at an early stage and often expediting the algorithm selection process. Various learning curve models have been proposed to use learning curves for decision making. Some of these models answer the binary decision question of whether a given algorithm at a certain budget will outperform a certain reference performance, whereas more complex models predict the entire learning curve of an algorithm.

Current metrics often fail to account for the sensitivity of item prevalence, leading to misleading evaluations of model performance and diversity.\n\n#### Question 2 - Why is it interesting and important?\nAddressing this problem is crucial for advancing the field of machine learning, as reliable diversity metrics are essential for evaluating generative models, datasets, and scientific phenomena. Improved metrics can lead to better model performance, more effective data utilization, and enhanced interpretability, ultimately benefiting various applications, including healthcare, ecology, and artificial intelligence.\n\n#### Question 3 - Why is it hard?\nDeveloping new diversity metrics is challenging due to several factors, including the need to balance sensitivity to class imbalance with the ability to provide nuanced evaluations of diversity. Additionally, the integration of uncertainty quantification into these metrics adds complexity, as it requires a deep understanding of both statistical methods and machine learning principles.\n\n#### Question 4 - Why hasn't it been solved before?\nPrevious research has often overlooked the interplay between diversity metrics and class imbalance, leading to a lack of comprehensive solutions. Existing metrics, including the Vendi Score, have limitations in their sensitivity to item prevalence and do not adequately address the complexities of diverse data distributions. Furthermore, the integration of uncertainty quantification into diversity metrics has not been extensively explored.\n\n#### Question 5 - What are the key components of my approach and results?\nOur proposed approach involves developing a family of adaptive diversity metrics that leverage the strengths of the Vendi Score while addressing its limitations. We will parameterize these metrics to allow for tailored sensitivity based on data distribution. Additionally, we will integrate uncertainty quantification methods to enhance the robustness of our evaluations. The expected outcomes include improved diversity assessments in generative models, better understanding of model behavior, and practical guidelines for selecting appropriate metrics in various applications.\n\n### Next Steps\n- **Collaborate with Teammates**: Share this draft with teammates for feedback and to ensure all contributions are integrated into the final proposal.\n- **Synthesize Ideas**: Reference and build upon the ideas generated during the brainstorming session to create a cohesive narrative.\n\nBy focusing on these tasks, I will enhance my contribution to the team's goals and improve overall performance in the next round.
