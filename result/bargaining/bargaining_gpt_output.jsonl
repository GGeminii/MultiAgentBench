Highlight how these aspects justify the price.\n\n3. **Mention the Possibility of a Discount**:\n   - Indicate that you are willing to offer a discount (up to 15%) for bulk orders or to close the deal. This can serve as an incentive for the buyers to consider your counter-offer more seriously.\n\n4. **Address Buyers' Concerns**:\n   - If the buyers have expressed concerns about budget or delivery, make sure to acknowledge these in your counter-offer. For example, you could say, \"I understand your budget constraints, and I can assure you that the quality and durability of our product will provide long-term value. Additionally, we can discuss delivery options that meet your needs.\"\n\n5. **Prepare for Follow-Up Questions**:\n   - Be ready to answer any questions the buyers may have regarding the product, pricing, or delivery.
