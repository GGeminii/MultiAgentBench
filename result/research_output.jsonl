A key challenge in\nFL is statistical heterogeneity, e.g., the not independent and\nidentically distributed (Non-IID) and unbalanced data across\nclients. This kind of data makes it hard to obtain a global\nmodel that generalizes to each client (McMahan et al. 2017;\nReisizadeh et al. 2020; T Dinh, Tran, and Nguyen 2020).\nPersonalized FL (pFL) Related Work\nTraditional Federated Learning\nThe widely known traditional FL method FedAvg (McMa-\nhan et al. 2017) learns a single global model for all clientsby aggregating their local models. However, it often suffers\nin statistically heterogeneous settings, e.g., FL with Non-\nIID and unbalanced data (Kairouz et al. 2019; Zhao et al.\n2018). To address this issue, FedProx (Li et al. 2020) im-\nproves the stability of the FL process through a proximal\nterm. To counteract the bias introduced by the Non-IID data,\nFA VOR (Wang et al. 2020a) selects a subset of clients based\non deep Q-learning (Van Hasselt, Guez, and Silver 2016)\nat each iteration. By generating the global model layer-\nwise, FedMA (Wang et al. 2020b) can adapt to statistical\nheterogeneity with the matched averaging approach.
