For knowledge point extraction, we should define rules for identifying and categorizing key concepts, as well as standards for presenting this information in a clear and concise manner.

The steps you've identified - defining the training package scope, extracting knowledge points, combining operational steps, and encapsulating data - are all crucial components of the AI-driven training package generation process. To assist with defining operational specifications for the process, I can help with detailing the input/output requirements for each step, establishing the flow logic, and determining the execution conditions for links such as data parsing and knowledge point extraction. Let's work together to create a comprehensive and standardized process for generating modular training packages. How do you propose we proceed with defining the operational specifications for each step, and what specific aspects would you like me to focus on first?', \nFrom agent2 to agent3: I propose we proceed by first detailing the input/output requirements for each step, starting with defining the training package scope. For this step, the input could include the training objectives, target audience, and relevant knowledge points, while the output could be a clear definition of the training package scope. Then, we can establish the flow logic and determine the execution conditions for links such as data parsing and knowledge point extraction. I would like you to focus on detailing the input/output requirements for the knowledge point extraction step, including the specific data sources, extraction rules, and output formats. How do you suggest we standardize the knowledge point extraction process to ensure consistency and accuracy across different training packages?', \nFrom agent3 to agent2: To standardize the knowledge point extraction process, I suggest we establish a set of predefined data sources, such as relevant documents, expert interviews, and existing training materials. We can also develop a set of extraction rules based on natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to ensure consistency and accuracy. Additionally, we can define a standardized output format for the extracted knowledge points, such as a structured database or a knowledge graph, to facilitate easy access and reuse across different training packages. By standardizing the knowledge point extraction process, we can ensure that the extracted knowledge points are accurate, relevant, and consistent, which will ultimately improve the quality of the training packages. What are your thoughts on this approach, and how do you propose we implement it in the AI-driven training package generation process?', \n"], "total_milestones": 10, "agent_kpis": {"Agent_1": 2, "Agent_2": 1, "Agent_3": 1, "Agent_4": 2, "agent2": 3, "agent3": 1}}, {"iteration": 4, "task_assignments": {"agent1": "The next task for 'agent1' should be to:\n\n1. **Extract basic information** such as training requirements, target competencies, core knowledge points, and operational scenarios from the conveyor belt case provided in the task instance.\n\nThis involves analyzing the scenario to identify key elements necessary for training, such as:\n   - **Training Requirements**: What skills or knowledge are required to operate the conveyor belt system safely and efficiently?\n   - **Target Competencies**: What are the specific competencies that trainees should achieve after completing the training?\n   - **Core Knowledge Points**: What are the essential pieces of knowledge that trainees must understand to operate the system, such as how the electric motors, contactors, and solenoid valve work?\n   - **Operational Scenarios**: What are the step-by-step procedures for operating the conveyor belt system, including normal operation, startup, shutdown, and troubleshooting? \n\nThis task aligns with the role of the Training Requirements Extraction Specialist and is the first step in creating a comprehensive training program for the conveyor belt system.", "agent2": "Based on the provided task history and the role of the agent as an AI-driven Training Package Generation Process Analyst, the next task should align with the responsibilities of organizing the generation process of modular training packages and transforming complex AI workflows into clear step sequences.\n\nGiven the scenario-driven modular training system research task and the specific task instance provided, the next task should focus on **Process Organization**.
