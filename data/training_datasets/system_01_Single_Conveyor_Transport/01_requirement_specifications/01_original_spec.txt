The system consists of a conveyor belt driven by an electric motor. A normally open start button is used to initiate the transport cycle. When the start button is pressed, the start light is turned on and the conveyor motor is activated. A photoelectric exit sensor is installed at the end of the conveyor. When the sensor detects the presence of a box, the conveyor motor stops and the start light turns off. The system waits for the next press of the start button to repeat the cycle.
