The system consists of two conveyor belts, each driven by an electric motor and controlled by contactors KM1 and KM2. A double-acting cylinder is used to transfer boxes between the conveyors. The cylinder is controlled by a 5/2-way solenoid valve. A start button is used to initiate the cycle. When the start button is pressed, the start light turns on. At the same time, Conveyor One and Conveyor Two are both activated. The box on Conveyor One moves forward until it reaches the entry sensor. Once the entry sensor is triggered, Conveyor One stops. The double-acting cylinder then extends forward. It continues moving until it activates the front limit switch. When the front limit switch is triggered, the solenoid valve is reversed, and the cylinder retracts. The cylinder moves back until the back limit switch is triggered. Conveyor Two continues running during the entire process. When the exit sensor detects the presence of the box at the end of Conveyor Two, and the cylinder has fully retracted, the system restarts the cycle. Conveyor One is activated again to bring the next box forward.
