The system consists of two conveyor belts, each driven by an electric motor: Conveyor One and Conveyor Two. A start button is used to initiate the cycle. When the start button is pressed, the start light turns on, and Conveyor One is activated. The box moves forward until it reaches Sensor A. Once Sensor A is triggered, Conveyor One stops, and Conveyor Two is activated. The box continues moving until it reaches Sensor B, which stops Conveyor Two. The start light then turns off. The system is now idle and waits for the next press of the start button to repeat the cycle.
