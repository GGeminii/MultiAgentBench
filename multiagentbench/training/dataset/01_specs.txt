The system consists of a conveyor belt actuated by an electric motor. The transport cycle begins when a normally open start button is pressed. This action turns on the start light and powers the conveyor motor. Positioned at the conveyor's end is a photoelectric exit sensor. When the sensor senses a box, the conveyor motor stops and the start light switches off. The system then waits for the next activation of the start button to repeat the transport cycle.
