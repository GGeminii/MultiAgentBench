The system includes two conveyor belts, each powered by an electric motor and controlled through contactors KM1 and KM2. Boxes are transferred between the conveyors using a double-acting cylinder. Control of the cylinder is managed by a 5/2-way solenoid valve. A start button initiates the operation cycle. Upon pressing the start button, the start light illuminates, and both Conveyor One and Conveyor Two begin running. The box on Conveyor One advances until it activates the entry sensor. This activation causes Conveyor One to stop. Next, the double-acting cylinder extends forward until it triggers the front limit switch. Once the front limit switch is engaged, the solenoid valve reverses, causing the cylinder to retract. The cylinder continues to move back until the back limit switch is activated. Throughout this sequence, Conveyor Two remains in motion. When the exit sensor detects the box at the end of Conveyor Two and the cylinder is fully retracted, the system restarts the cycle by activating Conveyor One again to move the next box forward.
Two conveyor belts form the system, each driven by an electric motor with contactors KM1 and KM2 controlling their operation. To move boxes between the conveyors, a double-acting cylinder is used, which is controlled by a 5/2-way solenoid valve. The process begins when the start button is pressed, turning on the start light. Both Conveyor One and Conveyor Two then start simultaneously. A box moves along Conveyor One until it reaches the entry sensor, which stops Conveyor One when triggered. The double-acting cylinder extends forward and continues until it activates the front limit switch. Triggering this switch causes the solenoid valve to reverse, retracting the cylinder until the back limit switch is reached. Conveyor Two keeps running during this entire time. After the exit sensor detects the box at the end of Conveyor Two and the cylinder has fully retracted, the system repeats the cycle by reactivating Conveyor One to bring the next box forward.
The setup consists of two conveyor belts, each driven by its own electric motor and controlled by contactors KM1 and KM2. A double-acting cylinder transfers boxes between these conveyors and is operated via a 5/2-way solenoid valve. When the start button is pressed, it activates the start light and simultaneously starts both Conveyor One and Conveyor Two. The box on Conveyor One moves forward until it reaches the entry sensor, which then stops Conveyor One. The double-acting cylinder extends forward until it hits the front limit switch. At this point, the solenoid valve reverses, retracting the cylinder back until the back limit switch is triggered. During this entire cycle, Conveyor Two remains active. Once the exit sensor detects the box at the end of Conveyor Two and the cylinder is fully retracted, the system begins the cycle again by turning on Conveyor One to advance the next box.
The system is made up of two conveyor belts, each powered by an electric motor and controlled by contactors KM1 and KM2. To transfer boxes from one conveyor to the other, a double-acting cylinder is employed. This cylinder is operated by a 5/2-way solenoid valve. The cycle begins when the start button is pressed. Pressing the start button turns on the start light, and both Conveyor One and Conveyor Two start running simultaneously. A box on Conveyor One moves forward until it activates the entry sensor. When the entry sensor is triggered, Conveyor One stops. Following this, the double-acting cylinder extends forward and keeps moving until it hits the front limit switch. Triggering the front limit switch causes the solenoid valve to reverse, retracting the cylinder until the back limit switch is activated. Conveyor Two remains running throughout the entire sequence.

Boxes are transferred between these conveyors using a double-acting cylinder that is controlled by a 5/2-way solenoid valve. The operation cycle starts when the start button is pressed. Upon pressing, the start light turns on and both Conveyor One and Conveyor Two activate together. The box on Conveyor One moves forward until the entry sensor detects it. This detection stops Conveyor One. Then, the double-acting cylinder extends forward until it triggers the front limit switch. After activation of the front limit switch, the solenoid valve reverses, causing the cylinder to retract until the back limit switch is reached.

The cycle starts when the start button is pressed, turning on the start light and activating both Conveyor One and Conveyor Two simultaneously. The box on Conveyor One advances until it triggers the entry sensor, which causes Conveyor One to stop. Next, the double-acting cylinder extends forward until it reaches the front limit switch. When the front limit switch is triggered, the solenoid valve reverses direction, retracting the cylinder until the back limit switch is engaged. Conveyor Two remains active throughout the operation. Once the exit sensor detects the box at the end of Conveyor Two and the cylinder has fully retracted, the cycle begins again with Conveyor One moving the next box forward.

The cycle starts when the start button is pressed, activating the start light. At the same time, both Conveyor One and Conveyor Two begin operating. The box on Conveyor One advances until it reaches the entry sensor, which stops Conveyor One when triggered. The double-acting cylinder then extends forward until it activates the front limit switch. Upon activation, the solenoid valve reverses direction, causing the cylinder to retract until the back limit switch is engaged. Conveyor Two continues running throughout the process. When the exit sensor detects the box at the end of Conveyor Two and the cylinder has fully retracted, the cycle restarts by activating Conveyor One to bring the next box forward.

The system consists of two conveyor belts, each powered by an electric motor and controlled by contactors KM1 and KM2. A dual-acting pneumatic cylinder is used to transfer boxes between the conveyors. This cylinder is controlled by a five-port two-position valve. The cycle starts when the start button is pressed, which turns on the start light. At the same time, both Conveyor One and Conveyor Two begin operating. The box on Conveyor One moves forward until it activates the entry sensor, causing Conveyor One to stop. The dual-acting pneumatic cylinder then extends forward until it triggers the front limit switch. When the front limit switch is activated, the valve reverses direction, retracting the cylinder until it reaches the back limit switch. Conveyor Two runs continuously during the entire process. After the exit sensor detects the box at the end of Conveyor Two and the cylinder has fully retracted, the cycle restarts by activating Conveyor One to move the next box forward.
Two conveyor belts comprise the system, each driven by an electric motor and controlled with contactors KM1 and KM2. Boxes are transferred between the conveyors by a pneumatic cylinder, which is controlled by a 5/2 solenoid valve. The cycle initiates when the start button is pressed, lighting the start indicator and simultaneously activating Conveyor One and Conveyor Two. The box on Conveyor One moves forward until it triggers the entry sensor, which stops Conveyor One. The pneumatic cylinder extends forward until it activates the front limit switch. Once triggered, the solenoid valve reverses, causing the cylinder to retract until the back limit switch is engaged. Conveyor Two continues running throughout the entire operation. When the exit sensor detects the box at the end of Conveyor Two and the cylinder is fully retracted, the system restarts the cycle by activating Conveyor One to bring the next box forward.

The box on Conveyor One advances until it reaches the entry sensor, which stops Conveyor One once activated. The dual-acting cylinder extends forward until it triggers the front limit switch. When the front limit switch is activated, the solenoid valve reverses, causing the cylinder to retract until the back limit switch is reached. Conveyor Two continues operating throughout the entire process. Once the exit sensor detects the box at the end of Conveyor Two and the cylinder has fully retracted, the cycle restarts by activating Conveyor One to move the next box forward.
Two conveyor belts form the system, each driven by an electric motor and controlled through contactors KM1 and KM2. Boxes are transferred between the conveyors by a double acting pneumatic cylinder, which is operated by a five-port two-position valve.

The box moves forward on Conveyor One until it reaches the entry sensor, which then stops Conveyor One. The dual-acting cylinder extends forward until it triggers the front limit switch. After activation, the solenoid valve switches, causing the cylinder to retract. The cylinder continues retracting until the back limit switch is reached. Conveyor Two runs continuously during this operation. When the exit sensor senses the box at the end of Conveyor Two and the cylinder has fully retracted, the system initiates the cycle again by activating Conveyor One to move the next box.

The box on Conveyor One advances until it activates the entry sensor, causing Conveyor One to stop. The dual-acting cylinder then extends forward until it hits the front limit switch. Once the front limit switch is activated, the valve switches direction, retracting the cylinder until it reaches the back limit switch. Throughout this cycle, Conveyor Two remains active. When the exit sensor senses the box at the end of Conveyor Two and the cylinder is fully retracted, the system restarts by activating Conveyor One to move the next box forward.
This setup includes two conveyor belts, each driven by an electric motor and controlled through contactors KM1 and KM2. Boxes are moved between the conveyors using a double acting pneumatic cylinder controlled by a five two-way solenoid valve. Pressing the start button initiates the cycle, lighting the start indicator and activating both conveyors. The box on Conveyor One moves until the entry sensor is triggered, which stops Conveyor One. The pneumatic cylinder then extends forward until it trips the front limit switch. After that, the solenoid valve reverses, causing the cylinder to retract until the back limit switch is triggered. Conveyor Two operates continuously during this operation. Once the exit sensor detects the box at the end of Conveyor Two and the cylinder is fully retracted, the process restarts with Conveyor One moving the next box ahead.

The box advances along Conveyor One until the entry sensor is reached, which halts Conveyor One. Then, the two-way cylinder extends, proceeding until it trips the front limit switch. When this switch is engaged, the 5/2 valve shifts, retracting the cylinder. The cylinder pulls back until the back limit switch is activated. Conveyor Two continues running throughout the sequence. After the exit sensor senses the box at the end of Conveyor Two and the cylinder is fully retracted, the cycle begins anew with Conveyor One starting to move the next box.

Initiating the cycle is done by pressing the start push button, which turns on the start light. Both conveyors begin moving at the same time. The box moves forward on Conveyor One until it hits the entry sensor, causing Conveyor One to stop. The two-way pneumatic cylinder then extends until it activates the front limit switch. When this switch is triggered, the valve changes state, retracting the cylinder. The cylinder moves back until it hits the back limit switch. Throughout this process, Conveyor Two runs continuously. Once the exit sensor detects the box at the end of Conveyor Two and the cylinder is fully retracted, the cycle restarts with Conveyor One moving the next box forward.

Conveyor One moves the box forward until the entry sensor is triggered, stopping the conveyor. The two-way cylinder extends forward, continuing until it trips the front limit switch. At this point, the control valve switches, retracting the cylinder until the back limit switch is activated. Throughout this process, Conveyor Two remains active. When the exit sensor detects the box at Conveyor Two's end and the cylinder is fully retracted, the system cycles again by starting Conveyor One for the next box.
The setup consists of two conveyor belts, each equipped with an electric motor and controlled by contactors KM1 and KM2. A bidirectional pneumatic cylinder is tasked with transferring boxes between conveyors. It is controlled by a five two directional control valve. Pressing the start push button activates the start light and simultaneously powers Conveyor One and Conveyor Two. The box on Conveyor One moves ahead until it reaches the entry sensor, which causes Conveyor One to stop. The bidirectional pneumatic cylinder extends until the front limit switch is reached, which then signals the valve to reverse and retract the cylinder. The cylinder moves backward until it activates the back limit switch. Conveyor Two continues to run during the entire operation. Once the exit sensor detects the box at the end of Conveyor Two and the cylinder is fully retracted, the system initiates the cycle again by starting Conveyor One to move the next box forward.

The cylinder is regulated by a five port dual position valve. The cycle starts when the start push button is pressed, turning on the start light. Both conveyors operate at the same time. The box on Conveyor One proceeds until it reaches the entry sensor, which stops Conveyor One. The two-way cylinder extends until it activates the front limit switch. Once triggered, the valve switches, and the cylinder retracts. Retraction continues until the back limit switch is engaged. Conveyor Two runs continuously during the entire cycle. When the exit sensor detects the box at the end of Conveyor Two and the cylinder is fully retracted, the cycle begins again by starting Conveyor One for the next box.
The system is composed of two conveyor belts, each powered by an electric motor and controlled by contactors KM1 and KM2. A bidirectional pneumatic cylinder is used to transfer boxes between conveyors. This cylinder is controlled by a five two directional control valve. Pressing the start button initiates the cycle and turns on the start light. Conveyor One and Conveyor Two both activate simultaneously. The box on Conveyor One moves forward until it triggers the entry sensor, causing Conveyor One to stop. The bidirectional pneumatic cylinder then extends until it hits the front limit switch. When the switch activates, the valve reverses, causing the cylinder to retract. The cylinder returns until the back limit switch is triggered. Conveyor Two continues running throughout the operation. Once the exit sensor detects the box at the end of Conveyor Two and the cylinder is fully retracted, the cycle restarts by activating Conveyor One to bring forward the next box.
