  profile: 'As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks
    (GNNs) and their applications, my work primarily revolves around enhancing the
    capabilities and understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications
    reflect a commitment to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures.
    For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture the positional
    context of nodes within graphs, which has proven effective in various prediction
    tasks, achieving significant performance improvements.


    I am particularly interested in the interplay between graph structures and predictive
    performance, as demonstrated in my work on relational graphs that reveal a "sweet
    spot" for optimizing neural network architectures. This exploration has led to
    the creation of Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which enhance the expressive power
    of message-passing frameworks by incorporating node identities.


    Additionally, I have tackled the challenges posed by dynamic graphs through the
    ROLAND framework, which allows for the seamless adaptation of static GNNs to dynamic
    environments. My research also extends to automated machine learning (AutoML),
    where I introduced FALCON and AutoTransfer to streamline the search for optimal
    model designs across various tasks, significantly reducing computational costs.


    Overall, my goal is to push the boundaries of GNN research, providing scalable
    solutions and insights that can be applied across a wide range of domains, from
    social networks to biological systems. I am passionate about fostering a deeper
    understanding of how graph-based approaches can transform machine learning and
    contribute to solving complex real-world problems.'

    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n            Abstract —Efficient data transmission\
    \ across mobile multi-hop\nnetworks that connect edge devices to core servers\
    \ presents\nsignificant challenges, particularly due to the variability in link\n\
    qualities between wireless and wired segments. This variability\nnecessitates\
    \ a robust transmission scheme that transcends the lim-\nitations of existing\
    \ deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC)\nstrategies, which often struggle\
    \ at the intersection of analog\nand digitalmethods with η= 1,9dB is shown in\
    \ Fig.\n12. We can find the naive initialization method10converges to\nsub-optimal\
    \ solution whose R-D performance is significantly\noutperformed by the second\
    \ method. It can also be seen that\nfor a fixed λ, the bpp values of the random\
    \ initialization\nmethod nearly keep the same w.r.t different ηvalues which\n\
    matches the analysis of the empirical distribution, ˆP˜xηshown\nin Fig. 7. Thus,\
    \ we adopt the second initialization method\nthroughout this paper.\n2) Fully\
    \ adaptive h-DJSCC framework: Then, we evaluate\nthe fully adaptive h-DJSCC framework\
    \ whose aim is to use a\nsingle model to provide satisfactory R-D performance\
    \ for each\n9It is also possible to update/optimize the loaded weights during\
    \ training,\nyet we find it leads to nearly the same performance compared with\
    \ the fixed\none.\n10We show theexperiments that\nthe SNR-adaptive DeepJSCC encoder\
    \ (without being jointly\ntrained with the compression models) produces the desired\n\
    output distribution. Thus, we initialize the SNR-adaptive h-\nDJSCC model using\
    \ the pre-trained SNR-adaptive DeepJSCC\nmodel. As will be shown in the simulation\
    \ section, the\nabove training approach fulfills the SNR-adaptive objective.\n\
    Moreover, by comparing the right hand side of Fig. 7 with\nthe left, we observe\
    \ that the pre-trained model yields more\n‘distinct’ output distribution w.r.t\
    \ different SNR values.\nC. Fully adaptive h-DJSCC framework\nFinally, we introduce\
    \ the fully adaptive h-DJSCC frame-\nwork. We will first discuss the variable\
    \ rate h-DJSCC frame-\nwork with a fixed ηvalue, inspired by [21]–[23] for image\n\
    compression. In particular, [21]–[23] mitigate the problem by\nintroducing extra\
    \ learnable parameters called scaling factorsAlgorithm 1: Training procedure of\
