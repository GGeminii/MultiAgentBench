  profile: 'As a researcher deeply immersed in the field of graph neural networks
    (GNNs) and machine learning, my work focuses on enhancing the capabilities and
    understanding of these powerful models. My recent publications reflect a commitment
    to addressing the limitations of existing GNN architectures and exploring innovative
    solutions. For instance, I developed Position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) to better capture
    the positional context of nodes within graphs, significantly improving performance
    in tasks like link prediction and community detection.


    I also introduced Identity-aware GNNs (ID-GNNs), which extend the expressive power
    of traditional GNNs by incorporating node identity during message passing. This
    advancement has led to substantial accuracy improvements across various prediction
    tasks. My research doesn''t stop at static graphs; I proposed the ROLAND framework
    to effectively handle dynamic graphs, allowing for scalable and efficient training
    methods that adapt to real-world scenarios.


    In addition to architectural innovations, I have explored the design space of
    GNNs, systematically studying over 315,000 different configurations to provide
    guidelines for optimal model design. My work on AutoML, particularly with FALCON
    and AutoTransfer, aims to streamline the process of finding effective neural architectures
    by leveraging prior knowledge and enhancing search efficiency.


    Through these contributions, I strive to push the boundaries of what GNNs can
    achieve, fostering a deeper understanding of their structure and performance across
    diverse applications.'

  content: "\n            Dear Research Team,\n\n            You are collaborating\
    \ to generate a new research idea based on the following Introduction:\n\n   \
    \         **Introduction**\n\n             \n\n1 Introduction\n\nState-of-the-art\
    \ LLMs such as GPT-4 (Achiam et al. 2023), Gemini (Team et al. 2023), Llama-3 (Meta\
    \ 2024), and Claude-3 Sonnet (Anthropic 2024) achieve remarkable performance through\
    \ pre-training on large amounts of internet texts and rigorous alignment process\
    \ for safety enhancement.\nDespite the immense effort in safety research, LLMs\
    \ are still vulnerable to adversarial jailbreak attacks and can exhibit unwanted\
    \ behaviors (Shah et al. 2023; Chao et al. 2023; Zou et al. 2023b; Jones et al.\
    \ 2023; Yuan et al. 2024; Wei, Haghtalab, and Steinhardt 2024).\n\n\nMachine Unlearning (Cao\
    \ and Yang 2015; Chris Jay Hoofnagle and Borgesius 2019; Bourtoule et al. 2021;\
    \ Nguyen et al. 2022; Xu et al. 2023; Liu et al. 2024c) has emerged as a promising\
    \ method for mitigating unforeseen risks in LLMs before deployment.\nLi et al.\
    \ (2024b) introduced Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (RMU)—an unlearning\
    \ method that steers the representations of forget-samples (i.e. samples that\
    \ the model should forget) toward a random representation while keeping the representations\
    \ of retain-samples (i.e. samples that the model should remember) unchanged.\n\
    RMU significantly degrades models’ accuracy on forget-tasks, while only slightly\
    \ affecting the performance on retain-tasks and demonstrates stronger robustness\
    \ against adversarial jailbreak attacks.\nHowever, the reason for RMU’s effectiveness\
    \ is not well understood, hindering the development of better unlearning algorithms.\
    \ In this paper, we make the following contributions:\n\n\n•\n\nWe theoretically\
    \ analyze the impact of the RMU method on LLM unlearning.\n\n\n\n•\n\nWe investigate\
    \ the connection between RMU and adversarial robustness. We demonstrate that RMU\
    \ impedes the adversary’s ability to determine optimal updates for generating\
    \ adversarial samples, thus improving the adversarial robustness of the model.\n\
    \n\n\n•\n\nWe empirically show that the RMU forget loss, which minimizes the mean\
    \ squared error (MSE) between forget representation and a fixed scaled random\
    \ vector, fails to converge when the norm of the forget representation is larger\
    \ than the scaling coefficient, making RMU less effective when applied to middle\
    \ and last layers in LLMs.\n\n\n\n•\n\nTo overcome RMU’s limitation, we introduce\
    \ Adaptive RMU—a variant that adaptively adjusts the coefficient value based on\
    \ the norm of the forget representation. Experimental results show that Adaptive\
    \ RMU achieves higher drop-in-accuracy for forget knowledge, maintaining high\
    \ performance on general knowledge, and enables effective unlearning for most\
    \ layers without incurring additional computational overhead.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2\
    \ Background and related work\n\nMachine Unlearning.\n\nA natural is leave-some-out\
    \ retraining: retraining the model from scratch without the forget samples. However,\
    \ this method becomes more computationally expensive as the size of datasets and\
    \ modern deep networks grows. Existing works focus on approximating unlearning (Warnecke\
    \ et al. 2021; Izzo et al. 2021; Sekhari et al. 2021; Isonuma and Titov 2024)\
    \ using Influence Function (Koh and Liang 2017; Grosse et al. 2023), gradient\
    \ projection (Bae et al. 2023), gradient ascent (Thudi et al. 2022; Trippa et al.\
    \ 2024), second-order approximation (Jia et al. 2024), preference optimization (Zhang\
    \ et al. 2024b), and embedding corrupted (Liu et al. 2024a). Other views on the\
    \ landscape of machine unlearning include: unlearning in text classification (Ma\
    \ et al. 2022), image classification and recognition (Ginart et al. 2019; Golatkar,\
    \ Achille, and Soatto 2020; Fan et al. 2024; Choi and Na 2023; Cha et al. 2024),\
    \ image-to-image generative models (Li et al. 2024a), diffusion models (Gandikota\
    \ et al. 2023; Zhang et al. 2024a; Kumari et al. 2023), multimodal unlearning (Cheng\
    \ and Amiri 2023), federated unlearning (Liu et al. 2020a; Romandini et al. 2024;\
