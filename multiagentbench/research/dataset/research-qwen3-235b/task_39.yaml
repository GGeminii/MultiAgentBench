  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the fields of control systems,
    cyber-physical systems, and machine learning, with a particular focus on compositional
    approaches and security properties. My recent work has centered on developing
    opacity-preserving finite abstractions for networks of discrete-time nonlinear
    control systems, which addresses the growing security concerns in cyber-physical
    environments. I have introduced innovative simulation functions that maintain
    opacity properties while enabling the construction of interconnected symbolic
    models.


    In addition to my work on opacity, I have explored decentralized controller synthesis
    for discrete-time linear control systems, emphasizing the importance of local
    safety controllers that can be composed to ensure overall system safety. My research
    also delves into the intersection of game theory and blockchain technology, where
    I analyze announcement games to optimize system performance.


    I am particularly passionate about the integration of explainable AI (XAI) in
    machine learning, where I have developed methods to evaluate the correctness of
    feature attribution algorithms. My work on harmonization techniques for imaging
    data demonstrates my commitment to improving data consistency across diverse sources
    without the need for extensive data collection.


    As I continue to explore the challenges of secure-by-construction synthesis in
    cyber-physical systems, I aim to bridge the gap between safety and security, ensuring
    that our systems are not only effective but also resilient against potential threats.
    My research is driven by a desire to create robust, reliable systems that can
    operate safely in an increasingly complex and interconnected world.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to exploring the intersections of finance,
    artificial intelligence, and machine learning, particularly in the context of
    quantitative trading and dataset distillation. My recent work has focused on understanding
    the volatility and return dispersion in the S&P Health Care and Energy sectors
    during the COVID-19 pandemic, where I utilized innovative proxies like the Google
    index to model volatility and analyze the impact of the epidemic on stock returns.


    In the realm of dataset distillation, I have developed novel strategies to enhance
    the efficiency and effectiveness of synthetic data generation. My approach, Sequential
    Subset Matching (SeqMatch), addresses the limitations of static optimization methods
    by adaptively generating synthetic instances, significantly improving performance
    across various datasets. Additionally, I introduced the Inter-class Feature Compensator
    (INFER), which transcends traditional class-specific paradigms to optimize feature
    integration across classes, thereby enhancing the generalizability of distilled
    data.


    My work also extends to the application of AI and machine learning in quantitative
    trading, where I proposed QTNet, an adaptive trading model that leverages deep
    reinforcement learning and imitative learning to navigate the complexities of
    high-frequency financial data. By framing trading strategies within a Partially
    Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), I aim to create robust trading agents
    capable of adapting to dynamic market conditions.


    Through my research, I strive to bridge theoretical advancements with practical
    applications, providing insights that can guide investors and enhance the efficiency
    of machine learning methodologies in finance.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to advancing the field of embodied AI, particularly
    in the realm of long-horizon planning. My recent work centers around the development
    of ReLEP, a novel framework for Real-world Long-horizon Embodied Planning. Unlike
    previous approaches that rely heavily on GPT-4V for task decomposition, which
    can limit the diversity of tasks due to its predefined action constraints, ReLEP
    leverages a fine-tuned large vision language model. This model enables agents
    to formulate plans as sequences of skill functions tailored to specific instructions
    and scene images, drawn from a meticulously curated skill library.


    A key innovation in ReLEP is its Memory module, which allows for effective plan
    and status recall, alongside a Robot Configuration module that enhances versatility
    across different robot types. To address the challenge of dataset scarcity, I
    also introduced a semi-automatic data generation pipeline, ensuring that our framework
    is robust and adaptable. Through extensive offline experiments across eight daily
    embodied tasks, ReLEP has demonstrated its capability to accomplish complex long-horizon
    tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baseline methods. My work aims
    to push the boundaries of what embodied agents can achieve in real-world scenarios,
    paving the way for more intelligent and versatile AI systems.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher with a diverse background in stochastic dynamical systems,
    quantum mechanics, and federated learning, focusing on the intersection of these
    fields to address complex real-world problems. My recent work has involved developing
    stochastic contact Hamiltonian systems, where I established conditions for complete
    integrability and explored their dynamical properties. I have also analyzed the
    stability of stochastic models in ecological systems, revealing insights into
    prey-predator interactions under stochastic influences.


    In the realm of federated learning, I introduced DPBalance, a novel privacy budget
    scheduling mechanism that optimizes both efficiency and fairness, significantly
    improving performance metrics in collaborative model training. My research extends
    to federated analytics, where I proposed FedWeb, a framework that enhances privacy-preserving
    data analytics in Web 3.0 environments.


    Additionally, I have delved into quantum optics, studying the conditions for coherent
    perfect absorption in optical cavities, and explored the non-Markovian dynamics
    of photosynthetic systems, contributing to our understanding of quantum efficiency
    in biological processes. My work is characterized by a strong emphasis on theoretical
    foundations, complemented by rigorous numerical simulations and practical applications,
    aiming to bridge the gap between theory and real-world implementation. Through
    my research, I strive to advance our understanding of complex systems and contribute
    to the development of innovative solutions in emerging technologies.'

  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to enhancing robotic perception and interaction
    through the understanding of Task-Oriented Affordances of Objects (TOAO). My recent
    work, GauTOAO, introduces a Gaussian-based framework that leverages vision-language
    models to predict affordance-relevant regions of objects in a zero-shot manner.
    This innovative approach allows robots to better grasp and manipulate objects
    by focusing on specific parts relevant to the task at hand, significantly improving
    their performance in real-world scenarios.


    In addition to affordance understanding, I have developed ReLEP, a framework for
    Real-world Long-horizon Embodied Planning. This system enables robots to decompose
    complex tasks into actionable steps using a fine-tuned vision-language model and
    a versatile skill library. By incorporating a memory module for plan recall, ReLEP
    can effectively tackle a wide range of daily tasks, demonstrating superior performance
    in offline experiments compared to existing methods.


    My earlier research also explored signal processing algorithms aimed at improving
    speech recognition for hearing-impaired listeners. By manipulating spectral changes
    to focus on target-dominant segments, I developed algorithms that significantly
    enhance speech intelligibility in challenging auditory environments.


    Overall, my work bridges the gap between advanced AI techniques and practical
    applications, striving to create robots that can understand and interact with
    the world in a more human-like manner.'

    We are now ready to demonstrate the validity of Propo-\nsition 2.\nProof .First,\
    \ we examine the class-conditional ProCo loss,\ndenoted as Ez|yLProCo(y,z). For\
    \ a class label y∈ {− 1,1},\naccording to Lemma 2, we establish that with a probability\n\
    of at least 1−δ\n2, the following inequality holds:\nEz|yLProCo(y,z)−1\nNyX\n\

    \ Lemma 3 and Lemma 1, we obtain:\nEz|yLProCo(y,z)−1\nNyX\niLProCo(y,z)\n≤s\n\
    2Vz|y[Llin(y,z)] ln 2 /δ\nNy+ln(2/δ)\n3Nylog(1 + e||w||2−by)\nwhere Llin(y,z)is\
    \ defined as\n−y \n(µ+1−µ−1)⊤z\nτ+κ−1−κ+1\n2τ2κ−1κ+1+ logπ+1\nπ−1!\n.\nMoreover,\
    \ the variance Vz|y[Llin(y,z)]is computed as:\nVz|y[Llin(y,z)] =Vz|y[(µ+1−µ−1)⊤z/τ)]\n\
    = (µ+1−µ−1)⊤Σy(µ+1−µ−1)/τ2,\nwhere Σyrepresents the covariance matrix of zconditioned\n\

    \ generalization bound across all\nclasses, we apply the union bound. Consequently,\
    \ with aIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANAL YSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE 14\nprobability\
