  profile: 'I am a researcher dedicated to addressing critical challenges in healthcare
    and autonomous systems through innovative modeling and machine learning techniques.
    My recent work focuses on the alarming rise in diabetes cases, particularly exacerbated
    by the COVID-19 pandemic. I developed a predictive model that quantifies factors
    influencing hospital stay durations for diabetes patients, providing valuable
    insights for hospital administrators to enhance patient management strategies.
    This research underscores the importance of understanding urban-rural disparities
    in healthcare access and the financial implications of diabetes-related hospitalizations.


    In the realm of autonomous driving, I have contributed to advancing lane-changing
    decision-making through my novel framework, DRNet, which leverages deep reinforcement
    learning. This approach not only improves lane-changing efficiency but also incorporates
    safety verification to ensure that the agent makes safe driving decisions in complex
    environments.


    Additionally, I have explored the groundbreaking Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)
    for time series forecasting, proposing variants that enhance predictive accuracy
    and interpretability. My work on Wormhole, a deep representation learning framework,
    further emphasizes my commitment to understanding dynamic concepts in co-evolving
    sequences, providing tools for better decision-making in complex systems.


    Through my research, I aim to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements
    and practical applications, ensuring that my findings contribute to more effective
    healthcare management and safer autonomous systems.'

    \         **Introduction**\n\n             INTRODUCTION\nTime series data, capturing\
    \ complex systems dynamic behaviors,\nare widely collected in many research areas,\
    \ such as economics, bio-\ninformatics, and geo-informatics. Due to the rapid\
    \ advancements\nin sensor and computing technologies, there has been a significant\n\
    increase in research modeling time series data in recent years. Re-\nsearchers\
    \ have developed various RELATED WORK\nGranger Causal Structure Learning: Much\
    \ work has been con-\nducted on inferring causal structure based on Granger causality\
    \ in\nmultivariate time series. Recent approaches for inferring Granger\ncausal\
    \ structure leverage the expressive power of neural network\nand are often based\
    \ on regularized autoregressive models. [ 1] pro-\nposed the Lasso Granger method.\
    \ [ 39] proposed the sparse-input\nmulti-layer perceptron (MLP) and long short-term\
    \ memory (LSTM)\nto model the nonlinear Granger causality within multivariate\
    \ time\nseries. [ 21] integrated an efficient economy statistical recurrent\n\
    unit architecture with input layer wights regularized in a group-\nwise manner.\
    \ [ 28] proposed a generalized vector autoregression\nmodel that utilizes self-explaining\
    \ neural networks (SENNs) for\ninferring Granger causal structure, with an additional\
    \ focus on\ndetecting signs of Granger-causal effects. [ 4,5] proposed a Granger\n\
    causal discovery algorithm that builds a causal adjacency matrix\nfor imputed\
    \ and high-dimensional data using sparse regulariza-\ntion. Although these results,\
    \ demonstrating that our proposed Interven-\ntional Granger Causal ( IGC) structure\
    \ learning method outperforms\nexisting methodologies in both synthetic and real-world\
    \ datasets,\neven in the absence of interventional target information. Poten-\n\
    tial avenues for future research include applying our method to\na broader spectrum\
    \ of time series applications, which includes\ndetecting anomalies and root cause\
